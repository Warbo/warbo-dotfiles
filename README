# Warbo's Dotfiles #

Configuration for various applications. My convention is to remove the leading
dot, but otherwise keep filenames the same. This way it's easy for scripts to
put them in place.

The `check.sh` script isn't a dotfile, it performs sanity checks and is useful
as a git `pre-commit` hook.
