<p>Project Kronos, the short fake documentary by visual effects artist Hasraf ‘HaZ’ Dulull about first contact and the possible origins of interplanetary travel by humans in the relatively near future, recently got plenty of attention on the web. And it should have. It’s a well done piece of work, its premise is developed enough to keep you glued to the screen, and its pacing and storyline are open ended and somewhat disturbing enough to provoke a lot of speculation. As a piece of art, this is really, really good. But before anyone gets ideas about sending our artificially reanimated brains in spherical vessels to roam the cosmos in a dream-like state, I’m afraid that a skeptic will need to step in to do some fact checking on the science regardless of how well Project Kronos was put together. Considering that I’m in one of the key fields involved, it may as well be me, so let’s unpickle some flying cosmic brains and figure out whether you really want to analyze fuzzy dreams on your way to meet an alien intelligence trying to summon you to the stars.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, mapping the neurons responsible in remembering what someone saw could be done, and <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/gallantlabucb/publications/nishimoto-et-al-2011\" target=\"_blank\">there’s been some success in trying to see what another person has seen by looking through his memories</a>. With enough time and more accurate devices, it’s not implausible to get much better resolution, maybe even as good as some of the fuzzy images of the brain implanted into the Kronos probe. But then again, you’re spending hundreds of millions, if not billions to get to interstellar space. Don’t you want extremely powerful high resolution images taken with crystal clarity so scientists can study what the probe gleams on flyby? Don’t you want a sensor array to measure everything from the solar wind to atmosphere of the gas giants’ moons? The film’s very ambitious space agency basically decided to take a shortcut to nearly human equivalent AI with an actual human brain, then launched it into deep space bereft of the tools to make the probe a source of good data for planetary scientists, focusing instead of establishing first contact based on the idea that a human brain would handle aliens better than a recording. But would it?</p>
<p>One of the more disconcerting things for me in the documentary is the notion of the brain kept alive after the person using is has presumably died of natural causes. Now, as someone who’d happily donate his body to science after I’m done using it, on the one hand, I would welcome the opportunity of being essentially resurrected as a space probe. In fact, on the surface, it sounds like one of my wildest dreams come true. To be brought back to life in some form and launched to travel the stars for eons on end. The concept is poetic, really. But the reality? Not so much. It would be the most extreme kind of sensory deprivation you could imagine. Yes, you could travel the cosmos and see planets no one has even seen before, but for the vast majority of the trip, you’d be surrounded by silent blackness. No friends, no family, very little interaction from Earth, and most of said interaction would be one way. Your thoughts and memories would be decoded and played back like a movie, complete with images of the life you once lead. What you have to look forward to is eons of solitary confinement in a completely alien environment.</p>
<p>Of course this is presuming that your brain will still be usable after death. Unlike the machine, it will deteriorate. Over time its functions will degrade, memories would be difficult to keep, and the probe will grow less and less reliable. Add this to the isolation it will experience and any aliens in range of a Kronos orb will more than likely be trying to make contact with an entity suffering from mental illness and with rapidly deteriorating cognitive abilities. At this point, a recording would be much more preferable. Now, you might wonder if the brain in a Kronos probe would actually live in any real sense. After all, it is just being zapped with a little electricity and given some nutrients so it can function but it’s not really embodied anymore and kept in a dream-like state. The film is not really clear on this point, oscillating between the scientists treating the brain as a substrate, and indicating that it would be capable of an emotional response, meaning that it may be sort of alive in a conventional sense. Maybe this is why the Human 2.0 project meant to respond to the alien attempt at first contact uses a fleet of probes. Maybe they’ll keep each other sane.</p>
<p>Still, note that first contact happens after aliens hack a human brain in robot form. That’s a very disconcerting feat. It means that the extraterrestrial life form either managed to figure out binary protocols for our electronics and how they map to analog buzz produced by our neurons, or had a machine capable of doing that. More than likely, they’ve either done it before or developed an absolutely amazing grasp on how to decipher brain machine interfaces in other species. They’d have to basically torture the brain in Kronos to figure this out from scratch, not on purpose, but they would more or less have to wire into the orb and zap the brain to see what happens so the inference map for how it works could be built. Does sending a hundred more Kronos probes to the coordinates they provided seem like a good idea in this light? Certainly not to me. Seems a tad dangerous to put it mildly. Sure it’s first contact, but with what and why? I could imagine this encounter suddenly diverting trillions around the world into building a heavily armed space fleet just in case, should the memories of the Kronos brain give the aliens too much information.</p>
<p>But all this aside, I can understand what Project Kronos was trying to show. Humans, as we are today, are more or less marooned on Earth. We’re not ready to live in deep space until we start to change ourselves through genetic engineering and significant augmentation, until we defeat aging as we know it and learn how to encase our bodies in materials that will keep us save from radiation and let us stand on other worlds without worrying about toxic chemicals, radiation, and the bone, joint, and muscle damage from changing gravities. The odds of us being brains in tiny orbs floating through the vastness of space are non-zero, especially if bean counters have their way with the future of space travel, but it’s not the best way to explore the final frontier. No, the best way forward for us is roaming space stations, vast interstellar ships, and cyborg bodies. It’s our need to be social, our embodiment, and our sense of community and adventure that define us, and if we want to boldly go into interstellar space, we need to carry them with us. That and a lot of weapons in case random aliens start giving us trouble by trying to hack into our brains…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F19%2Fwhy-we-cant-follow-project-kronos-blueprint%2F&title=why%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20follow%20project%20kronos%E2%80%99%20blueprint\" id=\"wpa2a_2\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/19/why-we-cant-follow-project-kronos-blueprint/#comments" "8ea7a6bd2efd057dac8fa9848a37f629") (59 (20949 25781 874918) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/15/the-infinitely-vast-mandatory-miltiverse/" "the infinitely vast, mandatory multiverse?"

<p>At two events of the <a href=\"http://worldsciencefestival.com/events/cosmic_conjecture\" target=\"_blank\">Wolrd Science Festival</a> in early June,  a group of five theoretical physicists debated whether we’re living in a multiverse, and more surprisingly, if our current understanding of the cosmos all but mandates that multiple universes exist. It all goes back to the instant of the Big Bang, the femtosecond that set the rules for all reality as we know it in scientific terms. Each tiny little quantum instability and flux was stretched and projected across billions of light years to influence the shape of galaxy clusters and the tiny filaments what underpin <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/01/15/did-the-cosmological-principle-get-knocked-down/\">our mostly isotropic, homogeneous universe</a>. It’s kind of like the chaos theory saying about a flap of a butterfly’s wings eventually causing a tsunami halfway across the world, but taken to incredible extremes. We’re talking about a change in point particles becoming an archipelago a million galaxies across. So, why wouldn’t some of these instabilities become their own universes, sealed off from each other by the fabric of space and time? The inflation we just described should make this inevitable.</p>
<p>Here’s the issue. As our infant universe was inflating, it shouldn’t have spun off uniformly since that would make the fluctuations in early matter impossible and prevented the formation of stars and galaxies. It would’ve had to have large enough disruptions to kick-start other universes, or even itself be a product of another universe undergoing rapid inflation. And if one universe can inflate, so too must the rest because otherwise, inflation becomes a unique event and science is not happy with a one-off event as an explanation. Every significant process we know of happens more than once and on universal time scales of countless trillions of years, the possibilities are pretty much infinite. We should be able to see new universes bubbling up from dark voids in the fabric of space-time, over time. There might even be room to imagine a bizarre, hyper-advanced species of the far future crossing into a brand new universe as theirs dies in a void ship isolated from reality as we know it, Doctor Who-style, hopefully one that’s nothing like the Daleks.</p>
<p>Problem is, how do we prove that inflation works in more than one universe when we can’t see into the multiverse? One suggestion is that inflation basically wraps the universe into a sphere, an unbreachable, self-contained environment that seems flat to us and where trying to travel to the edge of the cosmos will result in the spaceship ending up back where it started as if it were on a Mobius strip. Simple, elegant, and convenient as far as solutions to cosmological problems go, don’t you think? And that’s precisely what’s so bothersome about it. Nothing in cosmology is that simple, even inflation itself. Instead of slowing down, it’s accelerating. Instead of flying apart into clouds of stars and gas under their own momentum, galaxies are keeping their shapes until a collision distorts them thanks to invisible dark matter. Hell, some 96% of the universe isn’t even matter and almost three quarters of it is some mysterious energy feeding its expansion. Does it really make sense that in a universe like that simple, convenient explanations will fly?</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F15%2Fthe-infinitely-vast-mandatory-miltiverse%2F&title=the%20infinitely%20vast%2C%20mandatory%20multiverse%3F\" id=\"wpa2a_4\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/15/the-infinitely-vast-mandatory-miltiverse/#comments" "1328f2f9a7a18def48251168b62dca56") (58 (20949 25781 874008) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/12/how-to-approach-a-problem-with-mind-wide-shut/" "how to approach a problem with mind wide shut" "Greg Fish" "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 21:44:20 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/evo_marketing_440.jpg?resize=440%2C330\" alt=\"evolution marketing / darwin fish design\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7131\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Alarmed by the growing number of atheists among the current generation of young adults, one organization of Christians decided to sit some down for an interview to learn why they became atheists, drew conclusions, summed them up, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/listening-to-young-atheists-lessons-for-a-stronger-christianity/276584/\" target=\"_blank\">and respectfully posted them online</a>. Unlike many other faith groups, they legitimately wanted to understand what atheists thought and why, and what prompted their de-conversions. Problem is that they didn’t want to understand if all those atheists they interviewed had a point when discussing the improbability of an omniscient deity in their lives, ruling the universe from afar, yet being involved in the fate of every living thing. They were running a focus group to see what it would take to put those atheists back in the pews in a classic example of listening but not hearing. In their worldview, the inability of a pastor to prove that their faith is based on facts rather than tradition is the failure of a pastor since the infallibility of the religion is assumed as an unquestionable given.</p>
<p>The tone of the summary is almost clinical, like a psychiatrist surveying his patients and dutifully describing their pathologies to be analyzed by others. And while listing the reasons why atheists leave churches or never enter one, the piece recited a mantra declaring that Christianity is hard to understand, difficult to live up to, and teaches us to engage with the real world. As if a belief that an omniscient, omnipotent being incarnated as his own son to forgive humans for what he declared to be sins through self-sacrifice is as scientifically well proven as the structure of DNA. This is why this so-called \"interfatih dialogue\" is a bad idea for atheists. They’re not participants with a voice who get to express their views in a debate. They’re either patients to be studied for the future, or potential new believers yet to be swayed as far as the faithful are concerned. Yes, they might act like the nicest people in the world, but they’re not listening to you. They’re looking at you like a biologist looks at a dolphin and wondering how to teach you to do a trick…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F12%2Fhow-to-approach-a-problem-with-mind-wide-shut%2F&title=how%20to%20approach%20a%20problem%20with%20mind%20wide%20shut\" id=\"wpa2a_6\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/12/how-to-approach-a-problem-with-mind-wide-shut/#comments" "00c93192d2905e38ce18b6ed27ca6013") (57 (20949 25781 873171) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/11/social-media-the-best-way-to-share-with-friends-family-and-nsa-analysists/" "social media, the best way to share with friends, family, and nsa analysists" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 21:21:41 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/surveillance_camera_array_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"surveillance camera array\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16600\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>On the one hand, I am somewhat surprised by recent revelations about exactly how much we’re being watched on the internet by the NSA. However, the big surprise for me is that they couldn’t get data form Twitter. Considering that <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/03/22/how-would-the-nsa-surf-a-tsunami-of-data/\">it’s building an immense data center in Utah</a>, and works with tech companies on a regular basis, is it really that astonishing that the agency is browsing through our communications metadata on a regular basis? We all suspected this was the case, so if anything the current furor is almost a required reaction of anger and hurt to have what we always thought was happening and didn’t really want to, actually is happening. The question is what to do now, in the PRISM-aware world. Citizens know they’re being caught up in the dragnet when they’re just going about their day, foreign companies are afraid of the NSA spying on them via the advanced cloud technology the United States sells across the globe, and China could sit back and laugh off American reports of its hacking and spying on the web as hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Another fun fact is that Americans are actually split on how they feel about the NSA’s snooping and a majority of 56% <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/10/majority-views-nsa-phone-tracking-as-acceptable-anti-terror-tactic/\" target=\"_blank\">says that privacy is an acceptable casualty in trying to catch terrorists</a>. It might also be telling that the split hasn’t changed much since 2006 and that it breaks down by a distinct partisan preference, with liberals and conservatives flip-flopping on the issue when the other party was in the White House. So while the press is incensed and investigative reporters are falling all over themselves to talk about PRISM, the American people are shrugging it off by party affiliation. I would expect everyone to carry on as normal because if Facebook and Google didn’t have a mass exodus of accounts, it’s very unlikely they will. Plus, the NSA isn’t reading all the e-mail in your inbox. It just has a record of you e-mailing someone at a given time and if you are in the United States, your phone number and e-mail should be crossed out in their system, until of course a secret court order grants the analysis access to request the whole e-mail.</p>
<p>Even the slowdown in purchases of American high tech gear is likely to be temporary because much of what we’re hearing from many other countries is an almost mandatory response to the revelations about PRISM. In reality, many of the countries buying these tech products have very extensive spy networks of their own and engage in cyber-espionage on a daily basis. It’s kettle calling the pot black, and it’s likely that the rumors of tech companies giving the NSA back door access into their servers are just not true. There’s a number of ways to supply data to the NSA and a number of ways the NSA could’ve gotten the data itself. I’m not going to speculate how in this post because a) I don’t know the agency’s exact capabilities, b) there are people from both defense contractors and military agencies reading this blog who I’d just annoy with speculating, and c) most of them are probably much worse than having the companies just play ball when a court order comes down and an incredibly powerful agency is knocking on their door.</p>
<p>Now, none of this means this isn’t a big deal. But what it does signal is that the country which is dominating the world in the tech field and serves as the key node in the global communications grid <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/02/20/how-cyberwarfare-is-becoming-the-new-black/\">has been crying wolf about cyberwarfare and espionage</a> while actively waging it. We were starting to be sure of this when Stuxnet was discovered, we suspected it even stronger when all of its ingenious siblings like Flame and Duqu floated into the spotlight, we had a good idea that the United State was publicly holding back when reports of its potential in cyberwarfare drills with allied nations started surfacing, and with PRISM, we now know it for a fact. On the one hand, it’s bad news because your privacy is now not only being compromised by bad security or very lax internal policies of web giants, but by the government as well. On the other, we know that we’re hardly defenseless in the cyber realm and will fight and spy right back. Make of these facts what you will. It’s not like we can put this genie back in its virtual bottle anyway…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F11%2Fsocial-media-the-best-way-to-share-with-friends-family-and-nsa-analysists%2F&title=social%20media%2C%20the%20best%20way%20to%20share%20with%20friends%2C%20family%2C%20and%20nsa%20analysists\" id=\"wpa2a_8\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/11/social-media-the-best-way-to-share-with-friends-family-and-nsa-analysists/#comments" "174ac85472f0dd744e857f4e719b4e87") (56 (20949 25781 872073) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/10/why-mars-is-not-the-next-apollo/" "why mars is not the next apollo" "Greg Fish" "Mon, 10 Jun 2013 12:15:22 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/approach_to_mars_600.jpg?resize=600%2C330\" alt=\"approach to mars\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15740\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>According to Wired’s <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/05/actually-getting-to-mars/?pid=6958&viewall=true\" target=\"_blank\">laundry list of technical and political issues with getting humans to Mars by the year 2030 or so</a>, exploring another planet many millions of miles away won’t be Apollo 2.0 in many ways. It will be an order of magnitude more expensive per launch, require 30 months for a round trip, and needs to be financed, overseen, and executed by an international group that will include space agencies and ambitious aerospace companies with plans and launch vehicles of their own. And yet, the designs being drawn up sound remarkably like Apollo on steroids. We’re basically working with the same basic mission plans we had in the 1980s with a few workarounds for handling fuel and oxygen. Come on folks, this is another planet. It’s not just a status symbol and <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/03/02/why-a-flyby-of-mars-may-not-live-up-to-its-intention/\">we don’t need to rush there just to say we went</a>. Really, we don’t. Flag planting is great for propaganda and PR purposes, but it’s disastrous for long term exploration, which needs to be a very boring, consistent, and yes, expensive effort. We need a better plan than this.</p>
<p>Now, as much as this blog will support my assertion that I’m all about space exploration and will go as far as to advocate augmenting humans to travel into deep space (which led to numerous arguments with the Singularity Institute’s fellows), we don’t have to go to Mars as soon as we’re able to launch. It’s been there for 4.5 billion years. It’s not going anywhere for at least another five billion, and we owe it to ourselves to do it right. This is why instead of sending a much bigger capsule or an updated ISS for a 30 month round trip, we need to send inflatable, rotating space stations powered by small nuclear reactors. Instead of landers, we need to send self-assembling habitats. Instead of going to Mars to stick a flag into the ground, collect rocks, and do some very brief and limited experiments to look for traces of organic compounds, we need to commit to an outright colonization effort, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/04/30/why-we-need-to-return-to-the-moon/\">and we need to test the basics on the Moon before we go</a>. We won’t fulfill our dreams of roaming the stars and living on alien worlds if we don’t get this right.</p>
<p>Yes, it sounds downright crazy to propose something like that, especially thanks to the political climates of today. And it is. But at the risk of repeating myself, when we have trillions of banks to erase their bad bets from the books and nothing to aid the paltry budgets of space agencies or labs working on the technology of the future, the issue isn’t money. It’s priorities, vision, and will, and today’s politicians have the first one skewed, and more often than not either lack the other two, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/30/why-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science/\">or envision our society going backwards</a> as if this is a good thing. And we can keep right on placating ourselves by saying that we’ll at least get to roam around the solar system a bit like we did once, but that’s not how we should be exploring space. We know it’s not. if you want to really reach out into space, you go in for the long term with your eye on the spin-offs and benefits that will rain down from massive, ambitious, integrated projects that try to do what’s never been done before not by reinventing the wheel, but by attaching said wheel to a new airplane.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F10%2Fwhy-mars-is-not-the-next-apollo%2F&title=why%20mars%20is%20not%20the%20next%20apollo\" id=\"wpa2a_10\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/10/why-mars-is-not-the-next-apollo/#comments" "9ea4dec631f252819ee5441655e9af57") (55 (20949 25781 871107) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/08/the-impotent-cry-against-reason-and-logic/" "the impotent cry against reason and logic" "Greg Fish" "Sat, 08 Jun 2013 19:02:34 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/far_future_city_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"far future city\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16759\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Ever since the New Atheists arrived on the scene, there’s be a loud, wailing siren from religious and humanities pundits decrying the idea that we could use science to explain the universe that we occupy. Generally their argument for why we can’t use reason and experiments to clear up a lot of mysteries and what makes us tick <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2013/06/the_science_delusion_by_curtis_white_reviewed.single.html\" target=\"_blank\">boils down to \"how dare you say you can explain all this complexity and wonder in math and mechanistic descriptions?\"</a> And that’s really as far as it goes because their objection to using science to explain their pet topics in the language of formulas, statistics, and data sets is that it takes away a mystery they so desperately wanted to preserve for another sermon or tome of nebulous ponderings on the human condition. While researchers and engineers see the beauty in knowing how things work, science-phobic pontificators rush to the fainting couches, distraught that someone dare to explain their minds as sprawling networks neurons and accumulated experience alongside evolutionary mechanisms.</p>
<p>If you’re one of those people who needs to be a mysterious, delicate snowflake who is just way too complicated and nuanced to study, I’m sorry, but we can’t help you. Knowing how the world around us works in scientific, mechanistic language is how we build modern societies, land on a different world, send robots into deep space, and find cures for what ails us. If you refuse to see how knowing what makes the universe tick gives your existence even more meaning and a very enviable ability to modify the world to accomplish something, even to a small extent, that is your personal problem. Now, far be it from me to say that literature or religions never made profound contributions to humanity because they have. But what they couldn’t do was to find and confirm solid, experimentally proven, reliable answers to big questions about who we are and where we might be going. Science has given us a vast, complex, mysterious universe, and they’re upset that we can derive some algebra to try and explain how a few bits of it fit together?</p>
<p>Consider this. If you’re loudly and publicly rebelling against the scourge of \"arrogant scientism\" but you’ve ever tried something to find out what will happen and then repeated your experiment to confirm it, you’re a hypocrite. You relied on the scientific method to answer your question, not those nebulous \"other ways of knowing.\" Come to think of it, what are all of these \"other ways of knowing\" we hear invoked so often by both a fundamentalist zealot with a mind wide shut, and a crunchy New Ager with equal zeal? Voices of an omnipotent deity? The universe telling you that we’re all connected <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/05/09/how-new-agers-escape-the-human-condition/\">in a creationist fantasy for left wing anti-intellectuals</a>? That’s just your brain making shit up to put it bluntly. You can attend philosophical seminars and conventions of tweed suit-clad graybeards, huffing and puffing, and looking serious, saying \"isn’t life so mysterious?\" as Tim Minchin once put it, and rage against the fact that science can explain things that were once said to be off limits to mere mortals. It won’t change the fact that it’s our ability to explore, dissect, catalog, explain, and predict though science that makes us who we are.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F08%2Fthe-impotent-cry-against-reason-and-logic%2F&title=the%20impotent%20cry%20against%20reason%20and%20logic\" id=\"wpa2a_12\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/08/the-impotent-cry-against-reason-and-logic/#comments" "f28597099d3a1e8d77401a0b13087e15") (54 (20949 25781 866923) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/04/does-meeting-online-mean-a-better-marriage-sort-of-but-dont-get-carried-away/" "does meeting online mean a better marriage? sort of, but =?utf-8?Q?don=E2=80=99t?= get carried =?utf-8?Q?away=E2=80=A6?=" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 04 Jun 2013 21:54:09 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/newlyweds_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"newlyweds\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16751\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>There’s been a bit of a splash by a new study which says that meeting your spouse online could mean a longer, happier marriage, and confirms that far from being the last refuge of lonely shut-ins, online dating is now one of the top ways to meet your mate. Now, the numbers do bear this conclusion out. Out of a representative sample of 19,131 people, the researchers found that a couple that met online is 28% less likely to divorce than their offline matched counterparts, and that the happiest marriages start with a meeting in MMORPGs and on social networks. However, and you knew this was coming, the differences are statistically significant but far from huge, and there are several caveats to taking the findings too close to heart, caveats which result directly from the study’s design. Basically, they’re collecting some demographic information if a subject was married between 2005 and 2012, asking how the subject met his or her spouse, and how happy the marriage seems, then looking for any statistically notable trends to emerge.</p>
<p>Here’s what the data mining found. A smidgen more than a third of the subjects (35%) married a person they met online. Half of those meetings happened on a dating site, usually eHarmony or Match.com, which each claim a quarter of these dating site meetups. So if you’re looking to get into a serious relationship or get married, those sites are probably a very good bet. Likewise, a few very interesting data points jump out from the results. The more well educated and gainfully employed you are, the more likely you are to meet a serious partner online. Those who earn at least $75,000 per year and have a college education represent some 57% of relationships that started online. Oddly enough, those with graduate degrees have the lowest share of marriages to partners they met online, under 15% of the total. The data doesn’t show why, but I would be interested in figuring this out. Why is this finding so worthy of attention? Because it may have a connection to <a href=\"http://economy.money.cnn.com/2012/05/02/the-rich-are-working-harder/\" target=\"_blank\">the so-called leisure inequality</a> and tell us more about why online dating grown so much in the last decade or so. But I digress. Now, what about that marriage satisfaction?</p>
<p>Well, again, the numbers do show that people who married their online friends report a better marriage, especially those who met playing online games or on social networks (which could or could not include dating sites, the paper isn’t specific on this). On a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being the equivalent of \"I’m ready to file for divorce this second\" and 7 being \"this marriage is perfect,\" these subjects reported an average satisfaction score of 5.72, which is pretty damn good. But if we consider the score of the most miserable married couples who met offline in a bar or through a blind date, they still post a very respectable 5.35 average. Yes, the online couples are happy and they’re happier than many other couples, but not by leaps and bounds. Could you really tell the difference between a 5.35 and a 5.72 happy when general contentment is 3.5? If we indulge in paraphrasing Futurama, these researchers are techncially correct, the best kind of correct in science. But practically, they just found close to 20,000 happy couples, a third of which just so happened to have met online and got married in a certain time range.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the biggest caveat with this study. Only 8% of these subjects are divorced which is both, a lot lower than the national average, and only shows the short term trend. If you look at marriages 10 years out rather than the seven for this survey, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr049.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the odds of a divorce are about 30% or so</a>. Get 20 years out and the odds increase to 48% on the high end. The sample here just hasn’t been married long enough and it’s probably a safe assumption that a lot were caught in their early phases of marriage. But the goal for getting married generally tends to be staying married for life, which means roughly half a century, going by the typical life expectancy figures. The researchers are, in a sense, catching people a mile or two into a marathon when a whole lot usually hasn’t happened yet and the biggest bumps in the road are still ahead, getting a general thumbs up from some 92% of the respondents, and splitting hairs about who gave the most enthusiastic thumbs up. True, this doesn’t mean that there’s a problem with a marriage to someone you met online and yes, maybe these couples are happier. But it’s too soon to tell.</p>
<p>Likewise, we should also point out <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/06/how-to-live-in-a-world-where-marriage-is-in-decline/276476/\" target=\"_blank\">that marriage rates keep on falling</a> and the domestic partner has been slowly becoming the new spouse. After witnessing messy divorces and confronted by general antipathy for marriage from many sides, a lot of people who would’ve already tied the knot are deciding to forgo the whole affair altogether. Now, this could mean that what the survey captured is a trend of people who get married staying together longer and being happier while more and more of their peers are opting out of married life, balancing out the high divorce rate over the next decade or so, but this is just an idea after looking at the data. Marriage as we are used to it in the modern world is changing. It’s becoming less commonplace, involves those who are more financially secure, and alternative households are becoming the new norm. So in light of all these changes, maybe the better question to ask is not what makes for a happier marriage but what makes for happy long term relationships, or at least what today’s long term relationship looks like from an academic standpoint. Work in that area is only beginning…</p>

<p>According to the stream of reports from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the Arctic ice is slowly but surely disappearing. Well, slowly for us humans. On geologic time scales, it’s thawing in the blink of an eye. For this year, the extent of the ice is <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2013/03/annual-maximum-extent-reached/\" target=\"_blank\">the sixth lowest on record</a>, and last year, there was about <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/charctic-interactive-sea-ice-graph/\" target=\"_blank\">half as much ice at minimum as there was between 1979 and 2000</a>, while also being much thinner. On the other side of the world, Antarctica is not doing much better as an average of <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/20100108_Is_Antarctica_Melting.html\" target=\"_blank\">100 cubic kilometers of ice are lost every year</a>, despite ice sliding into the ocean from dry land seemingly increasing the reach of sea ice. Now, this prompted many denialists to distribute a talking point that while the Arctic is melting, Antarctica is gaining ice, which would be true only if you measure sea ice and forget that there’s an entire continent thawing, sending all that excess ice out to sea. It’s sort of like claiming a virgin birth by forgetting to mention that the couple isn’t married and the child’s father lives across town, visiting every other day.</p>
<p>But all this said, there’s the big question is how bad all this thawing is for us. Sea levels may rise between 16 and 22 feet, changing coastlines and altering climactic cycles over a century. How worried should we be? And is there any way to stop it? Well, exactly how worried you should be would depend on where you live and whether you think another century is too short of a time to move the cities back from the sea. The world is not going to flood as shown in many apocalyptic posters from environmental groups. To drown a city like that would require massive and sudden natural disasters like asteroid impacts or a magnitude 9.1 quake that triggers a monster tsunami and sends it towards a city built mostly below sea level. No city planner 30 or 70 years from now would be dealing with the same exact coastlines, and old buildings could be moved or altered to deal with the rising water. Of course, if we didn’t emit nearly as much carbon dioxide by building our economies around energy efficiency, we could just avoid all of that in the first place.</p>
<p>Though, just to play Devil’s advocate, there’s an interesting point that needs to be raised. New economies and infrastructures are expensive. Very expensive. And the thawing Arctic means a shorter path between Europe, Asia, and North America than the Panama Canal. Goods can get to their destinations cheaper, new fiber can be laid for a faster, more redundant internet, and a lot of oil and natural gas will be open to exploration far away from the Middle East. And while as the United States and Canada extract more and more oil from the Arctic, OPEC could just lower production to keep prices high, the political ramifications are huge and to many, worth perusing. Is potential energy independence that will let the United States disentangle itself from the Middle East and its messy affairs, while creating new jobs and cozy ties with its neighbors worth moving some big cities back from the rising seas? And do the improved economics of fast, new shipping lanes and extra fiber-optic cables just sweeten the deal to let it all melt?</p>
<p>Before we get carried away though, there is a downside to such strategic terraforming. Warmer climates mean more droughts in areas that are now among the world’s bread baskets, and a lot less food. In some countries, which produce far more food than they can consume or send over as aid, this isn’t a pressing issue. But in countries not producing enough, or just barely enough to get by, famines could easily reemerge because the farmlands couldn’t be moved to land that belongs to another state. For nations on good terms, there might be a deal in the making. For countries that view each other as an existential threat (like India and Pakistan), not so much. Oh and bad news for foodies. When food sources become any scarcer in a warmer world, the only viable response is doubling down on hyper-efficient factory farms that employ methods that can drive a panel of Food Network chefs up a wall. Point is that your experience with the effects of a warmer Earth may vary depending on many factors, but deciding how to manage the warming is not as cut and dry as a yes or a no, there’s an economic and geopolitical calculus involved…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F02%2Fyes-the-ice-caps-are-melting-but-is-that-bad%2F&title=yes%2C%20the%20ice%20caps%20are%20melting%2C%20but%20is%20that%20bad%3F\" id=\"wpa2a_16\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/02/yes-the-ice-caps-are-melting-but-is-that-bad/#comments" "99170ac7a2dc4969ee0add5a5d96561b") (52 (20949 25781 864348) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/31/how-to-create-a-self-fulfilling-anti-tech-prophecy-with-withering-cynicism/" "how to create a self-fulfilling anti-tech prophecy with withering cynicism" "Greg Fish" "Fri, 31 May 2013 14:00:05 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dubai_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"dubai_600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16740\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Last time we took a look at <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/03/and-now-for-a-little-technophobic-paternalism/\">what tech cynics and technophobes get wrong in their arguments</a>, we focused on their lack of consideration for their fellow humans’ ability to exercise free will. Despite the fact that this is a huge hole in many of their arguments, there’s an even bigger problem with the dismissive stance they take towards science and technology. When they argue that we can’t feed all the hungry  house all the homeless, or really prolong lifespans with technology, the facts they cite generally point not so much to technological limitations or scientific ignorance, but very convoluted social and political problems, then insist that because science and technology can’t solve them today, they likely never will, or won’t solve them adequately to consider the problem much smaller than it is today. While this argument is true, it’s also logically dishonest. You can’t fix the world’s problems with technology when the people who should be using it refuse to do so, or hijack it for their own less than noble means. No tool or piece of knowledge can help then.</p>
<p>As some of you might have noticed, the city in the graphic for this post in Dubai, a rich proving ground for how the cities of the near future are likely to be built. We know how to make cities of glass, steel, and concrete right out of science fiction. We know how to build the cheap, efficient housing complexes those making less than a dollar a day need to at least have secure shelter. We know how do diagnose complex diseases early enough to treat them before they’ll become dangerous, much less terminal, and our toolkits for understanding germs, viruses, and complex medical problems like cancers, are growing to become more sophisticated every day. We also have the tools and the money to apply all these solutions to the world at large. With something a little bit short of $100 billion just between Gates and Buffet pledged to fight poverty  illiteracy, and disease, and when we can find $2 trillion laying around to help banks with a do-over, clearly, it’s not an issue of not having the technology, the scientific basis, or the cash. The issue is will.</p>
<p>Sure technological utopians have lofty ambitions and <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/08/08/when-technocrats-think-theyre-better-than-you/\">it’s valid to be skeptical of many of them</a>, but when they vow that logistical problems can be solved with enough computing and research, they’re right more often than not. When the cynics deride these ambitions by pointing out that a lot of people don’t want to fund mass production of the necessary tools or the required science, and would much prefer to spend them on entertainment and public entitlements benefiting them directly, they’re not highlighting the problems with using technology to save the world, they’re a prime exhibit of why a technology hasn’t transformed the world of fixed a persistent problem. All too often it comes down to them saying it can’t be done, and politicians along with voters simply listening to them and deciding that no, it’s can’t be done since the critics said so, which is why it would be a waste of time to even bother. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure, a social variation of Newton’s First Law: a society that insists on the status quo, sticks to the status quo unless an external event or constant pressure forces it to change. </p>
<p>It’s the same attitude <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/08/11/whats-holding-back-modern-science-and-technology/\">which strangled the promising and much anticipated future of space travel and exploration</a>, and we’re still stuck with it. Yes, not every retro-futuristic dream about space or living on other worlds was practical or even feasible  and yes, we did need experts to burst our bubble before an unworkable project got off the ground. But today’s science and tech critics are going well past a healthy skepticism about bold claims and venturing into a territory in which they dismiss scientific and technological solutions to global problems for the sake of dismissing them, pointing to other ideas they dismissed in the past and doomed to being chained to the drawing board, and saying that because their relentless cynicism killed the ideas rather than refined the scopes and missions to eliminate problems with them, new ideas building on past visions must be scrapped as well. It’s even more insidious than <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/30/why-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science/\">political vetting of basic science</a>, because vetting at least allows some projects to survive and get refined into new tools and ideas. The withering cynicism of what science and technology can do for us is like an anti-innovation WMD…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F31%2Fhow-to-create-a-self-fulfilling-anti-tech-prophecy-with-withering-cynicism%2F&title=how%20to%20create%20a%20self-fulfilling%20anti-tech%20prophecy%20with%20withering%20cynicism\" id=\"wpa2a_18\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/31/how-to-create-a-self-fulfilling-anti-tech-prophecy-with-withering-cynicism/#comments" "92c5c437e6bef4b0e21e8de25cf2244a") (51 (20949 25781 861020) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/29/why-scientists-really-dont-need-the-input-of-philosophers-like-raymond-tallis/" "why scientists really =?utf-8?Q?don=E2=80=99t?= need the input of philosophers like raymond tallis" "Greg Fish" "Wed, 29 May 2013 14:33:11 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/grumpy_cat_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"grumpy_cat_600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16736\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>A long time ago, I shared one of my favorite jokes about philosophers. It went like this. Once, a president of a large and prestigious university was asked who were his most expensive staff to fund. \"Phycisists and computer scientists,\" he replied without hesitation, \"they always want some brand new machine that costs a fortune to build and operate, not like mathematicians who only need paper, pencils, and erasers. Or better yet, my philosophers. Those guys don’t even need the erasers!\" Yes, yes, I know, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/07/15/trying-to-find-the-limits-of-philosophy/\">I’m a philosophical phillistine</a>, I’ve been told of this so many times that I should start some sort of contest. But my lack of reverence for the discipline is not helped by philosophers who decide to speak up for their occupation in an age of big data and powerful, new tools for scientific experimentation to propose answers to new and ever more complex real world questions. Case in point, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/27/physics-philosophy-quantum-relativity-einstein\" target=\"_blank\">a column by Raymond Tallis</a> declaring that physics is broken so much so that it needs metaphysics to pull itself back together and produce real results.</p>
<p>Physics is a discipline near and dear to my heart because certain subsets of it can be applied to cutting edge hardware, and as someone whose primary focus is distributed computing, the area of computer science which gives us all our massive web applications, cloud storage, and parallel processing, there’s a lot of value in keeping up with the relevant underlying science. And maybe there’s already an inherent bias here when my mind starts to wonder how metaphysics will help someone build a quantum cloud or <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/01/14/to-boost-data-density-chill-and-apply-magnetism/\">radically increase hard drive density</a>, but the bigger problem is that Tallis doesn’t seem to have any command of the scientific issues he declares to be in dire need of graybeards in tweed suits pondering the grand mechanics of existence with little more than the p’s and q’s of propositional logic. For example, take his description of why physics has chased itself into a corner with quantum mechanics…</p>
<blockquote><p>A better-kept secret is that at the heart of quantum mechanics is a disturbing paradox – the so-called measurement problem, arising ultimately out of the Uncertainty Principle – which apparently demonstrates that the very measurements that have established and confirmed quantum theory should be impossible. Oxford philosopher of physics David Wallace has argued that this threatens to make quantum mechanics incoherent which can be remedied only by vastly multiplying worlds.</p></blockquote>
<p>As science bloggers love to say, this isn’t even wrong. Tallis and Wallace have mixed up three very different concepts into a grab bag of confusion. Quantum mechanics can do <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/04/27/oh-quantum-causality-we-hardly-knew-ye/\">very, very odd things that seem to defy the normal flow of time</a>, but there’s nothing that says we can’t know the general topology of a quantum system. The oft cited and abused Uncertainty Principle is based on the fact that certain fundamental building blocks of the universe can function as both a wave and a particle, and each state has its own set of measurements. If you try to treat the blocks as particles, you can measure the properties of the particle state. If you try to treat them as waves, you can only measure the properties of the waves. The problem is that you can’t get both at the same exact time because you have to choose which state you measure. However, what you can do is create <a href=\"http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/quantum/style_a/packets.html\" target=\"_blank\">a wave packet</a>, where you should get a good, rough approximation of how the block behaves in both states. In other words, measurement of quantum systems is very possible.</p>
<p>All right, so this covers the Uncertainty Principle mixup, what about the other two concepts? The biggest problem in physics today is the lack of unification between the noisy quantum mechanics on the subatomic scale and the ordered patterns of general relativity. String theory and the very popular but nearly impossible to test many worlds theory tries to explain the effects of the basic forces that shape the universe on all scales in terms of different dimensions or leaks from other universes. So when Tallis says that it’s still 40 years and we don’t know which one is right, then piles on his misunderstanding of quantum mechanics on top of Wallace’s seeming inability to tell the difference between multiverses and string theory, he ends up with the mess above. We get a paradox where there isn’t one and scope creep from particle physics into cosmology. Not quite a ringing endorsement of philosophy in physics so far. And then Tallis makes it worse…</p>
<blockquote><p>The attempt to fit consciousness into the material world, usually by identifying it with activity in the brain, has failed dismally, if only because there is no way of accounting for the fact that certain nerve impulses are supposed to be conscious (of themselves or of the world) while the overwhelming majority (physically essentially the same) are not. In short, physics does not allow for the strange fact that matter reveals itself to material objects (such as physicists).</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, a grab bag of not even wrong is supposed to sell us on the idea that a philosopher could help where our tools are pushed to their limits. Considering that Tallis <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/12/14/the-curious-case-of-a-skeptical-bait-and-switch/\">dismisses the entire idea that neuroscience as a discipline has any merit</a>, no wonder that he proclaims that we don’t have any clue of what consciousness is from a biological perspective. The fact is that we do have lots of clues. Certain patterns of brain activity are strongly associated with a person being aware of his or her environment, being able to meaningfully interact, and store and recall information as needed. It’s hardly the full picture of course, but it’s a lot more than Tallis thinks it is. His bizarre claim that scientists consider some nerve pulses to be conscious while the majority are said not to be is downright asinine. Just about every paper on the study of the conscious mind in a peer reviewed, high quality journal refer to consciousness as a product of the entire brain. </p>
<p>The rest of his argument is just a meaningless, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism\" target=\"_blank\">vitalist</a> word salad. If brain activity is irrelevant to consciousness, why do healthy living people have certain paterns while those who had massive brain injuries have different ones depending on the site of injury? Why do all those basic brain wave patterns repeat again and again in test after test? Just for the fun of seeing themselves on an EEG machine’s output? And what does it mean that it’s a surprising fact that we can perceive matter around us? Once again, hardly a serious testament to the usefulness of philosophers in science because so far all we got is meaningless questions accusing scientists of being unable to solve problems that aren’t problems by using a couple of buzzwords incorrectly, haphazardly cobbling bits of pieces of different theories into an overreaching statement that initially sounds well researched, but means pretty much nothing. Well, this is at least when we don’t have Tallis outright dismissing the science without explaining what’s wrong with it…</p>
<blockquote><p>Recent attempts to explain how the universe came out of nothing, which rely on questionable notions such as spontaneous fluctuations in a quantum vacuum, the notion of gravity as negative energy, and the inexplicable free gift of the laws of nature waiting in the wings for the moment of creation, reveal conceptual confusion beneath mathematical sophistication.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we get a double whammy of Tallis getting the science wrong and deciding that he doesn’t like the existing ideas because they don’t pass his smell test. He’s combining competing ideas to declare them inconsistent within a unified framework, seeingly unaware that the hypotheses he’s ridiculing aren’t complimentary by design. Yes, we don’t know how the universe was created, all we have <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/01/20/an-appeasement-of-cosmic-proportions/\">is evidence of the Big Bang</a> and we want to know exactly what banged and how. This is why we have competing theories about quantum fluxes, virtual particles, branes, <a href=\"http://\">and all sorts of other mathematical ideas created in a giant brainstorm</a>, waiting to be tested for any hint of a real application to observable phenomena. Pop sci magazines might declare that math proved that a stray quantum particle caused the Big Bang or that we were all vomited out by some giant black hole, or <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/07/18/mining-physics-for-grounbreaking-papers/\">are living in the event horizon of one</a>, but in reality, that math is just one idea. So yes, Tallis is right about the confusion under the algebra, but he’s wrong about why it exists.</p>
<p>And here’s the bottom line. If the philosopher trying to make the case for this profession’s need for inclusion into the realms of physics and neuroscience doesn’t understand what the problems are, what the fields do, and how the fields work, why would we even want to hear how he could help? If you read his entire column, he never does explain how, but really, after all his whoppers and not even wrongs, do you care? Philosophers are useful when you want to define a process or wrap your head around where to start your research on a complex topic, like how to create an artificial intelligence. But past that, hard numbers and experiments are required to figure out the truth, otherwise, all we have are debates about semantics which at some point may well turn into questions of what it means to exist in the first place. Not to say that this last part is not a debate worth having, but it doesn’t add much to a field where we can actually measure and calculate a real answer to a real question and apply what we learn to dive even further.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F29%2Fwhy-scientists-really-dont-need-the-input-of-philosophers-like-raymond-tallis%2F&title=why%20scientists%20really%20don%E2%80%99t%20need%20the%20input%20of%20philosophers%20like%20raymond%20tallis\" id=\"wpa2a_20\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/29/why-scientists-really-dont-need-the-input-of-philosophers-like-raymond-tallis/#comments" "5af63898e30cf22125639a0b4ebbb0eb") (50 (20949 25781 810202) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/28/why-the-new-star-trek-was-doomed-to-trekkie-hatred/" "why the new star trek was doomed to trekkie hatred" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 28 May 2013 22:28:57 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/enterprise_vs_dreadnaught_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"enterprise vs. dreadnought\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16728\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>A good swath of the geek part of the internet is lit up with fury about Star Trek Into Darkness. It’s manifested on the familiar nerd hubs like <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/05/star-trek-into-darkness-carol-marcus/\" target=\"_blank\">Wired</a>, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/star-trek-into-darkness-impressive-but-imperfect/\" target=\"_blank\">Ars</a>, and <a href=\"http://io9.com/star-trek-into-darkness-the-spoiler-faq-508927844\" target=\"_blank\">io9</a>, especially io9, which is downright incandescent with rage about the movie’s choice of villain. Numerous calls have been made for the heads of J.J. Abrams and his crew on platters, to soothe the angry Gods of Trek, while fans of the franchise are busy offering ideas for what would’ve made the movie better, which, surprise surprise, involve following the canon of the original series and the spin-offs. But this was a given when you consider the source material and the fan base. You can’t reboot a franchise simply by continuing the story arcs already decades in the making, you can’t make an exciting movie that focuses on tedious exopolitical negotiations in the neutral zone, and you will ruffle some feathers when you try to boldly go (or go at all) where the franchise has never gone before.</p>
<p>For example, one of the big complaints about Abrams’ vision of Star Trek is the militarization of the Federation’s fleet. But here’s the thing. It’s a fleet of spaceships that might face adversarial life forms (like the Romulans and Klingons), the ships are armed with lasers and missiles, and a botched first encounter can turn a peaceful delegation of explorers into a military incursion. So it’s kind of hard to blame Abrams for seeing the potential of the Federation to wage war, and in dire circumstances, use ships that were once meant to explore the galaxy for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_projection\" target=\"_blank\">force projection</a>, as the Enterprise is used in Into Darkness. And of course there’s the commercial consideration. A sci-fi movie sells best when there’s war involved because that makes a good popcorn flick that’s going to attract big crowds. People generally struggle with peaceful meditations on life from all those little green men, and often don’t try to apply it back to the world they inhabit.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, Star Trek was supposed to rise above these commercial considerations but today, sci-fi is a hard sell. For studios, it’s either popcorn munching military science fiction or another rom-com because they’re a business and movies are expensive to make, especially those which require lots and lots of special effects. If you’re a die-hard Trekkie, you’re going to have to make some concessions to people who live outside your bubble and really couldn’t care about all the intricate stories to which you dedicated countless hours. Who knows, they might like the idea so much, they go back and rediscover what you saw in the source material. But if you’re going for mass audiences, something has to give and compromises have to be made. And here is where we run into the biggest complaint of them all, that Abrams was recycling deep material from the original rather than creating something completely new out of it. Unfortunately, this is an area in which every reboot director is facing a lose-lose proposition by the nature of the project.</p>
<p>Had Into Darkness essentially been an updated Wrath of Khan, Abrams would’ve been pilloried for simply giving the classic a coat of fresh paint, just like io9 was savaging him for using classic material and inverting it, with the writer sounding nearly apoplectic with fan rage. If the movie’s plot resembled nothing ever seen or done on Star Trek, the Trekkies would’ve been infuriated that they got their Star Trek without anything that made it like Star Trek, asking why Abrams did not make and references to the original and just borrowed the names, ships, and logos to make something completely different under the same brand name. That’s the nature of a reboot. You won’t be able to please the fans either way unless you simply continue where the last episode of their franchise left off without missing a beat, and that sort of defeats the whole idea of a reboot in the first place. Into Darkness was a fun movie, it had its moments, and it was technically very, very well executed for what it was supposed to be. And at least it has people interested in sci-fi, which is more than we could say for many past and upcoming sci-fi flicks…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F28%2Fwhy-the-new-star-trek-was-doomed-to-trekkie-hatred%2F&title=why%20the%20new%20star%20trek%20was%20doomed%20to%20trekkie%20hatred\" id=\"wpa2a_22\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/28/why-the-new-star-trek-was-doomed-to-trekkie-hatred/#comments" "a98016d1d755b6f06bb3f1ddb1336899") (49 (20949 25781 809043) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/18/from-virtual-reality-pioneer-to-anti-singularitarian/" "from virtual reality pioneer to anti-singularitarian" "Greg Fish" "Sat, 18 May 2013 14:21:19 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/future_dystopia_600.jpg?resize=600%2C330\" alt=\"future dystopia\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16723\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>This is not the first time Jaron Lanier gets a post on Weird Things, in fact we met him before as he quickly <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/08/11/when-philosophy-meets-artificial-intelligence/\">went off the rails in describing AI</a>, then became more incoherent <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/08/31/jaron-lanier-vs-history-and-the-singularitarians/\">while bemoaning all social media as a dehumanizing waste</a>, all the while trying to pick a fight with the Singularitarian version of a machine-directed utopia. Now, the former virtual reality pioneer has <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/book-review-who-owns-the-future-7000015123/\" target=\"_blank\">moved on to a book length rumination on how technology is killing the middle class</a> by eliminating jobs. And as per his current modus operandi, he starts off with a tiny kernel of a reasonable statement, and proceeds to strap it to the Hyperbole Rocket and launch it into deep space. Is it true that a new software package or a robot might make your job obsolete? Yes, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/02/24/how-do-you-future-proof-your-job-prospects/\">it absolutely can</a>. But does the technology prevent you from getting a new job? No, it doesn’t because the reasons why you’re going to have trouble finding work in a globalized economy <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/11/01/robots-just-might-take-your-job-and-keep-it/\">are more political than technological</a>, and it’s short term greed, partisan bickering, and ignorance of the powers that be at fault.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Lanier’s opening salvo says that when Kodak was at the height of its market domination of personal photography, it employed more than 140,000 people. Now, he says, the face of personal photography is Instagram which has only 13 employees. Therefore, jobs were lost because of technology, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.\" target=\"_blank\">Q.E.D.</a> Um, no. First and foremost, Kodak died the slow and painful death it did because it first refused to adapt to a world of digital photography, then couldn’t, as it wasted years assuming that as long as they can at least sell the tools to develop all those digital photos on glossy paper, they’ll be fine. They never even thought that paper may be useless for most of the pictures being taken today as social media and smartphones took off. Secondly, as much as tech blogs may have hyped it, Instagram was not \"the new face of photography.\" Take away cheap, mainstream digital photography and it couldn’t exist. It was a distribution network, a network that Kodak could’ve built. But instead of innovating, it slowly withered away.</p>
<p>All right, so what happened to those tens of thousands of people laid off by Kodak? Well, they could find new jobs because among those laid off were managers, assistants, chemists, and IT specialists who could’ve applied their skills in other companies, doing other things, and I assure you that there aren’t 140,000 middle class workers out there who haven’t worked a day since a Kodak executive pink slipped them to meet the quarterly numbers. Eeyore would’ve been more optimistic about their future than Lanier, but then again, for optimism, Lanier would’ve needed to see technology as something more than a nefarious tool to use and abuse the populace. Where the disciples of Ray Kurzweil <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2011/02/15/techno-utopianism-makes-it-to-time-magazine/\">see immorality, sunshine  rainbows, and unicorns</a> frolicking in the meadows, he seems to see impending chaos, destruction, and socioeconomic dystopia adapted from the pages of very gloomy science fiction. And yet, Lanier plans to live with this grim future. For a fee of course. You see, in his version of if-you-can’t-beat-them-join-them, he’s suggesting that if social media sites use our data to survive, they should pay us for it, and that’s how we will start solving the impending job crisis caused by these evil machines taking our place.</p>
<p>Certainly, while being paid to mess around on Facebook would be a great deal, the problem is that paying all of its users even pennies a day would leave the company insolvent. Social media sites simply don’t make all that much money because <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/10/06/so-how-is-that-social-web-working-out-for-facebook/\">they fell short of the promises they give a lot of advertisers</a> when it comes to moving product for them. All the data you submit simply won’t give them nearly as good of a picture of who you are and what you like as Lanier and so many tech pundits think it does when they fall for the company’s wild claims. In fact, predicting what a person will do based on his or her social media footprint <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/09/02/trying-to-predict-the-future-one-stat-at-a-time/\">is an exercise in warm reading</a>. There’s plenty of detail to go on, but a lot of this detail may be useless and lead to broad conclusions or incorrect recommendations. Advertisers are not moving nearly as much product as they thought they would, people are giving them incomplete and misleading information, social media makes money but not as much as it thought it could, and now Lanier wants this struggling ecosystem to pay its users for making it profitably mediocre? Does he also have a bridge to sell us?</p>
<p>Yes, the world is changing. Yes, technology is doing things it’s never done before, and it’s now taking us places where we’ve never been, physically, socially, and economically. But instead of trying to figure out a way to productively deal with with the change of pace, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/09/05/waiting-for-the-corporate-messiahs-to-save-us/\">by investing in R&D and shifting more jobs into innovation and design</a>, while letting robots do more of the execution, people like Lanier want to take their ball and go home. The problem is that they can’t. Arguing if our sprawling data centers and powerful software needs to be scaled back and dumbed down is like protesting against the wind blowing. You can waste your oxygen telling it to slow down or go in a direction you’d personally find more acceptable, or you can raise some wind generators for an extra kilowatt hour or two to take advantage of the situation. At no point has any civilization ever grown or met a challenge by saying \"no, we’re done,\" or demanding payment to participate in new ideas, new economies, and new social structures. Many have died and stagnated doing exactly that, which is why we shouldn’t take Lanier’s technophobic musings seriously.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F18%2Ffrom-virtual-reality-pioneer-to-anti-singularitarian%2F&title=from%20virtual%20reality%20pioneer%20to%20anti-singularitarian\" id=\"wpa2a_24\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/18/from-virtual-reality-pioneer-to-anti-singularitarian/#comments" "d3ef0034eab65ee44eb87b1775eb3e47") (48 (20949 25781 807691) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/16/psychologists-convenience-samples-and-really-shoddy-popular-science-writing/" "psychologists, convenience samples, and really shoddy popular science writing" "Greg Fish" "Thu, 16 May 2013 20:50:20 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/exposed_brain_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"exposed brain\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16717\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Psychology has occasionally been called \"the study of college undergraduates\" and while that would usually be a joke in the psych department, a few writers are raising red flags that it’s too common of a practice <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/05/weird_psychology_social_science_researchers_rely_too_much_on_western_college.single.html\" traget=\"_blank\">and might be affecting the quality of the science</a>. The study they chose to highlight? A survey trying to make the link between someone’s first sexual experience and what sexual activity follows based on 319 heterosexual college students who started having sex only about two years prior to the study and were asked to describe their intimate activities with some very positive and some very negative adjectives from a proscribed list. While the critics ask why the population was so homogeneous and the responses were so limited, this actually makes a lot of sense. If you’re not sure of your hypothesis, you want to have the most uniform samples you can find and limit inherently qualitative feedback into more quantitative form. From there on, you can test if the theory holds for more sexually experienced and diverse populations. So why are science writers harping on a perfectly legitimate, well done hypothesis fishing study?</p>
<p>Probably because it’s recent and it found that the students’ first sexual experience tended to be indicative of how they’d describe their future ones. And when limited to the population studied, it does make sense. Many of them are still relatively wet behind the ears and having finally had a real sexual encounter, they’re wondering what others will be like and comparing it to their first as they get more and more experience because it’s usually one of their few points of reference. At the same time, however, as the first experience fades into memory, new highlights come to take its place and a terrible first time gets forgotten in favor of the last mind-blowing experience and that might go on to color future encounters. We could also wonder about couples who lost their virginity to each other and haven’t had sex with anyone else. So why didn’t the researchers take cases like this into account? Well, they’d be outside the scope of the study, which basically just points out the obvious that yes, there’s a mental link between what you thought of your first time and your future preferences and expectations, as it applies to the sample population.</p>
<p>And that last phrase is really the crux of the matter because while human sexuality is so diverse and complex that questions about it could easily fuel centuries of studies and experiments, the pool of people willing to be studied is limited and the external factors they’d bring into the study makes it complicated to tease out complex and minute differences that might hint at something more, something that merits further research. College undergraduates are easy to recruit, easy to find close to the researchers’ labs, and fairly easy to homogenize, so they make for a simple, convenient set of test subjects in pilot studies. They’re a classic go-to convenience sample, and if you want to study special populations, you’ll go and study those special populations when you have the resources to do so. It’s just not fair to expect a narrow study to account for everything and use it a s springboard to pontificate on the limited utility of convenience sampling in basic psychology published for the public. And here the media has to take some heat as well.</p>
<p>How many pop sci writers just copy and paste the press release? How many of them wrote click bait headlines that sound as if an exhaustive study settled the question of just how special your first time is to you and what role it plays in your sex life? And how many of them trying their best to be contrarians put words in the researchers’ mouths and criticized them for making claims not actually made by the study? My guess? Quite a few. In fact, the links to a critical review of three other studies in the referenced critique were papers uncritically hyped by the media to become the viral stories they became. We can certainly argue about how much psychologists are relying on convenience samples of white, college educated students in the West, and what this does to the field as a whole. However, if the initial studies seem to be suffering from a bad sample or are way too limited to be applied outside of a very narrow socioeconomic group, the media klaxon is making the problem a hundred times worse. For writers to then wag their finger at the scientists, saying \"tsk, tsk on your sampling techniques\" without acknowledging that their colleagues have been running away with inconclusive and narrow studies for years is very disingenuous.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F16%2Fpsychologists-convenience-samples-and-really-shoddy-popular-science-writing%2F&title=psychologists%2C%20convenience%20samples%2C%20and%20really%20shoddy%20popular%20science%20writing\" id=\"wpa2a_26\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/16/psychologists-convenience-samples-and-really-shoddy-popular-science-writing/#comments" "364a89633f673db7e6d27cf0d526d9cd") (47 (20949 25781 804818) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/13/conspiracy-writers-rediscover-the-cias-sex-slaves/" "conspiracy writers rediscover the =?utf-8?Q?cia=E2=80=99s?= sex slaves" "Greg Fish" "Mon, 13 May 2013 21:42:25 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/barefoot_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"barefoot\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16142\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Conspiracy theories about mind control are nothing new. In fact, I’ve lost count how many books from Jim Marrs and David Icke purport some sort of mind control beam, or wave, or program by the nefarious Illuminati altering our consciousness so we become mere puppets to the will of an evil intelligence. And considering how many of them are out there, they’re getting harder to sell, even to an audience primed to hear more stories about sinister mind control experiments which sound pulled right form the pages of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illuminatus!_Trilogy\" target=\"_blank\">Illuminatus! Trilogy</a>, so if you’re a conspiracy theorist with a book to sell, you have to spice it up somehow, and sex slavery seems to be emerging as the new trend in getting people’s attention. A good example is <a href=\"http://www.theconspiracyreview.com/1/post/2013/04/mind-controlled-sex-slaves-and-the-cia.html\" target=\"_blank\">a new book from the Conspiracy Journal</a> which builds itself on the story of Cathy O’Brien, a woman who claimed that she was a victim of the CIA’s more sinister MKULTRA subproject codenamed Monarch in a Satanic Panic era potboiler called Trance Formation of America. Yes dear readers, sex can sell anything…</p>
<p>Now, where do we begin? When you open <a href=\"http://ia600502.us.archive.org/10/items/TranceformationOfAmerica/tranceformation_america.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">an online version</a> of O’Brien’s book, you’ll be quickly hammered by countless attempts to prove that a) mind control exists, b) no one talks about it to hide how effective it is from you, thus engaging in a form of mind control, and c) because there are reams of paperwork showing that the CIA experimented with mind control, it means we have to believe O’Brien and her stories of CIA sex slaves created for the pleasure of malevolent big wigs whose cooperation America wanted to secure during the Cold War. Oy. Here’s the problem in this line of reasoning. The kernel of truth here is that the CIA did attempt to experiment with all sorts of mind control ideas to teach its spies, but just about all of them were spectacular failures so one of the big reasons why so many were kept hush hush is because they flatly didn’t work and the agency didn’t want anyone to know how badly they were struggling with anything other than drugging a person and very unevenly interrogating him or her in an intoxicated state.</p>
<p>But instead of showing how mind control can work, O’Brien simply claims that absence of a well understood or recognized form of mind control means that it must exist, then goes on to equate tightly controlled state propaganda with mind control. That doesn’t really work. Mind control has the connotation that there’s a device, or a chemical cocktail that will make you do the bidding of whoever has it. Propaganda is basically brainwashing through tight control of information. That’s not the same thing, and it relies on a totalitarian regime that could control everything its citizens see and hear, a regime like North Korea. And even there the total control breaks down when an errant signal gets picked up on the radio or an outlawed internet connection is established that lets the regime’s prisoner-citizens see into the outside world. Having lived in a real authoritarian state, I can tell you that America today is far too permissive to exercise that kind of “mind control by disinformation,” unless you can prove that the entire Western world is being brainwashed, a claim that requires a very significant burden of proof and for some political miracles to occur.</p>
<p>And this is where the <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/01/08/the-bizarre-mindset-of-conspiracy-theorists/\">mind controlled CIA/Illuminati/Builderberg sex slaves</a> come in. They are the reward for those rich, famous, and powerful enough to advance the New World Order’s agenda, though one wonders since when the rich and powerful, for whom money is no object, became so easily bribed with sex. They can easily charm or buy their way into women’s panties as shown by countless scandals of exactly that happening. Even more bizarre to me is that stories of female sexual slaves are plentiful while virtually nothing exists on male sex slaves. This doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Surely a global network of thousands of power players must feature straight women with an appetite for lithe young men, or homosexual fatcats. So why do we hear nothing at all about them? Of course there’s more. O’Brien’s vivid recollections of abuse at the hands of all sorts of foreign diplomats, power brokers, and Satanic cultists — oh we’ll be back to that, don’t you worry for a second that we won’t — came to her through hypnosis, like the memories of alien abductees though a process we’ve seen before, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/06/22/a-comprehensive-look-at-alien-abductions/\">a process which has no scientific basis</a>.</p>
<p>So in the end, what we have is a mix of Satanic Panic ritual sexual abuse, misuse of hypnosis on highly suggestible subjects, and conspiracy theories borrowing from <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2008/10/09/new-world-order-old-world-news/\">the Taxil Hoax</a>. And that’s a perfect mix in the 1990s, when the tabloids are on fire with the idea of Satanic subliminal music, and wild claims of countless children being tortured and future Miss Teen Americas raped in the catacombs of cultists acting on behalf of the Devil, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/09/13/weekend-satanists-for-jesus/\">and greedy con men are writing confessions of their supposed guilt in the nasty undertaking</a>. Isn’t it odd that O’Brien’s tale fits just oh so very perfectly with the predominant money making conspiracy literature of the time, literature quickly shown to be either untrustworthy or outright made up and sold as real accounts? And shouldn’t we wonder why perfectly these calibrated salacious rumors and supposed real tales of power, sex, magic, and aliens should be trusted when they’re repackaged to sell to us a second time, a few decades after they were last popular? Human trafficking like the type shown in Taken is bad enough without money-making boogeymen like the Repotoids, CIA, and the Illuminati. Maybe we should keep them out of a very real and very dire problem? Just a thought…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F13%2Fconspiracy-writers-rediscover-the-cias-sex-slaves%2F&title=conspiracy%20writers%20rediscover%20the%20cia%E2%80%99s%20sex%20slaves\" id=\"wpa2a_28\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/13/conspiracy-writers-rediscover-the-cias-sex-slaves/#comments" "82ec49b94a9211cf1227f601cd3a4fb5") (46 (20949 25781 803525) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/07/when-you-measure-for-the-sake-of-measuring/" "when you measure for the sake of measuring" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 07 May 2013 21:52:38 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/counting_the_days_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"counting the days\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16707\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>One of Warren Buffet’s most famous pieces of advice to analytic managers is to measure the things that matter, not just the things that are measurable. It’s a lesson lost on Chris Dancy, the IT professional whose claim to fame <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/02/quantified-work/all/\" target=\"_blank\">is measuring every second of his workday</a>. Every second. I meant it. Every call, meeting, bathroom break, document edit, e-mail reply, and work tweet has a special color coded entry in Google Calendar so his bosses will know exactly what he was doing at 1:13 PM last Tuesday and appreciate his ability to document every moment at the office. Just one thing is left out on his mind-bendingly detailed calendars — how much time he wastes on his pointless endeavor. Seriously, if your boss read that post and thinks this is a good idea, I would highly suggest firing up your resume and passing it along to some good friends because you’re working for someone who doesn’t want to manage employees, you’re working for someone who wants to manage robots and look at dashboards to make pretty reports for executives.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Factory work can be easily measured in terms of how much time is spent on a part, how much time is idle, how many widgets are out the door each day, and other very hard metrics that can track how a factory lives and breathes. Service oriented positions like IT have a lot of soft elements to them. Whereas parts have to be manufactured to exact specifications, an important code block can be written in many ways. Sending a 1,000 sprockets to quality control by the end of the day means meeting several orders on schedule. Sending 44 tweets about the newest app throughout the day might mean a few sales, or might mean nothing at all. You get a lot of numbers that don’t actually mean anything by using Dancy’s methodology. Yeah, he goes to a lot of meetings and does a lot of IT paperwork. So what? How many times did he have to do it again because it didn’t provide enough detail to developers? How would the developers rate it and would they rather have someone else do it next time? How thorough was his testing?</p>
<p>If you want decent metrics from your IT department, you have to look at quality of what it sends out to be used. How many people like the products? How many would recommend them to their friends? How much are they willing to pay for them? How many units were sold? What was the overall return on investment and how did the expenses break down overall (labor vs. tools)? Or what’s the turnaround time for fixing a defect? How many defects did internal QA workers catch versus how many were reported by users after shipping? Those are important metrics and they should matter a lot more to IT management than how many times someone like Darcy had to go to the bathroom or how many pages of documents he or she wrote that day. So the idea that if some aspect of your day can be measured it should be, and your bosses will appreciate you just going right ahead and measuring it for them, is absurd to put it gently. Ultimately what matters is what you produce so even if you’re extremely busy and making the most of out your day, if you produce nothing really useful, none of your intricate daily calendars will save you from the HR’s chopping block, and don’t you dare blame that on not measuring your day enough.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F07%2Fwhen-you-measure-for-the-sake-of-measuring%2F&title=when%20you%20measure%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20measuring\" id=\"wpa2a_30\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/07/when-you-measure-for-the-sake-of-measuring/#comments" "2a675886251c10717641b62ed9414daa") (45 (20949 25781 800949) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/04/yes-sometimes-its-good-to-write-for-free/" "yes, sometimes =?utf-8?Q?it=E2=80=99s?= good to write for free" "Greg Fish" "Sat, 04 May 2013 14:43:00 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/old_typewriter_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"old typewriter\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16702\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>In March, freelance journalist Nate Thayer is incandescent with rage. It wasn’t that he’s trying to make his living by writing and no one’s paying attention. In fact The Atlantic is knocking on his door and asking to run condensed versions of one of his blog posts. No, the big problem <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/nate-thayer-vs-the-atlantic-writing-for-free.html\" target=\"_blank\">is that they were not offering to pay him for it</a>, and their once upon a time talks of a $125,000 per year retainer never really came to anything because the editor working on it was killed in Iraq. Thayer was livid, saying that he can’t feed his kids, can’t pay for his internet connection, and can barely pay his rent, so how dare the publication offer him nothing but exposure. Maybe it was wise that he didn’t take the deal because it would’ve made <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/nate-thayer-atlantic-charged-with-plagiarism.html\" target=\"_blank\">the charges of partial plagiarism for the post</a> in question all the more embarrassing. But charges and controversies aside, when I came across a reference to Thayer’s debacle, I thought it would be a good idea to highlight what this incident shows about new vs. old media and why journalists will find themselves fewer in number.</p>
<p>Here’s the important thing about selling your services. Just because you need to make a certain amount of money to pay rent, doesn’t mean that what you’re trying to sell is worth that much to the entity interested in buying. Professional journalists who worked back when there weren’t any blogs around to break news, and newspapers were arbiters of what was must-read, are used to being able to take their time, work on a story, and get paid good money for their efforts. But this wonderful world of overseas posts, expense accounts, and large retainers is now gone. People like the immediacy of breaking news through social media and TV, and then in depth summaries and investigations as the situation settles down. And they get this from virtually everywhere free because anyone can break stories. The result? News is cheap. So how will The Atlantic cover a six figure retainer for someone producing stories that aren’t necessarily that valuable and won’t generate enough traffic to pay for themselves at such sky high rates?</p>
<p>On top of that, exposure is a good thing. I’ve had one of my posts reproduced by io9, of course with my permission. It gave the blog more credibility and more traffic, which helped a syndication deal I had at the time because the payouts were based on the number of readers. Being picked up by Time Warner’s news sites was also a huge boon, and although few of the publications for which I’ve written sent me cold, hard cash, the traffic and exposure for my work made this blog turn a profit. At no time was I laboring under the delusion that I was going to make six figures for my pop sci writing because pop sci articles are a dime a dozen. The web is positively lousy with them. The money from the blog was simply a way to help with rent while doing some freelance IT work and if it became something more, great. For Thayer to expect anything more out of a blog nowadays is simply unrealistic, and his fury at being offered free exposure sounds really out of touch. If his kids are going hungry and his rent is going unpaid, he needs to find another way to make money because let me tell you from experience, this writing stuff doesn’t pay well.</p>
<p>That said, there will always be some room for investigative journalists and researchers who will curate what’s circling around social media, track down sources, and find out real stories, but it’s unlikely that they won’t rely on the traffic their stories generate for their salaries and donations from readers who want them to keep going and appreciate the time it takes to create a massive, long form expose. But again, their stories better be gripping, fascinating, and start debates on a national scale. An abbreviated review of North Korea policy doesn’t necessarily fit that bill while parsing leaked information about top secret drone strikes does. The future of journalism is very savvy writers who act as their own editors and work in partnership with publications, not as their employees, focused not just on their stories but the economics of their storytelling. If former big shot journalists like Thayer don’t know that, they really need to wake up and smell the coffee as they read through the Twitter feed, looking for material for their next post…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F04%2Fyes-sometimes-its-good-to-write-for-free%2F&title=yes%2C%20sometimes%20it%E2%80%99s%20good%20to%20write%20for%20free\" id=\"wpa2a_32\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/04/yes-sometimes-its-good-to-write-for-free/#comments" "e3f172f0120bdaf916307064510f4188") (44 (20949 25781 799828) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/30/why-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science/" "why we need to keep politicians away from science" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 21:21:43 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/microcosm_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"microcosm\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15760\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Really, the politicians in office today, science, and technology simply don’t mix. We have years and years of bills and their behavior proving this. From <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/08/31/the-peter-principle-stacks-the-deck-against-science/\">vapid remarks about science</a>, to serious debate about <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/06/19/cyber-security-youre-doing-it-very-wrong/\">an internet kill switch</a>, to <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/05/15/how-we-shouldnt-fix-research-grant-problems/\">inviting woefully unqualified people to judge what should be funded by the NSF</a>, it’s as if our lawmakers are trying to live <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/02/14/calling-all-boss-haters/\">the stereotype of over-confident managers who think they’re experts at all things because they can talk a big game</a>. It would be amusing were they not in a position to actually change how science is being funded, and churn out ridiculous proposal after ridiculous proposal. The latest volley of this oblivious ineptitude is the bill from Lamar Smith (yes, R-TX, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/05/18/the-state-of-texas-vs-science-and-education/\">a real shocker</a>, I know) which lays out <a href=\"http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2013/04/us-lawmaker-proposes-new-criteri-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">what sort of projects the NSF should be funding</a> and in the process basically discards anything that’s not an applied military or a medical project, negating the entire point of basic research and eviscerating basic research funding not obfuscated to look like a future treatment, weapon, or infosec system.</p>
<p>Basic science is done because we’re curious about something and we don’t know what sorts of applications or spin-offs it might have. Maybe there will be none. Maybe we’ll discover something as incredibly useful as lasers. Maybe there will be no direct benefit but in the process, we’ll build something that will change the world, like the world wide web being derived from a project meant to help particle physicists share data from particle collider results at CERN. We just don’t know, which is why we try to study all these things, and the results provide more than enough ROI as direct applications and spin-offs are commercialized. However, a lot of people will not see it that way, insisting that if something can’t be on the market within a few years, or used to kill bad guys half a world away, it’s a waste of money. And not only do they see it that way, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/03/10/why-so-many-said-that-apollo-wasnt-worth-it/\">they refuse to even try to understand how basic research and the scientific process work</a>. They also <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/02/23/why-scientists-wont-be-elected-in-the-u-s/\">do not care for, or understand scientists</a>, deluding themselves with myths about their lifestyles.</p>
<p>And this is how we get the Lamar Smiths of the world. His constituents truly believe that a typical scientist could never make it in \"a real job,\" and lives off of government welfare in the form of an enormous grant, handed over like a blank check from the NSF. The facts that scientists actually make something like $55,000 per year on average, have to deal with the NSF approving only a small fraction of all the grant applications they receive (below 10% in many fields and up to 20% in some others), and generally to already well established scientists, and that they can be fired for not being top of their field, do not register with them. It’s so sadly ironic that people who can easily out-earn scientists in their lifetimes and can keep their jobs if they’re at least mediocre, are deriding woefully underpaid professionals who can be fired for not being in the top 10% of their discipline and have to pay their own salaries through fundraising and political savvy. And it’s an insult to injury when said people turn scientifically illiterate politicians into their attack dogs.</p>
<p>But this is what happens when people are allowed, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2011/04/03/yes-education-is-good-for-you-stop-whining/\">and even encouraged</a>, to remain glib and as incurious as they please by politicians and public figures who rush to pat them on the back and give them a gold star for just being who they are. The current push to structure basic education around standardized testing rather than discovery, curiosity, and career orientation isn’t helping either. If we just let kids find out what fascinates them and feed their curiosity with key subjects that will let them pursue it further, they’ll learn the reading, the math, and the history involved to perform well on whatever standardized tests you’ll give them. After all, any field requires a solid command of basic literacy and mathematical competence to fully understand. But that requires the effort to restructure how the education system works, basically, giving a shit and trying to do something about it, to put it bluntly. However, by the choices a lot of people are making in their elected officials, and their support of said officials’ scientific illiteracy and hostility to science, I’m willing to bet that not a whole lot of the required shits are being given on average…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F04%2F30%2Fwhy-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science%2F&title=why%20we%20need%20to%20keep%20politicians%20away%20from%20science\" id=\"wpa2a_34\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/30/why-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science/#comments" "e701023c799db08491b2307ad5bcee8b") (43 (20949 25781 796937) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/26/why-colonizing-another-planet-really-shouldnt-be-a-reality-show/" "why colonizing another planet really =?utf-8?Q?shouldn=E2=80=99t?= be a reality show" "Greg Fish" "Fri, 26 Apr 2013 13:36:30 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mars_one_habitat_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"mars one habitat\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16691\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>The Mars One project generated a good deal of media attention by promising to fund its efforts to colonize the Red Planet with a reality show which would follow the crews on their one way trip and chronicle their efforts at living on another world. Now while this sounds like the most far out premise for the next season of Survivor, it’s a terrible idea for an actual mission. If you’ve ever seen a reality show, you know that producers don’t really cast people as much as they cast the stereotypes they think will give viewers the most bang for their buck. If Gordon Ramsey didn’t go on epic tirades over every dish not up to his par, slamming trays, punching the food, and having fits of apoplectic rage that would put a banshee to shame, you’d be left with a fairly boring hour of TV that would be more at home at the Food Network than on a broadcast channel. Could you imagine Hell’s Spacecraft as a real mission to extend human cities to a new planet?</p>
<p>And that’s not even getting to the fact that Mars One is asking anyone to apply for what should be a mission for extremely well trained professionals with numerous actual space flights on their resumes, and <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/applications-open-for-mars-one-the-first-human-space-colony/\" target=\"_blank\">charging as much as $38</a> just to look at an application, and that it will rely on new rockets built by SpaceX to do the actual work, as well as the fact that it’s spending no time at all trying to address <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/03/02/why-a-flyby-of-mars-may-not-live-up-to-its-intention/\">all the problems with flying to Mars in capsules</a>? At the end of the day this has to be either a scam, or just a really terrible idea that will never pan out. Make no mistake, I’m not saying that we shouldn’t try to colonize Mars or that we can’t pull it off if we really devoted plenty of time, energy, and resources to it. We absolutely should and we’re probably very close to the place we need to be to safely and comfortably send crews to the Red Planet. But making reality shows out of it, raising money by promising one way trips to alien worlds, and relying on brand new technology not really meant or tested for these missions is not the way to go about it.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F04%2F26%2Fwhy-colonizing-another-planet-really-shouldnt-be-a-reality-show%2F&title=why%20colonizing%20another%20planet%20really%20shouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20a%20reality%20show\" id=\"wpa2a_36\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/26/why-colonizing-another-planet-really-shouldnt-be-a-reality-show/#comments" "131809690f3261ea46cbf449f8a2813f") (42 (20949 25781 796070) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/25/how-to-shield-yourself-in-a-vacuum-sci-fi-style/" "how to shield yourself in a vacuum, sci-fi style" "Greg Fish" "Thu, 25 Apr 2013 20:28:17 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/alien_bacteria_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"alien bacteria\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16225\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>In a fair bit of science fiction, we see advanced alien species use some sort of shielding to walk around other planets or survive being ejected into space. Something around them flickers and a protective invisible bubble is raised, protecting them from a horrible death by dehydration as all the fluid in their bodies effectively boils away. As it turns out, that’s actually possible. So far it’s only been done with fruit fly and mosquito larvae, but we apparently know how to create a shield from extreme conditions, capturing water and necessary gases trapped in a field of electrons or plasma. All you have to do is take a specimen into an electron scanning microscope and send a shower of electrons or a plasma beam at your target. The electrons and ions envelop the living specimen, creating a little, almost skin-tight biodome that contains just enough air for it to move and otherwise keep very obviously living for about an hour. So, you might ask, electromagnetic spacesuits for everybody? Well, no, not exactly. There are a few really important caveats.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the specimens are being irradiated, and the more powerful the shielding has to be, the more radiation it requires to organize itself. Humans could get radiation poisoning as their suits are being beamed onto them, or at least risk extremly dangerous exposure levels. But if you think a little cancer is worth it, there’s the issue of being trapped with your air supply. With no scrubbers, your respiration would produce dangerous level of carbon dioxide and you would die of hypoxia after about 45 minutes to an hour or so, depending, of course, on your breathing and how much of an air supply you initially had. And now might be a good time to mention that a spacesuit created by nothing but charged particles wasn’t the original goal of the research, the idea was to insulate insects so their movements could be studied in the vacuum of the electron microscope’s sample chamber, so there’s not going to be a team working on these issues in the near or far future. But at least we now know that there really is something to the electromagnetic shielding we see in sci-fi all the time, even though it would make for a lousy spacesuit…</p>

<p>Now, I’ve written a great deal about <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/tag/ancient-astronauts/\">the ancient astronaut hypothesis</a>, the idea that alien beings had profound influence on our evolution and civilization. Usually, when I did, I talked about a lack of a smoking gun for extraterrestrial meddling in our genome or our politics, and pointed out just how rare it would be for an advanced alien species with a passion for exploration to evolve close to the same time period as us, detect our planet, cross light years to get here, and have interest in doing anything on Earth to cover the scientific basics. But what about another line of evidence from ancient astronaut believers? According to them pictures of weird beings and stories of all sorts of bizarre creatures, monsters, and mysterious chariots in the sky must point to visitations, an assertion countered by skeptics with alternative explanations that usually have to do with the religious art commonly produced by the civilizations in question or pointing out the believers’ all too tenuous grasp of the historical facts and games of confirmation bias.</p>
<p>However, there’s another idea that seems to be missing. Our ancestors wrote fiction and were every bit as creative as we are. In fact, we have records of jokes that date to nearly 4,000 years ago and epic sagas that are more than a thousand years old. Fun fact, the oldest known joke in human history is a fart joke. The second? A joke about women wearing nothing but fishnets for the visual benefit of a pharaoh. The oldest European joke? A bait and switch riddle that seemed to be describing a penis. Yes, humanity hasn’t changed all that much when it comes to humor, I know. And that’s precisely the point. We shouldn’t take everything we see from the past literally like ancient astronaut believers, although we sometimes do. The legend of King Arthur written in Perceval has inspired many true believers today to argue that there’s a real Holy Grail, just see the book on which the DaVinci Code was based: Holy Blood, Hold Grail. Despite being written as an epic fictional tale with colorful characters and fictional creatures, people take parts of it to be factual or based on fact simply because they mention other mostly or semi-fictional works.</p>
<p>So when an ancient astronaut theorist invokes ancient texts, why not ask how he or she knows if the text was meant to be taken seriously? Were the flying creatures on flaming chariots part of a religious tract meant to guide worshipers of ancient gods or was it entertaining fiction for those who ruled our first empires? How many of the soap operas meant to describe the life of the gods in ancient mythology was canon and how much were creative add-ons? When we read ancient texts on religious matters, are we confusing their versions of Bibles with their versions of the Left Behind books? We know our ancestors were creative enough to dream up gods and monsters, and mastermind engineering projects that would take decades to complete. We know there were great epics with highly fictionalized tales of past wars and natural disasters, and we know there were countless books lost as ancient libraries were burnt down by illiterate conquerors or rabid zealots. So why do ancient astronaut theorists insist on treating every artifact from the past as a record of a historical fact rather than even pretend to allow for works for art and fiction?</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F04%2F22%2Fseparating-ancient-history-from-ancient-fiction%2F&title=separating%20ancient%20history%20from%20ancient%20fiction\" id=\"wpa2a_40\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/22/separating-ancient-history-from-ancient-fiction/#comments" "20ef474762f77a01b1e8b18e343a6275") (40 (20930 47205 817222) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/19/why-we-cant-follow-project-kronos-blueprint/" "why we =?utf-8?Q?can=E2=80=99t?= follow project =?utf-8?Q?kronos=E2=80=99?= blueprint" "Greg Fish" "Wed, 19 Jun 2013 20:37:42 +0000" "<p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/65014898\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<p>Project Kronos, the short fake documentary by visual effects artist Hasraf ‘HaZ’ Dulull about first contact and the possible origins of interplanetary travel by humans in the relatively near future, recently got plenty of attention on the web. And it should have. It’s a well done piece of work, its premise is developed enough to keep you glued to the screen, and its pacing and storyline are open ended and somewhat disturbing enough to provoke a lot of speculation. As a piece of art, this is really, really good. But before anyone gets ideas about sending our artificially reanimated brains in spherical vessels to roam the cosmos in a dream-like state, I’m afraid that a skeptic will need to step in to do some fact checking on the science regardless of how well Project Kronos was put together. Considering that I’m in one of the key fields involved, it may as well be me, so let’s unpickle some flying cosmic brains and figure out whether you really want to analyze fuzzy dreams on your way to meet an alien intelligence trying to summon you to the stars.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, mapping the neurons responsible in remembering what someone saw could be done, and <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/gallantlabucb/publications/nishimoto-et-al-2011\" target=\"_blank\">there’s been some success in trying to see what another person has seen by looking through his memories</a>. With enough time and more accurate devices, it’s not implausible to get much better resolution, maybe even as good as some of the fuzzy images of the brain implanted into the Kronos probe. But then again, you’re spending hundreds of millions, if not billions to get to interstellar space. Don’t you want extremely powerful high resolution images taken with crystal clarity so scientists can study what the probe gleams on flyby? Don’t you want a sensor array to measure everything from the solar wind to atmosphere of the gas giants’ moons? The film’s very ambitious space agency basically decided to take a shortcut to nearly human equivalent AI with an actual human brain, then launched it into deep space bereft of the tools to make the probe a source of good data for planetary scientists, focusing instead of establishing first contact based on the idea that a human brain would handle aliens better than a recording. But would it?</p>
<p>One of the more disconcerting things for me in the documentary is the notion of the brain kept alive after the person using is has presumably died of natural causes. Now, as someone who’d happily donate his body to science after I’m done using it, on the one hand, I would welcome the opportunity of being essentially resurrected as a space probe. In fact, on the surface, it sounds like one of my wildest dreams come true. To be brought back to life in some form and launched to travel the stars for eons on end. The concept is poetic, really. But the reality? Not so much. It would be the most extreme kind of sensory deprivation you could imagine. Yes, you could travel the cosmos and see planets no one has even seen before, but for the vast majority of the trip, you’d be surrounded by silent blackness. No friends, no family, very little interaction from Earth, and most of said interaction would be one way. Your thoughts and memories would be decoded and played back like a movie, complete with images of the life you once lead. What you have to look forward to is eons of solitary confinement in a completely alien environment.</p>
<p>Of course this is presuming that your brain will still be usable after death. Unlike the machine, it will deteriorate. Over time its functions will degrade, memories would be difficult to keep, and the probe will grow less and less reliable. Add this to the isolation it will experience and any aliens in range of a Kronos orb will more than likely be trying to make contact with an entity suffering from mental illness and with rapidly deteriorating cognitive abilities. At this point, a recording would be much more preferable. Now, you might wonder if the brain in a Kronos probe would actually live in any real sense. After all, it is just being zapped with a little electricity and given some nutrients so it can function but it’s not really embodied anymore and kept in a dream-like state. The film is not really clear on this point, oscillating between the scientists treating the brain as a substrate, and indicating that it would be capable of an emotional response, meaning that it may be sort of alive in a conventional sense. Maybe this is why the Human 2.0 project meant to respond to the alien attempt at first contact uses a fleet of probes. Maybe they’ll keep each other sane.</p>
<p>Still, note that first contact happens after aliens hack a human brain in robot form. That’s a very disconcerting feat. It means that the extraterrestrial life form either managed to figure out binary protocols for our electronics and how they map to analog buzz produced by our neurons, or had a machine capable of doing that. More than likely, they’ve either done it before or developed an absolutely amazing grasp on how to decipher brain machine interfaces in other species. They’d have to basically torture the brain in Kronos to figure this out from scratch, not on purpose, but they would more or less have to wire into the orb and zap the brain to see what happens so the inference map for how it works could be built. Does sending a hundred more Kronos probes to the coordinates they provided seem like a good idea in this light? Certainly not to me. Seems a tad dangerous to put it mildly. Sure it’s first contact, but with what and why? I could imagine this encounter suddenly diverting trillions around the world into building a heavily armed space fleet just in case, should the memories of the Kronos brain give the aliens too much information.</p>
<p>But all this aside, I can understand what Project Kronos was trying to show. Humans, as we are today, are more or less marooned on Earth. We’re not ready to live in deep space until we start to change ourselves through genetic engineering and significant augmentation, until we defeat aging as we know it and learn how to encase our bodies in materials that will keep us save from radiation and let us stand on other worlds without worrying about toxic chemicals, radiation, and the bone, joint, and muscle damage from changing gravities. The odds of us being brains in tiny orbs floating through the vastness of space are non-zero, especially if bean counters have their way with the future of space travel, but it’s not the best way to explore the final frontier. No, the best way forward for us is roaming space stations, vast interstellar ships, and cyborg bodies. It’s our need to be social, our embodiment, and our sense of community and adventure that define us, and if we want to boldly go into interstellar space, we need to carry them with us. That and a lot of weapons in case random aliens start giving us trouble by trying to hack into our brains…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F19%2Fwhy-we-cant-follow-project-kronos-blueprint%2F&title=why%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20follow%20project%20kronos%E2%80%99%20blueprint\" id=\"wpa2a_2\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/19/why-we-cant-follow-project-kronos-blueprint/#comments" "90d1d7f6ceb80b24d3afd65f94087a14") (39 (20930 47205 815411) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/15/the-infinitely-vast-mandatory-miltiverse/" "the infinitely vast, mandatory multiverse?"

<p>At two events of the <a href=\"http://worldsciencefestival.com/events/cosmic_conjecture\" target=\"_blank\">Wolrd Science Festival</a> in early June,  a group of five theoretical physicists debated whether we’re living in a multiverse, and more surprisingly, if our current understanding of the cosmos all but mandates that multiple universes exist. It all goes back to the instant of the Big Bang, the femtosecond that set the rules for all reality as we know it in scientific terms. Each tiny little quantum instability and flux was stretched and projected across billions of light years to influence the shape of galaxy clusters and the tiny filaments what underpin <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/01/15/did-the-cosmological-principle-get-knocked-down/\">our mostly isotropic, homogeneous universe</a>. It’s kind of like the chaos theory saying about a flap of a butterfly’s wings eventually causing a tsunami halfway across the world, but taken to incredible extremes. We’re talking about a change in point particles becoming an archipelago a million galaxies across. So, why wouldn’t some of these instabilities become their own universes, sealed off from each other by the fabric of space and time? The inflation we just described should make this inevitable.</p>
<p>Here’s the issue. As our infant universe was inflating, it shouldn’t have spun off uniformly since that would make the fluctuations in early matter impossible and prevented the formation of stars and galaxies. It would’ve had to have large enough disruptions to kick-start other universes, or even itself be a product of another universe undergoing rapid inflation. And if one universe can inflate, so too must the rest because otherwise, inflation becomes a unique event and science is not happy with a one-off event as an explanation. Every significant process we know of happens more than once and on universal time scales of countless trillions of years, the possibilities are pretty much infinite. We should be able to see new universes bubbling up from dark voids in the fabric of space-time, over time. There might even be room to imagine a bizarre, hyper-advanced species of the far future crossing into a brand new universe as theirs dies in a void ship isolated from reality as we know it, Doctor Who-style, hopefully one that’s nothing like the Daleks.</p>
<p>Problem is, how do we prove that inflation works in more than one universe when we can’t see into the multiverse? One suggestion is that inflation basically wraps the universe into a sphere, an unbreachable, self-contained environment that seems flat to us and where trying to travel to the edge of the cosmos will result in the spaceship ending up back where it started as if it were on a Mobius strip. Simple, elegant, and convenient as far as solutions to cosmological problems go, don’t you think? And that’s precisely what’s so bothersome about it. Nothing in cosmology is that simple, even inflation itself. Instead of slowing down, it’s accelerating. Instead of flying apart into clouds of stars and gas under their own momentum, galaxies are keeping their shapes until a collision distorts them thanks to invisible dark matter. Hell, some 96% of the universe isn’t even matter and almost three quarters of it is some mysterious energy feeding its expansion. Does it really make sense that in a universe like that simple, convenient explanations will fly?</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F15%2Fthe-infinitely-vast-mandatory-miltiverse%2F&title=the%20infinitely%20vast%2C%20mandatory%20multiverse%3F\" id=\"wpa2a_4\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/15/the-infinitely-vast-mandatory-miltiverse/#comments" "c96333a9302c191798615b76602e3604") (38 (20930 47205 814376) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/12/how-to-approach-a-problem-with-mind-wide-shut/" "how to approach a problem with mind wide shut" "Greg Fish" "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 21:44:20 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/evo_marketing_440.jpg?resize=440%2C330\" alt=\"evolution marketing / darwin fish design\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7131\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Alarmed by the growing number of atheists among the current generation of young adults, one organization of Christians decided to sit some down for an interview to learn why they became atheists, drew conclusions, summed them up, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/listening-to-young-atheists-lessons-for-a-stronger-christianity/276584/\" target=\"_blank\">and respectfully posted them online</a>. Unlike many other faith groups, they legitimately wanted to understand what atheists thought and why, and what prompted their de-conversions. Problem is that they didn’t want to understand if all those atheists they interviewed had a point when discussing the improbability of an omniscient deity in their lives, ruling the universe from afar, yet being involved in the fate of every living thing. They were running a focus group to see what it would take to put those atheists back in the pews in a classic example of listening but not hearing. In their worldview, the inability of a pastor to prove that their faith is based on facts rather than tradition is the failure of a pastor since the infallibility of the religion is assumed as an unquestionable given.</p>
<p>The tone of the summary is almost clinical, like a psychiatrist surveying his patients and dutifully describing their pathologies to be analyzed by others. And while listing the reasons why atheists leave churches or never enter one, the piece recited a mantra declaring that Christianity is hard to understand, difficult to live up to, and teaches us to engage with the real world. As if a belief that an omniscient, omnipotent being incarnated as his own son to forgive humans for what he declared to be sins through self-sacrifice is as scientifically well proven as the structure of DNA. This is why this so-called \"interfatih dialogue\" is a bad idea for atheists. They’re not participants with a voice who get to express their views in a debate. They’re either patients to be studied for the future, or potential new believers yet to be swayed as far as the faithful are concerned. Yes, they might act like the nicest people in the world, but they’re not listening to you. They’re looking at you like a biologist looks at a dolphin and wondering how to teach you to do a trick…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F12%2Fhow-to-approach-a-problem-with-mind-wide-shut%2F&title=how%20to%20approach%20a%20problem%20with%20mind%20wide%20shut\" id=\"wpa2a_6\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/12/how-to-approach-a-problem-with-mind-wide-shut/#comments" "a5dde35683ea27844bf8813186709a2b") (37 (20930 47205 813058) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/11/social-media-the-best-way-to-share-with-friends-family-and-nsa-analysists/" "social media, the best way to share with friends, family, and nsa analysists" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 21:21:41 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/surveillance_camera_array_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"surveillance camera array\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16600\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>On the one hand, I am somewhat surprised by recent revelations about exactly how much we’re being watched on the internet by the NSA. However, the big surprise for me is that they couldn’t get data form Twitter. Considering that <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/03/22/how-would-the-nsa-surf-a-tsunami-of-data/\">it’s building an immense data center in Utah</a>, and works with tech companies on a regular basis, is it really that astonishing that the agency is browsing through our communications metadata on a regular basis? We all suspected this was the case, so if anything the current furor is almost a required reaction of anger and hurt to have what we always thought was happening and didn’t really want to, actually is happening. The question is what to do now, in the PRISM-aware world. Citizens know they’re being caught up in the dragnet when they’re just going about their day, foreign companies are afraid of the NSA spying on them via the advanced cloud technology the United States sells across the globe, and China could sit back and laugh off American reports of its hacking and spying on the web as hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Another fun fact is that Americans are actually split on how they feel about the NSA’s snooping and a majority of 56% <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/10/majority-views-nsa-phone-tracking-as-acceptable-anti-terror-tactic/\" target=\"_blank\">says that privacy is an acceptable casualty in trying to catch terrorists</a>. It might also be telling that the split hasn’t changed much since 2006 and that it breaks down by a distinct partisan preference, with liberals and conservatives flip-flopping on the issue when the other party was in the White House. So while the press is incensed and investigative reporters are falling all over themselves to talk about PRISM, the American people are shrugging it off by party affiliation. I would expect everyone to carry on as normal because if Facebook and Google didn’t have a mass exodus of accounts, it’s very unlikely they will. Plus, the NSA isn’t reading all the e-mail in your inbox. It just has a record of you e-mailing someone at a given time and if you are in the United States, your phone number and e-mail should be crossed out in their system, until of course a secret court order grants the analysis access to request the whole e-mail.</p>
<p>Even the slowdown in purchases of American high tech gear is likely to be temporary because much of what we’re hearing from many other countries is an almost mandatory response to the revelations about PRISM. In reality, many of the countries buying these tech products have very extensive spy networks of their own and engage in cyber-espionage on a daily basis. It’s kettle calling the pot black, and it’s likely that the rumors of tech companies giving the NSA back door access into their servers are just not true. There’s a number of ways to supply data to the NSA and a number of ways the NSA could’ve gotten the data itself. I’m not going to speculate how in this post because a) I don’t know the agency’s exact capabilities, b) there are people from both defense contractors and military agencies reading this blog who I’d just annoy with speculating, and c) most of them are probably much worse than having the companies just play ball when a court order comes down and an incredibly powerful agency is knocking on their door.</p>
<p>Now, none of this means this isn’t a big deal. But what it does signal is that the country which is dominating the world in the tech field and serves as the key node in the global communications grid <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/02/20/how-cyberwarfare-is-becoming-the-new-black/\">has been crying wolf about cyberwarfare and espionage</a> while actively waging it. We were starting to be sure of this when Stuxnet was discovered, we suspected it even stronger when all of its ingenious siblings like Flame and Duqu floated into the spotlight, we had a good idea that the United State was publicly holding back when reports of its potential in cyberwarfare drills with allied nations started surfacing, and with PRISM, we now know it for a fact. On the one hand, it’s bad news because your privacy is now not only being compromised by bad security or very lax internal policies of web giants, but by the government as well.

<p>According to Wired’s <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/05/actually-getting-to-mars/?pid=6958&viewall=true\" target=\"_blank\">laundry list of technical and political issues with getting humans to Mars by the year 2030 or so</a>, exploring another planet many millions of miles away won’t be Apollo 2.0 in many ways. It will be an order of magnitude more expensive per launch, require 30 months for a round trip, and needs to be financed, overseen, and executed by an international group that will include space agencies and ambitious aerospace companies with plans and launch vehicles of their own. And yet, the designs being drawn up sound remarkably like Apollo on steroids. We’re basically working with the same basic mission plans we had in the 1980s with a few workarounds for handling fuel and oxygen. Come on folks, this is another planet. It’s not just a status symbol and <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/03/02/why-a-flyby-of-mars-may-not-live-up-to-its-intention/\">we don’t need to rush there just to say we went</a>. Really, we don’t. Flag planting is great for propaganda and PR purposes, but it’s disastrous for long term exploration, which needs to be a very boring, consistent, and yes, expensive effort. We need a better plan than this.</p>
<p>Now, as much as this blog will support my assertion that I’m all about space exploration and will go as far as to advocate augmenting humans to travel into deep space (which led to numerous arguments with the Singularity Institute’s fellows), we don’t have to go to Mars as soon as we’re able to launch. It’s been there for 4.5 billion years. It’s not going anywhere for at least another five billion, and we owe it to ourselves to do it right. This is why instead of sending a much bigger capsule or an updated ISS for a 30 month round trip, we need to send inflatable, rotating space stations powered by small nuclear reactors. Instead of landers, we need to send self-assembling habitats. Instead of going to Mars to stick a flag into the ground, collect rocks, and do some very brief and limited experiments to look for traces of organic compounds, we need to commit to an outright colonization effort, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/04/30/why-we-need-to-return-to-the-moon/\">and we need to test the basics on the Moon before we go</a>. We won’t fulfill our dreams of roaming the stars and living on alien worlds if we don’t get this right.</p>
<p>Yes, it sounds downright crazy to propose something like that, especially thanks to the political climates of today. And it is. But at the risk of repeating myself, when we have trillions of banks to erase their bad bets from the books and nothing to aid the paltry budgets of space agencies or labs working on the technology of the future, the issue isn’t money. It’s priorities, vision, and will, and today’s politicians have the first one skewed, and more often than not either lack the other two, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/30/why-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science/\">or envision our society going backwards</a> as if this is a good thing. And we can keep right on placating ourselves by saying that we’ll at least get to roam around the solar system a bit like we did once, but that’s not how we should be exploring space. We know it’s not. if you want to really reach out into space, you go in for the long term with your eye on the spin-offs and benefits that will rain down from massive, ambitious, integrated projects that try to do what’s never been done before not by reinventing the wheel, but by attaching said wheel to a new airplane.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F10%2Fwhy-mars-is-not-the-next-apollo%2F&title=why%20mars%20is%20not%20the%20next%20apollo\" id=\"wpa2a_10\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/10/why-mars-is-not-the-next-apollo/#comments" "e9bf353a2077398db3abd3d209546d5d") (35 (20930 47205 810609) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/08/the-impotent-cry-against-reason-and-logic/" "the impotent cry against reason and logic" "Greg Fish" "Sat, 08 Jun 2013 19:02:34 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/far_future_city_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"far future city\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16759\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Ever since the New Atheists arrived on the scene, there’s be a loud, wailing siren from religious and humanities pundits decrying the idea that we could use science to explain the universe that we occupy. Generally their argument for why we can’t use reason and experiments to clear up a lot of mysteries and what makes us tick <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2013/06/the_science_delusion_by_curtis_white_reviewed.single.html\" target=\"_blank\">boils down to \"how dare you say you can explain all this complexity and wonder in math and mechanistic descriptions?\"</a> And that’s really as far as it goes because their objection to using science to explain their pet topics in the language of formulas, statistics, and data sets is that it takes away a mystery they so desperately wanted to preserve for another sermon or tome of nebulous ponderings on the human condition. While researchers and engineers see the beauty in knowing how things work, science-phobic pontificators rush to the fainting couches, distraught that someone dare to explain their minds as sprawling networks neurons and accumulated experience alongside evolutionary mechanisms.</p>
<p>If you’re one of those people who needs to be a mysterious, delicate snowflake who is just way too complicated and nuanced to study, I’m sorry, but we can’t help you. Knowing how the world around us works in scientific, mechanistic language is how we build modern societies, land on a different world, send robots into deep space, and find cures for what ails us. If you refuse to see how knowing what makes the universe tick gives your existence even more meaning and a very enviable ability to modify the world to accomplish something, even to a small extent, that is your personal problem. Now, far be it from me to say that literature or religions never made profound contributions to humanity because they have. But what they couldn’t do was to find and confirm solid, experimentally proven, reliable answers to big questions about who we are and where we might be going. Science has given us a vast, complex, mysterious universe, and they’re upset that we can derive some algebra to try and explain how a few bits of it fit together?</p>
<p>Consider this. If you’re loudly and publicly rebelling against the scourge of \"arrogant scientism\" but you’ve ever tried something to find out what will happen and then repeated your experiment to confirm it, you’re a hypocrite. You relied on the scientific method to answer your question, not those nebulous \"other ways of knowing.\" Come to think of it, what are all of these \"other ways of knowing\" we hear invoked so often by both a fundamentalist zealot with a mind wide shut, and a crunchy New Ager with equal zeal? Voices of an omnipotent deity? The universe telling you that we’re all connected <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/05/09/how-new-agers-escape-the-human-condition/\">in a creationist fantasy for left wing anti-intellectuals</a>? That’s just your brain making shit up to put it bluntly. You can attend philosophical seminars and conventions of tweed suit-clad graybeards, huffing and puffing, and looking serious, saying \"isn’t life so mysterious?\" as Tim Minchin once put it, and rage against the fact that science can explain things that were once said to be off limits to mere mortals. It won’t change the fact that it’s our ability to explore, dissect, catalog, explain, and predict though science that makes us who we are.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F08%2Fthe-impotent-cry-against-reason-and-logic%2F&title=the%20impotent%20cry%20against%20reason%20and%20logic\" id=\"wpa2a_12\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/08/the-impotent-cry-against-reason-and-logic/#comments" "225a4eaa00a5e01227bf25b4977516e9") (34 (20930 47205 805923) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/04/does-meeting-online-mean-a-better-marriage-sort-of-but-dont-get-carried-away/" "does meeting online mean a better marriage? sort of, but =?utf-8?Q?don=E2=80=99t?= get carried =?utf-8?Q?away=E2=80=A6?=" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 04 Jun 2013 21:54:09 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/newlyweds_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"newlyweds\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16751\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>There’s been a bit of a splash by a new study which says that meeting your spouse online could mean a longer, happier marriage, and confirms that far from being the last refuge of lonely shut-ins, online dating is now one of the top ways to meet your mate. Now, the numbers do bear this conclusion out. Out of a representative sample of 19,131 people, the researchers found that a couple that met online is 28% less likely to divorce than their offline matched counterparts, and that the happiest marriages start with a meeting in MMORPGs and on social networks. However, and you knew this was coming, the differences are statistically significant but far from huge, and there are several caveats to taking the findings too close to heart, caveats which result directly from the study’s design. Basically, they’re collecting some demographic information if a subject was married between 2005 and 2012, asking how the subject met his or her spouse, and how happy the marriage seems, then looking for any statistically notable trends to emerge.</p>
<p>Here’s what the data mining found. A smidgen more than a third of the subjects (35%) married a person they met online. Half of those meetings happened on a dating site, usually eHarmony or Match.com, which each claim a quarter of these dating site meetups. So if you’re looking to get into a serious relationship or get married, those sites are probably a very good bet. Likewise, a few very interesting data points jump out from the results. The more well educated and gainfully employed you are, the more likely you are to meet a serious partner online. Those who earn at least $75,000 per year and have a college education represent some 57% of relationships that started online. Oddly enough, those with graduate degrees have the lowest share of marriages to partners they met online, under 15% of the total. The data doesn’t show why, but I would be interested in figuring this out. Why is this finding so worthy of attention? Because it may have a connection to <a href=\"http://economy.money.cnn.com/2012/05/02/the-rich-are-working-harder/\" target=\"_blank\">the so-called leisure inequality</a> and tell us more about why online dating grown so much in the last decade or so. But I digress. Now, what about that marriage satisfaction?</p>
<p>Well, again, the numbers do show that people who married their online friends report a better marriage, especially those who met playing online games or on social networks (which could or could not include dating sites, the paper isn’t specific on this). On a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being the equivalent of \"I’m ready to file for divorce this second\" and 7 being \"this marriage is perfect,\" these subjects reported an average satisfaction score of 5.72, which is pretty damn good. But if we consider the score of the most miserable married couples who met offline in a bar or through a blind date, they still post a very respectable 5.35 average. Yes, the online couples are happy and they’re happier than many other couples, but not by leaps and bounds. Could you really tell the difference between a 5.35 and a 5.72 happy when general contentment is 3.5? If we indulge in paraphrasing Futurama, these researchers are techncially correct, the best kind of correct in science. But practically, they just found close to 20,000 happy couples, a third of which just so happened to have met online and got married in a certain time range.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the biggest caveat with this study. Only 8% of these subjects are divorced which is both, a lot lower than the national average, and only shows the short term trend. If you look at marriages 10 years out rather than the seven for this survey, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr049.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the odds of a divorce are about 30% or so</a>. Get 20 years out and the odds increase to 48% on the high end. The sample here just hasn’t been married long enough and it’s probably a safe assumption that a lot were caught in their early phases of marriage. But the goal for getting married generally tends to be staying married for life, which means roughly half a century, going by the typical life expectancy figures. The researchers are, in a sense, catching people a mile or two into a marathon when a whole lot usually hasn’t happened yet and the biggest bumps in the road are still ahead, getting a general thumbs up from some 92% of the respondents, and splitting hairs about who gave the most enthusiastic thumbs up. True, this doesn’t mean that there’s a problem with a marriage to someone you met online and yes, maybe these couples are happier. But it’s too soon to tell.</p>
<p>Likewise, we should also point out <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/06/how-to-live-in-a-world-where-marriage-is-in-decline/276476/\" target=\"_blank\">that marriage rates keep on falling</a> and the domestic partner has been slowly becoming the new spouse. After witnessing messy divorces and confronted by general antipathy for marriage from many sides, a lot of people who would’ve already tied the knot are deciding to forgo the whole affair altogether. Now, this could mean that what the survey captured is a trend of people who get married staying together longer and being happier while more and more of their peers are opting out of married life, balancing out the high divorce rate over the next decade or so, but this is just an idea after looking at the data. Marriage as we are used to it in the modern world is changing. It’s becoming less commonplace, involves those who are more financially secure, and alternative households are becoming the new norm. So in light of all these changes, maybe the better question to ask is not what makes for a happier marriage but what makes for happy long term relationships, or at least what today’s long term relationship looks like from an academic standpoint. Work in that area is only beginning…</p>

<p>According to the stream of reports from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the Arctic ice is slowly but surely disappearing. Well, slowly for us humans. On geologic time scales, it’s thawing in the blink of an eye. For this year, the extent of the ice is <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2013/03/annual-maximum-extent-reached/\" target=\"_blank\">the sixth lowest on record</a>, and last year, there was about <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/charctic-interactive-sea-ice-graph/\" target=\"_blank\">half as much ice at minimum as there was between 1979 and 2000</a>, while also being much thinner. On the other side of the world, Antarctica is not doing much better as an average of <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/20100108_Is_Antarctica_Melting.html\" target=\"_blank\">100 cubic kilometers of ice are lost every year</a>, despite ice sliding into the ocean from dry land seemingly increasing the reach of sea ice. Now, this prompted many denialists to distribute a talking point that while the Arctic is melting, Antarctica is gaining ice, which would be true only if you measure sea ice and forget that there’s an entire continent thawing, sending all that excess ice out to sea. It’s sort of like claiming a virgin birth by forgetting to mention that the couple isn’t married and the child’s father lives across town, visiting every other day.</p>
<p>But all this said, there’s the big question is how bad all this thawing is for us. Sea levels may rise between 16 and 22 feet, changing coastlines and altering climactic cycles over a century. How worried should we be? And is there any way to stop it? Well, exactly how worried you should be would depend on where you live and whether you think another century is too short of a time to move the cities back from the sea. The world is not going to flood as shown in many apocalyptic posters from environmental groups. To drown a city like that would require massive and sudden natural disasters like asteroid impacts or a magnitude 9.1 quake that triggers a monster tsunami and sends it towards a city built mostly below sea level. No city planner 30 or 70 years from now would be dealing with the same exact coastlines, and old buildings could be moved or altered to deal with the rising water. Of course, if we didn’t emit nearly as much carbon dioxide by building our economies around energy efficiency, we could just avoid all of that in the first place.</p>
<p>Though, just to play Devil’s advocate, there’s an interesting point that needs to be raised. New economies and infrastructures are expensive. Very expensive. And the thawing Arctic means a shorter path between Europe, Asia, and North America than the Panama Canal. Goods can get to their destinations cheaper, new fiber can be laid for a faster, more redundant internet, and a lot of oil and natural gas will be open to exploration far away from the Middle East. And while as the United States and Canada extract more and more oil from the Arctic, OPEC could just lower production to keep prices high, the political ramifications are huge and to many, worth perusing. Is potential energy independence that will let the United States disentangle itself from the Middle East and its messy affairs, while creating new jobs and cozy ties with its neighbors worth moving some big cities back from the rising seas? And do the improved economics of fast, new shipping lanes and extra fiber-optic cables just sweeten the deal to let it all melt?</p>
<p>Before we get carried away though, there is a downside to such strategic terraforming. Warmer climates mean more droughts in areas that are now among the world’s bread baskets, and a lot less food. In some countries, which produce far more food than they can consume or send over as aid, this isn’t a pressing issue. But in countries not producing enough, or just barely enough to get by, famines could easily reemerge because the farmlands couldn’t be moved to land that belongs to another state. For nations on good terms, there might be a deal in the making. For countries that view each other as an existential threat (like India and Pakistan), not so much. Oh and bad news for foodies. When food sources become any scarcer in a warmer world, the only viable response is doubling down on hyper-efficient factory farms that employ methods that can drive a panel of Food Network chefs up a wall. Point is that your experience with the effects of a warmer Earth may vary depending on many factors, but deciding how to manage the warming is not as cut and dry as a yes or a no, there’s an economic and geopolitical calculus involved…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F02%2Fyes-the-ice-caps-are-melting-but-is-that-bad%2F&title=yes%2C%20the%20ice%20caps%20are%20melting%2C%20but%20is%20that%20bad%3F\" id=\"wpa2a_16\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/02/yes-the-ice-caps-are-melting-but-is-that-bad/#comments" "346133df53769d1d44c524c510e67e18") (32 (20930 47205 803011) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/31/how-to-create-a-self-fulfilling-anti-tech-prophecy-with-withering-cynicism/" "how to create a self-fulfilling anti-tech prophecy with withering cynicism" "Greg Fish" "Fri, 31 May 2013 14:00:05 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dubai_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"dubai_600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16740\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Last time we took a look at <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/03/and-now-for-a-little-technophobic-paternalism/\">what tech cynics and technophobes get wrong in their arguments</a>, we focused on their lack of consideration for their fellow humans’ ability to exercise free will. Despite the fact that this is a huge hole in many of their arguments, there’s an even bigger problem with the dismissive stance they take towards science and technology. When they argue that we can’t feed all the hungry  house all the homeless, or really prolong lifespans with technology, the facts they cite generally point not so much to technological limitations or scientific ignorance, but very convoluted social and political problems, then insist that because science and technology can’t solve them today, they likely never will, or won’t solve them adequately to consider the problem much smaller than it is today. While this argument is true, it’s also logically dishonest. You can’t fix the world’s problems with technology when the people who should be using it refuse to do so, or hijack it for their own less than noble means. No tool or piece of knowledge can help then.</p>
<p>As some of you might have noticed, the city in the graphic for this post in Dubai, a rich proving ground for how the cities of the near future are likely to be built. We know how to make cities of glass, steel, and concrete right out of science fiction. We know how to build the cheap, efficient housing complexes those making less than a dollar a day need to at least have secure shelter. We know how do diagnose complex diseases early enough to treat them before they’ll become dangerous, much less terminal, and our toolkits for understanding germs, viruses, and complex medical problems like cancers, are growing to become more sophisticated every day. We also have the tools and the money to apply all these solutions to the world at large. With something a little bit short of $100 billion just between Gates and Buffet pledged to fight poverty  illiteracy, and disease, and when we can find $2 trillion laying around to help banks with a do-over, clearly, it’s not an issue of not having the technology, the scientific basis, or the cash. The issue is will.</p>
<p>Sure technological utopians have lofty ambitions and <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/08/08/when-technocrats-think-theyre-better-than-you/\">it’s valid to be skeptical of many of them</a>, but when they vow that logistical problems can be solved with enough computing and research, they’re right more often than not. When the cynics deride these ambitions by pointing out that a lot of people don’t want to fund mass production of the necessary tools or the required science, and would much prefer to spend them on entertainment and public entitlements benefiting them directly, they’re not highlighting the problems with using technology to save the world, they’re a prime exhibit of why a technology hasn’t transformed the world of fixed a persistent problem. All too often it comes down to them saying it can’t be done, and politicians along with voters simply listening to them and deciding that no, it’s can’t be done since the critics said so, which is why it would be a waste of time to even bother. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure, a social variation of Newton’s First Law: a society that insists on the status quo, sticks to the status quo unless an external event or constant pressure forces it to change. </p>
<p>It’s the same attitude <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/08/11/whats-holding-back-modern-science-and-technology/\">which strangled the promising and much anticipated future of space travel and exploration</a>, and we’re still stuck with it. Yes, not every retro-futuristic dream about space or living on other worlds was practical or even feasible  and yes, we did need experts to burst our bubble before an unworkable project got off the ground. But today’s science and tech critics are going well past a healthy skepticism about bold claims and venturing into a territory in which they dismiss scientific and technological solutions to global problems for the sake of dismissing them, pointing to other ideas they dismissed in the past and doomed to being chained to the drawing board, and saying that because their relentless cynicism killed the ideas rather than refined the scopes and missions to eliminate problems with them, new ideas building on past visions must be scrapped as well. It’s even more insidious than <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/30/why-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science/\">political vetting of basic science</a>, because vetting at least allows some projects to survive and get refined into new tools and ideas. The withering cynicism of what science and technology can do for us is like an anti-innovation WMD…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F31%2Fhow-to-create-a-self-fulfilling-anti-tech-prophecy-with-withering-cynicism%2F&title=how%20to%20create%20a%20self-fulfilling%20anti-tech%20prophecy%20with%20withering%20cynicism\" id=\"wpa2a_18\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/31/how-to-create-a-self-fulfilling-anti-tech-prophecy-with-withering-cynicism/#comments" "5badba47b2c23b8dc2c88b042bd836d2") (31 (20930 47205 799579) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/29/why-scientists-really-dont-need-the-input-of-philosophers-like-raymond-tallis/" "why scientists really =?utf-8?Q?don=E2=80=99t?= need the input of philosophers like raymond tallis" "Greg Fish" "Wed, 29 May 2013 14:33:11 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/grumpy_cat_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"grumpy_cat_600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16736\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>A long time ago, I shared one of my favorite jokes about philosophers. It went like this. Once, a president of a large and prestigious university was asked who were his most expensive staff to fund. \"Phycisists and computer scientists,\" he replied without hesitation, \"they always want some brand new machine that costs a fortune to build and operate, not like mathematicians who only need paper, pencils, and erasers. Or better yet, my philosophers. Those guys don’t even need the erasers!\" Yes, yes, I know, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/07/15/trying-to-find-the-limits-of-philosophy/\">I’m a philosophical phillistine</a>, I’ve been told of this so many times that I should start some sort of contest. But my lack of reverence for the discipline is not helped by philosophers who decide to speak up for their occupation in an age of big data and powerful, new tools for scientific experimentation to propose answers to new and ever more complex real world questions. Case in point, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/27/physics-philosophy-quantum-relativity-einstein\" target=\"_blank\">a column by Raymond Tallis</a> declaring that physics is broken so much so that it needs metaphysics to pull itself back together and produce real results.</p>
<p>Physics is a discipline near and dear to my heart because certain subsets of it can be applied to cutting edge hardware, and as someone whose primary focus is distributed computing, the area of computer science which gives us all our massive web applications, cloud storage, and parallel processing, there’s a lot of value in keeping up with the relevant underlying science. And maybe there’s already an inherent bias here when my mind starts to wonder how metaphysics will help someone build a quantum cloud or <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/01/14/to-boost-data-density-chill-and-apply-magnetism/\">radically increase hard drive density</a>, but the bigger problem is that Tallis doesn’t seem to have any command of the scientific issues he declares to be in dire need of graybeards in tweed suits pondering the grand mechanics of existence with little more than the p’s and q’s of propositional logic. For example, take his description of why physics has chased itself into a corner with quantum mechanics…</p>
<blockquote><p>A better-kept secret is that at the heart of quantum mechanics is a disturbing paradox – the so-called measurement problem, arising ultimately out of the Uncertainty Principle – which apparently demonstrates that the very measurements that have established and confirmed quantum theory should be impossible. Oxford philosopher of physics David Wallace has argued that this threatens to make quantum mechanics incoherent which can be remedied only by vastly multiplying worlds.</p></blockquote>
<p>As science bloggers love to say, this isn’t even wrong. Tallis and Wallace have mixed up three very different concepts into a grab bag of confusion. Quantum mechanics can do <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/04/27/oh-quantum-causality-we-hardly-knew-ye/\">very, very odd things that seem to defy the normal flow of time</a>, but there’s nothing that says we can’t know the general topology of a quantum system. The oft cited and abused Uncertainty Principle is based on the fact that certain fundamental building blocks of the universe can function as both a wave and a particle, and each state has its own set of measurements. If you try to treat the blocks as particles, you can measure the properties of the particle state. If you try to treat them as waves, you can only measure the properties of the waves. The problem is that you can’t get both at the same exact time because you have to choose which state you measure. However, what you can do is create <a href=\"http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/quantum/style_a/packets.html\" target=\"_blank\">a wave packet</a>, where you should get a good, rough approximation of how the block behaves in both states. In other words, measurement of quantum systems is very possible.</p>
<p>All right, so this covers the Uncertainty Principle mixup, what about the other two concepts? The biggest problem in physics today is the lack of unification between the noisy quantum mechanics on the subatomic scale and the ordered patterns of general relativity. String theory and the very popular but nearly impossible to test many worlds theory tries to explain the effects of the basic forces that shape the universe on all scales in terms of different dimensions or leaks from other universes. So when Tallis says that it’s still 40 years and we don’t know which one is right, then piles on his misunderstanding of quantum mechanics on top of Wallace’s seeming inability to tell the difference between multiverses and string theory, he ends up with the mess above. We get a paradox where there isn’t one and scope creep from particle physics into cosmology. Not quite a ringing endorsement of philosophy in physics so far. And then Tallis makes it worse…</p>
<blockquote><p>The attempt to fit consciousness into the material world, usually by identifying it with activity in the brain, has failed dismally, if only because there is no way of accounting for the fact that certain nerve impulses are supposed to be conscious (of themselves or of the world) while the overwhelming majority (physically essentially the same) are not. In short, physics does not allow for the strange fact that matter reveals itself to material objects (such as physicists).</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, a grab bag of not even wrong is supposed to sell us on the idea that a philosopher could help where our tools are pushed to their limits. Considering that Tallis <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/12/14/the-curious-case-of-a-skeptical-bait-and-switch/\">dismisses the entire idea that neuroscience as a discipline has any merit</a>, no wonder that he proclaims that we don’t have any clue of what consciousness is from a biological perspective. The fact is that we do have lots of clues. Certain patterns of brain activity are strongly associated with a person being aware of his or her environment, being able to meaningfully interact, and store and recall information as needed. It’s hardly the full picture of course, but it’s a lot more than Tallis thinks it is. His bizarre claim that scientists consider some nerve pulses to be conscious while the majority are said not to be is downright asinine. Just about every paper on the study of the conscious mind in a peer reviewed, high quality journal refer to consciousness as a product of the entire brain. </p>
<p>The rest of his argument is just a meaningless, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism\" target=\"_blank\">vitalist</a> word salad. If brain activity is irrelevant to consciousness, why do healthy living people have certain paterns while those who had massive brain injuries have different ones depending on the site of injury? Why do all those basic brain wave patterns repeat again and again in test after test? Just for the fun of seeing themselves on an EEG machine’s output? And what does it mean that it’s a surprising fact that we can perceive matter around us? Once again, hardly a serious testament to the usefulness of philosophers in science because so far all we got is meaningless questions accusing scientists of being unable to solve problems that aren’t problems by using a couple of buzzwords incorrectly, haphazardly cobbling bits of pieces of different theories into an overreaching statement that initially sounds well researched, but means pretty much nothing. Well, this is at least when we don’t have Tallis outright dismissing the science without explaining what’s wrong with it…</p>
<blockquote><p>Recent attempts to explain how the universe came out of nothing, which rely on questionable notions such as spontaneous fluctuations in a quantum vacuum, the notion of gravity as negative energy, and the inexplicable free gift of the laws of nature waiting in the wings for the moment of creation, reveal conceptual confusion beneath mathematical sophistication.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we get a double whammy of Tallis getting the science wrong and deciding that he doesn’t like the existing ideas because they don’t pass his smell test. He’s combining competing ideas to declare them inconsistent within a unified framework, seeingly unaware that the hypotheses he’s ridiculing aren’t complimentary by design. Yes, we don’t know how the universe was created, all we have <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/01/20/an-appeasement-of-cosmic-proportions/\">is evidence of the Big Bang</a> and we want to know exactly what banged and how. This is why we have competing theories about quantum fluxes, virtual particles, branes, <a href=\"http://\">and all sorts of other mathematical ideas created in a giant brainstorm</a>, waiting to be tested for any hint of a real application to observable phenomena. Pop sci magazines might declare that math proved that a stray quantum particle caused the Big Bang or that we were all vomited out by some giant black hole, or <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/07/18/mining-physics-for-grounbreaking-papers/\">are living in the event horizon of one</a>, but in reality, that math is just one idea. So yes, Tallis is right about the confusion under the algebra, but he’s wrong about why it exists.</p>
<p>And here’s the bottom line. If the philosopher trying to make the case for this profession’s need for inclusion into the realms of physics and neuroscience doesn’t understand what the problems are, what the fields do, and how the fields work, why would we even want to hear how he could help? If you read his entire column, he never does explain how, but really, after all his whoppers and not even wrongs, do you care? Philosophers are useful when you want to define a process or wrap your head around where to start your research on a complex topic, like how to create an artificial intelligence. But past that, hard numbers and experiments are required to figure out the truth, otherwise, all we have are debates about semantics which at some point may well turn into questions of what it means to exist in the first place. Not to say that this last part is not a debate worth having, but it doesn’t add much to a field where we can actually measure and calculate a real answer to a real question and apply what we learn to dive even further.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F29%2Fwhy-scientists-really-dont-need-the-input-of-philosophers-like-raymond-tallis%2F&title=why%20scientists%20really%20don%E2%80%99t%20need%20the%20input%20of%20philosophers%20like%20raymond%20tallis\" id=\"wpa2a_20\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/29/why-scientists-really-dont-need-the-input-of-philosophers-like-raymond-tallis/#comments" "1e57350ccd54bee4162b949324865c2e") (30 (20930 47205 797477) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/28/why-the-new-star-trek-was-doomed-to-trekkie-hatred/" "why the new star trek was doomed to trekkie hatred" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 28 May 2013 22:28:57 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/enterprise_vs_dreadnaught_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"enterprise vs. dreadnought\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16728\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>A good swath of the geek part of the internet is lit up with fury about Star Trek Into Darkness. It’s manifested on the familiar nerd hubs like <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/05/star-trek-into-darkness-carol-marcus/\" target=\"_blank\">Wired</a>, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/star-trek-into-darkness-impressive-but-imperfect/\" target=\"_blank\">Ars</a>, and <a href=\"http://io9.com/star-trek-into-darkness-the-spoiler-faq-508927844\" target=\"_blank\">io9</a>, especially io9, which is downright incandescent with rage about the movie’s choice of villain. Numerous calls have been made for the heads of J.J. Abrams and his crew on platters, to soothe the angry Gods of Trek, while fans of the franchise are busy offering ideas for what would’ve made the movie better, which, surprise surprise, involve following the canon of the original series and the spin-offs. But this was a given when you consider the source material and the fan base. You can’t reboot a franchise simply by continuing the story arcs already decades in the making, you can’t make an exciting movie that focuses on tedious exopolitical negotiations in the neutral zone, and you will ruffle some feathers when you try to boldly go (or go at all) where the franchise has never gone before.</p>
<p>For example, one of the big complaints about Abrams’ vision of Star Trek is the militarization of the Federation’s fleet. But here’s the thing. It’s a fleet of spaceships that might face adversarial life forms (like the Romulans and Klingons), the ships are armed with lasers and missiles, and a botched first encounter can turn a peaceful delegation of explorers into a military incursion. So it’s kind of hard to blame Abrams for seeing the potential of the Federation to wage war, and in dire circumstances, use ships that were once meant to explore the galaxy for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_projection\" target=\"_blank\">force projection</a>, as the Enterprise is used in Into Darkness. And of course there’s the commercial consideration. A sci-fi movie sells best when there’s war involved because that makes a good popcorn flick that’s going to attract big crowds. People generally struggle with peaceful meditations on life from all those little green men, and often don’t try to apply it back to the world they inhabit.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, Star Trek was supposed to rise above these commercial considerations but today, sci-fi is a hard sell. For studios, it’s either popcorn munching military science fiction or another rom-com because they’re a business and movies are expensive to make, especially those which require lots and lots of special effects. If you’re a die-hard Trekkie, you’re going to have to make some concessions to people who live outside your bubble and really couldn’t care about all the intricate stories to which you dedicated countless hours. Who knows, they might like the idea so much, they go back and rediscover what you saw in the source material. But if you’re going for mass audiences, something has to give and compromises have to be made. And here is where we run into the biggest complaint of them all, that Abrams was recycling deep material from the original rather than creating something completely new out of it. Unfortunately, this is an area in which every reboot director is facing a lose-lose proposition by the nature of the project.</p>
<p>Had Into Darkness essentially been an updated Wrath of Khan, Abrams would’ve been pilloried for simply giving the classic a coat of fresh paint, just like io9 was savaging him for using classic material and inverting it, with the writer sounding nearly apoplectic with fan rage. If the movie’s plot resembled nothing ever seen or done on Star Trek, the Trekkies would’ve been infuriated that they got their Star Trek without anything that made it like Star Trek, asking why Abrams did not make and references to the original and just borrowed the names, ships, and logos to make something completely different under the same brand name. That’s the nature of a reboot. You won’t be able to please the fans either way unless you simply continue where the last episode of their franchise left off without missing a beat, and that sort of defeats the whole idea of a reboot in the first place. Into Darkness was a fun movie, it had its moments, and it was technically very, very well executed for what it was supposed to be. And at least it has people interested in sci-fi, which is more than we could say for many past and upcoming sci-fi flicks…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F28%2Fwhy-the-new-star-trek-was-doomed-to-trekkie-hatred%2F&title=why%20the%20new%20star%20trek%20was%20doomed%20to%20trekkie%20hatred\" id=\"wpa2a_22\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/28/why-the-new-star-trek-was-doomed-to-trekkie-hatred/#comments" "64750cc616a6609d17e291f0428b6650") (29 (20930 47205 796186) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/18/from-virtual-reality-pioneer-to-anti-singularitarian/" "from virtual reality pioneer to anti-singularitarian" "Greg Fish" "Sat, 18 May 2013 14:21:19 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/future_dystopia_600.jpg?resize=600%2C330\" alt=\"future dystopia\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16723\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>This is not the first time Jaron Lanier gets a post on Weird Things, in fact we met him before as he quickly <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/08/11/when-philosophy-meets-artificial-intelligence/\">went off the rails in describing AI</a>, then became more incoherent <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/08/31/jaron-lanier-vs-history-and-the-singularitarians/\">while bemoaning all social media as a dehumanizing waste</a>, all the while trying to pick a fight with the Singularitarian version of a machine-directed utopia. Now, the former virtual reality pioneer has <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/book-review-who-owns-the-future-7000015123/\" target=\"_blank\">moved on to a book length rumination on how technology is killing the middle class</a> by eliminating jobs. And as per his current modus operandi, he starts off with a tiny kernel of a reasonable statement, and proceeds to strap it to the Hyperbole Rocket and launch it into deep space. Is it true that a new software package or a robot might make your job obsolete? Yes, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/02/24/how-do-you-future-proof-your-job-prospects/\">it absolutely can</a>. But does the technology prevent you from getting a new job? No, it doesn’t because the reasons why you’re going to have trouble finding work in a globalized economy <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/11/01/robots-just-might-take-your-job-and-keep-it/\">are more political than technological</a>, and it’s short term greed, partisan bickering, and ignorance of the powers that be at fault.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Lanier’s opening salvo says that when Kodak was at the height of its market domination of personal photography, it employed more than 140,000 people. Now, he says, the face of personal photography is Instagram which has only 13 employees. Therefore, jobs were lost because of technology, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.\" target=\"_blank\">Q.E.D.</a> Um, no. First and foremost, Kodak died the slow and painful death it did because it first refused to adapt to a world of digital photography, then couldn’t, as it wasted years assuming that as long as they can at least sell the tools to develop all those digital photos on glossy paper, they’ll be fine. They never even thought that paper may be useless for most of the pictures being taken today as social media and smartphones took off. Secondly, as much as tech blogs may have hyped it, Instagram was not \"the new face of photography.\" Take away cheap, mainstream digital photography and it couldn’t exist. It was a distribution network, a network that Kodak could’ve built. But instead of innovating, it slowly withered away.</p>
<p>All right, so what happened to those tens of thousands of people laid off by Kodak? Well, they could find new jobs because among those laid off were managers, assistants, chemists, and IT specialists who could’ve applied their skills in other companies, doing other things, and I assure you that there aren’t 140,000 middle class workers out there who haven’t worked a day since a Kodak executive pink slipped them to meet the quarterly numbers. Eeyore would’ve been more optimistic about their future than Lanier, but then again, for optimism, Lanier would’ve needed to see technology as something more than a nefarious tool to use and abuse the populace. Where the disciples of Ray Kurzweil <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2011/02/15/techno-utopianism-makes-it-to-time-magazine/\">see immorality, sunshine  rainbows, and unicorns</a> frolicking in the meadows, he seems to see impending chaos, destruction, and socioeconomic dystopia adapted from the pages of very gloomy science fiction. And yet, Lanier plans to live with this grim future. For a fee of course. You see, in his version of if-you-can’t-beat-them-join-them, he’s suggesting that if social media sites use our data to survive, they should pay us for it, and that’s how we will start solving the impending job crisis caused by these evil machines taking our place.</p>
<p>Certainly, while being paid to mess around on Facebook would be a great deal, the problem is that paying all of its users even pennies a day would leave the company insolvent. Social media sites simply don’t make all that much money because <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/10/06/so-how-is-that-social-web-working-out-for-facebook/\">they fell short of the promises they give a lot of advertisers</a> when it comes to moving product for them. All the data you submit simply won’t give them nearly as good of a picture of who you are and what you like as Lanier and so many tech pundits think it does when they fall for the company’s wild claims. In fact, predicting what a person will do based on his or her social media footprint <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/09/02/trying-to-predict-the-future-one-stat-at-a-time/\">is an exercise in warm reading</a>. There’s plenty of detail to go on, but a lot of this detail may be useless and lead to broad conclusions or incorrect recommendations. Advertisers are not moving nearly as much product as they thought they would, people are giving them incomplete and misleading information, social media makes money but not as much as it thought it could, and now Lanier wants this struggling ecosystem to pay its users for making it profitably mediocre? Does he also have a bridge to sell us?</p>
<p>Yes, the world is changing. Yes, technology is doing things it’s never done before, and it’s now taking us places where we’ve never been, physically, socially, and economically. But instead of trying to figure out a way to productively deal with with the change of pace, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/09/05/waiting-for-the-corporate-messiahs-to-save-us/\">by investing in R&D and shifting more jobs into innovation and design</a>, while letting robots do more of the execution, people like Lanier want to take their ball and go home. The problem is that they can’t. Arguing if our sprawling data centers and powerful software needs to be scaled back and dumbed down is like protesting against the wind blowing. You can waste your oxygen telling it to slow down or go in a direction you’d personally find more acceptable, or you can raise some wind generators for an extra kilowatt hour or two to take advantage of the situation. At no point has any civilization ever grown or met a challenge by saying \"no, we’re done,\" or demanding payment to participate in new ideas, new economies, and new social structures. Many have died and stagnated doing exactly that, which is why we shouldn’t take Lanier’s technophobic musings seriously.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F18%2Ffrom-virtual-reality-pioneer-to-anti-singularitarian%2F&title=from%20virtual%20reality%20pioneer%20to%20anti-singularitarian\" id=\"wpa2a_24\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/18/from-virtual-reality-pioneer-to-anti-singularitarian/#comments" "00b8c13baad88f041d8949ab898fadb9") (28 (20930 47205 794688) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/16/psychologists-convenience-samples-and-really-shoddy-popular-science-writing/" "psychologists, convenience samples, and really shoddy popular science writing" "Greg Fish" "Thu, 16 May 2013 20:50:20 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/exposed_brain_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"exposed brain\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16717\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Psychology has occasionally been called \"the study of college undergraduates\" and while that would usually be a joke in the psych department, a few writers are raising red flags that it’s too common of a practice <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/05/weird_psychology_social_science_researchers_rely_too_much_on_western_college.single.html\" traget=\"_blank\">and might be affecting the quality of the science</a>. The study they chose to highlight? A survey trying to make the link between someone’s first sexual experience and what sexual activity follows based on 319 heterosexual college students who started having sex only about two years prior to the study and were asked to describe their intimate activities with some very positive and some very negative adjectives from a proscribed list. While the critics ask why the population was so homogeneous and the responses were so limited, this actually makes a lot of sense. If you’re not sure of your hypothesis, you want to have the most uniform samples you can find and limit inherently qualitative feedback into more quantitative form. From there on, you can test if the theory holds for more sexually experienced and diverse populations. So why are science writers harping on a perfectly legitimate, well done hypothesis fishing study?</p>
<p>Probably because it’s recent and it found that the students’ first sexual experience tended to be indicative of how they’d describe their future ones. And when limited to the population studied, it does make sense. Many of them are still relatively wet behind the ears and having finally had a real sexual encounter, they’re wondering what others will be like and comparing it to their first as they get more and more experience because it’s usually one of their few points of reference. At the same time, however, as the first experience fades into memory, new highlights come to take its place and a terrible first time gets forgotten in favor of the last mind-blowing experience and that might go on to color future encounters. We could also wonder about couples who lost their virginity to each other and haven’t had sex with anyone else. So why didn’t the researchers take cases like this into account? Well, they’d be outside the scope of the study, which basically just points out the obvious that yes, there’s a mental link between what you thought of your first time and your future preferences and expectations, as it applies to the sample population.</p>
<p>And that last phrase is really the crux of the matter because while human sexuality is so diverse and complex that questions about it could easily fuel centuries of studies and experiments, the pool of people willing to be studied is limited and the external factors they’d bring into the study makes it complicated to tease out complex and minute differences that might hint at something more, something that merits further research. College undergraduates are easy to recruit, easy to find close to the researchers’ labs, and fairly easy to homogenize, so they make for a simple, convenient set of test subjects in pilot studies. They’re a classic go-to convenience sample, and if you want to study special populations, you’ll go and study those special populations when you have the resources to do so. It’s just not fair to expect a narrow study to account for everything and use it a s springboard to pontificate on the limited utility of convenience sampling in basic psychology published for the public. And here the media has to take some heat as well.</p>
<p>How many pop sci writers just copy and paste the press release? How many of them wrote click bait headlines that sound as if an exhaustive study settled the question of just how special your first time is to you and what role it plays in your sex life? And how many of them trying their best to be contrarians put words in the researchers’ mouths and criticized them for making claims not actually made by the study? My guess? Quite a few. In fact, the links to a critical review of three other studies in the referenced critique were papers uncritically hyped by the media to become the viral stories they became. We can certainly argue about how much psychologists are relying on convenience samples of white, college educated students in the West, and what this does to the field as a whole. However, if the initial studies seem to be suffering from a bad sample or are way too limited to be applied outside of a very narrow socioeconomic group, the media klaxon is making the problem a hundred times worse. For writers to then wag their finger at the scientists, saying \"tsk, tsk on your sampling techniques\" without acknowledging that their colleagues have been running away with inconclusive and narrow studies for years is very disingenuous.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F16%2Fpsychologists-convenience-samples-and-really-shoddy-popular-science-writing%2F&title=psychologists%2C%20convenience%20samples%2C%20and%20really%20shoddy%20popular%20science%20writing\" id=\"wpa2a_26\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/16/psychologists-convenience-samples-and-really-shoddy-popular-science-writing/#comments" "ac8deb64e9737866620a1706361c6c49") (27 (20930 47205 791545) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/13/conspiracy-writers-rediscover-the-cias-sex-slaves/" "conspiracy writers rediscover the =?utf-8?Q?cia=E2=80=99s?= sex slaves" "Greg Fish" "Mon, 13 May 2013 21:42:25 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/barefoot_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"barefoot\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16142\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Conspiracy theories about mind control are nothing new. In fact, I’ve lost count how many books from Jim Marrs and David Icke purport some sort of mind control beam, or wave, or program by the nefarious Illuminati altering our consciousness so we become mere puppets to the will of an evil intelligence. And considering how many of them are out there, they’re getting harder to sell, even to an audience primed to hear more stories about sinister mind control experiments which sound pulled right form the pages of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illuminatus!_Trilogy\" target=\"_blank\">Illuminatus! Trilogy</a>, so if you’re a conspiracy theorist with a book to sell, you have to spice it up somehow, and sex slavery seems to be emerging as the new trend in getting people’s attention. A good example is <a href=\"http://www.theconspiracyreview.com/1/post/2013/04/mind-controlled-sex-slaves-and-the-cia.html\" target=\"_blank\">a new book from the Conspiracy Journal</a> which builds itself on the story of Cathy O’Brien, a woman who claimed that she was a victim of the CIA’s more sinister MKULTRA subproject codenamed Monarch in a Satanic Panic era potboiler called Trance Formation of America. Yes dear readers, sex can sell anything…</p>
<p>Now, where do we begin? When you open <a href=\"http://ia600502.us.archive.org/10/items/TranceformationOfAmerica/tranceformation_america.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">an online version</a> of O’Brien’s book, you’ll be quickly hammered by countless attempts to prove that a) mind control exists, b) no one talks about it to hide how effective it is from you, thus engaging in a form of mind control, and c) because there are reams of paperwork showing that the CIA experimented with mind control, it means we have to believe O’Brien and her stories of CIA sex slaves created for the pleasure of malevolent big wigs whose cooperation America wanted to secure during the Cold War. Oy. Here’s the problem in this line of reasoning. The kernel of truth here is that the CIA did attempt to experiment with all sorts of mind control ideas to teach its spies, but just about all of them were spectacular failures so one of the big reasons why so many were kept hush hush is because they flatly didn’t work and the agency didn’t want anyone to know how badly they were struggling with anything other than drugging a person and very unevenly interrogating him or her in an intoxicated state.</p>
<p>But instead of showing how mind control can work, O’Brien simply claims that absence of a well understood or recognized form of mind control means that it must exist, then goes on to equate tightly controlled state propaganda with mind control. That doesn’t really work. Mind control has the connotation that there’s a device, or a chemical cocktail that will make you do the bidding of whoever has it. Propaganda is basically brainwashing through tight control of information. That’s not the same thing, and it relies on a totalitarian regime that could control everything its citizens see and hear, a regime like North Korea. And even there the total control breaks down when an errant signal gets picked up on the radio or an outlawed internet connection is established that lets the regime’s prisoner-citizens see into the outside world. Having lived in a real authoritarian state, I can tell you that America today is far too permissive to exercise that kind of “mind control by disinformation,” unless you can prove that the entire Western world is being brainwashed, a claim that requires a very significant burden of proof and for some political miracles to occur.</p>
<p>And this is where the <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/01/08/the-bizarre-mindset-of-conspiracy-theorists/\">mind controlled CIA/Illuminati/Builderberg sex slaves</a> come in. They are the reward for those rich, famous, and powerful enough to advance the New World Order’s agenda, though one wonders since when the rich and powerful, for whom money is no object, became so easily bribed with sex. They can easily charm or buy their way into women’s panties as shown by countless scandals of exactly that happening. Even more bizarre to me is that stories of female sexual slaves are plentiful while virtually nothing exists on male sex slaves. This doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Surely a global network of thousands of power players must feature straight women with an appetite for lithe young men, or homosexual fatcats. So why do we hear nothing at all about them? Of course there’s more. O’Brien’s vivid recollections of abuse at the hands of all sorts of foreign diplomats, power brokers, and Satanic cultists — oh we’ll be back to that, don’t you worry for a second that we won’t — came to her through hypnosis, like the memories of alien abductees though a process we’ve seen before, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/06/22/a-comprehensive-look-at-alien-abductions/\">a process which has no scientific basis</a>.</p>
<p>So in the end, what we have is a mix of Satanic Panic ritual sexual abuse, misuse of hypnosis on highly suggestible subjects, and conspiracy theories borrowing from <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2008/10/09/new-world-order-old-world-news/\">the Taxil Hoax</a>. And that’s a perfect mix in the 1990s, when the tabloids are on fire with the idea of Satanic subliminal music, and wild claims of countless children being tortured and future Miss Teen Americas raped in the catacombs of cultists acting on behalf of the Devil, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/09/13/weekend-satanists-for-jesus/\">and greedy con men are writing confessions of their supposed guilt in the nasty undertaking</a>. Isn’t it odd that O’Brien’s tale fits just oh so very perfectly with the predominant money making conspiracy literature of the time, literature quickly shown to be either untrustworthy or outright made up and sold as real accounts? And shouldn’t we wonder why perfectly these calibrated salacious rumors and supposed real tales of power, sex, magic, and aliens should be trusted when they’re repackaged to sell to us a second time, a few decades after they were last popular? Human trafficking like the type shown in Taken is bad enough without money-making boogeymen like the Repotoids, CIA, and the Illuminati. Maybe we should keep them out of a very real and very dire problem? Just a thought…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F13%2Fconspiracy-writers-rediscover-the-cias-sex-slaves%2F&title=conspiracy%20writers%20rediscover%20the%20cia%E2%80%99s%20sex%20slaves\" id=\"wpa2a_28\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/13/conspiracy-writers-rediscover-the-cias-sex-slaves/#comments" "5354834d20b8acd682c5c66e9ed39d82") (26 (20930 47205 790075) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/07/when-you-measure-for-the-sake-of-measuring/" "when you measure for the sake of measuring" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 07 May 2013 21:52:38 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/counting_the_days_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"counting the days\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16707\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>One of Warren Buffet’s most famous pieces of advice to analytic managers is to measure the things that matter, not just the things that are measurable. It’s a lesson lost on Chris Dancy, the IT professional whose claim to fame <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/02/quantified-work/all/\" target=\"_blank\">is measuring every second of his workday</a>. Every second. I meant it. Every call, meeting, bathroom break, document edit, e-mail reply, and work tweet has a special color coded entry in Google Calendar so his bosses will know exactly what he was doing at 1:13 PM last Tuesday and appreciate his ability to document every moment at the office. Just one thing is left out on his mind-bendingly detailed calendars — how much time he wastes on his pointless endeavor. Seriously, if your boss read that post and thinks this is a good idea, I would highly suggest firing up your resume and passing it along to some good friends because you’re working for someone who doesn’t want to manage employees, you’re working for someone who wants to manage robots and look at dashboards to make pretty reports for executives.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Factory work can be easily measured in terms of how much time is spent on a part, how much time is idle, how many widgets are out the door each day, and other very hard metrics that can track how a factory lives and breathes. Service oriented positions like IT have a lot of soft elements to them. Whereas parts have to be manufactured to exact specifications, an important code block can be written in many ways. Sending a 1,000 sprockets to quality control by the end of the day means meeting several orders on schedule. Sending 44 tweets about the newest app throughout the day might mean a few sales, or might mean nothing at all. You get a lot of numbers that don’t actually mean anything by using Dancy’s methodology. Yeah, he goes to a lot of meetings and does a lot of IT paperwork. So what? How many times did he have to do it again because it didn’t provide enough detail to developers? How would the developers rate it and would they rather have someone else do it next time? How thorough was his testing?</p>
<p>If you want decent metrics from your IT department, you have to look at quality of what it sends out to be used. How many people like the products? How many would recommend them to their friends? How much are they willing to pay for them? How many units were sold? What was the overall return on investment and how did the expenses break down overall (labor vs. tools)? Or what’s the turnaround time for fixing a defect? How many defects did internal QA workers catch versus how many were reported by users after shipping? Those are important metrics and they should matter a lot more to IT management than how many times someone like Darcy had to go to the bathroom or how many pages of documents he or she wrote that day. So the idea that if some aspect of your day can be measured it should be, and your bosses will appreciate you just going right ahead and measuring it for them, is absurd to put it gently. Ultimately what matters is what you produce so even if you’re extremely busy and making the most of out your day, if you produce nothing really useful, none of your intricate daily calendars will save you from the HR’s chopping block, and don’t you dare blame that on not measuring your day enough.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F07%2Fwhen-you-measure-for-the-sake-of-measuring%2F&title=when%20you%20measure%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20measuring\" id=\"wpa2a_30\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/07/when-you-measure-for-the-sake-of-measuring/#comments" "880898e09850438858f29049d27dd709") (25 (20930 47205 786849) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/04/yes-sometimes-its-good-to-write-for-free/" "yes, sometimes =?utf-8?Q?it=E2=80=99s?= good to write for free" "Greg Fish" "Sat, 04 May 2013 14:43:00 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/old_typewriter_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"old typewriter\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16702\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>In March, freelance journalist Nate Thayer is incandescent with rage. It wasn’t that he’s trying to make his living by writing and no one’s paying attention. In fact The Atlantic is knocking on his door and asking to run condensed versions of one of his blog posts. No, the big problem <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/nate-thayer-vs-the-atlantic-writing-for-free.html\" target=\"_blank\">is that they were not offering to pay him for it</a>, and their once upon a time talks of a $125,000 per year retainer never really came to anything because the editor working on it was killed in Iraq. Thayer was livid, saying that he can’t feed his kids, can’t pay for his internet connection, and can barely pay his rent, so how dare the publication offer him nothing but exposure. Maybe it was wise that he didn’t take the deal because it would’ve made <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/nate-thayer-atlantic-charged-with-plagiarism.html\" target=\"_blank\">the charges of partial plagiarism for the post</a> in question all the more embarrassing. But charges and controversies aside, when I came across a reference to Thayer’s debacle, I thought it would be a good idea to highlight what this incident shows about new vs. old media and why journalists will find themselves fewer in number.</p>
<p>Here’s the important thing about selling your services. Just because you need to make a certain amount of money to pay rent, doesn’t mean that what you’re trying to sell is worth that much to the entity interested in buying. Professional journalists who worked back when there weren’t any blogs around to break news, and newspapers were arbiters of what was must-read, are used to being able to take their time, work on a story, and get paid good money for their efforts. But this wonderful world of overseas posts, expense accounts, and large retainers is now gone. People like the immediacy of breaking news through social media and TV, and then in depth summaries and investigations as the situation settles down. And they get this from virtually everywhere free because anyone can break stories. The result? News is cheap. So how will The Atlantic cover a six figure retainer for someone producing stories that aren’t necessarily that valuable and won’t generate enough traffic to pay for themselves at such sky high rates?</p>
<p>On top of that, exposure is a good thing. I’ve had one of my posts reproduced by io9, of course with my permission. It gave the blog more credibility and more traffic, which helped a syndication deal I had at the time because the payouts were based on the number of readers. Being picked up by Time Warner’s news sites was also a huge boon, and although few of the publications for which I’ve written sent me cold, hard cash, the traffic and exposure for my work made this blog turn a profit. At no time was I laboring under the delusion that I was going to make six figures for my pop sci writing because pop sci articles are a dime a dozen. The web is positively lousy with them. The money from the blog was simply a way to help with rent while doing some freelance IT work and if it became something more, great. For Thayer to expect anything more out of a blog nowadays is simply unrealistic, and his fury at being offered free exposure sounds really out of touch. If his kids are going hungry and his rent is going unpaid, he needs to find another way to make money because let me tell you from experience, this writing stuff doesn’t pay well.</p>
<p>That said, there will always be some room for investigative journalists and researchers who will curate what’s circling around social media, track down sources, and find out real stories, but it’s unlikely that they won’t rely on the traffic their stories generate for their salaries and donations from readers who want them to keep going and appreciate the time it takes to create a massive, long form expose. But again, their stories better be gripping, fascinating, and start debates on a national scale. An abbreviated review of North Korea policy doesn’t necessarily fit that bill while parsing leaked information about top secret drone strikes does. The future of journalism is very savvy writers who act as their own editors and work in partnership with publications, not as their employees, focused not just on their stories but the economics of their storytelling. If former big shot journalists like Thayer don’t know that, they really need to wake up and smell the coffee as they read through the Twitter feed, looking for material for their next post…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F04%2Fyes-sometimes-its-good-to-write-for-free%2F&title=yes%2C%20sometimes%20it%E2%80%99s%20good%20to%20write%20for%20free\" id=\"wpa2a_32\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/04/yes-sometimes-its-good-to-write-for-free/#comments" "092fee225225895340974d07b0aa252b") (24 (20930 47205 785097) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/30/why-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science/" "why we need to keep politicians away from science" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 21:21:43 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/microcosm_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"microcosm\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15760\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Really, the politicians in office today, science, and technology simply don’t mix. We have years and years of bills and their behavior proving this. From <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/08/31/the-peter-principle-stacks-the-deck-against-science/\">vapid remarks about science</a>, to serious debate about <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/06/19/cyber-security-youre-doing-it-very-wrong/\">an internet kill switch</a>, to <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/05/15/how-we-shouldnt-fix-research-grant-problems/\">inviting woefully unqualified people to judge what should be funded by the NSF</a>, it’s as if our lawmakers are trying to live <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/02/14/calling-all-boss-haters/\">the stereotype of over-confident managers who think they’re experts at all things because they can talk a big game</a>. It would be amusing were they not in a position to actually change how science is being funded, and churn out ridiculous proposal after ridiculous proposal. The latest volley of this oblivious ineptitude is the bill from Lamar Smith (yes, R-TX, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/05/18/the-state-of-texas-vs-science-and-education/\">a real shocker</a>, I know) which lays out <a href=\"http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2013/04/us-lawmaker-proposes-new-criteri-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">what sort of projects the NSF should be funding</a> and in the process basically discards anything that’s not an applied military or a medical project, negating the entire point of basic research and eviscerating basic research funding not obfuscated to look like a future treatment, weapon, or infosec system.</p>
<p>Basic science is done because we’re curious about something and we don’t know what sorts of applications or spin-offs it might have. Maybe there will be none. Maybe we’ll discover something as incredibly useful as lasers. Maybe there will be no direct benefit but in the process, we’ll build something that will change the world, like the world wide web being derived from a project meant to help particle physicists share data from particle collider results at CERN. We just don’t know, which is why we try to study all these things, and the results provide more than enough ROI as direct applications and spin-offs are commercialized. However, a lot of people will not see it that way, insisting that if something can’t be on the market within a few years, or used to kill bad guys half a world away, it’s a waste of money. And not only do they see it that way, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/03/10/why-so-many-said-that-apollo-wasnt-worth-it/\">they refuse to even try to understand how basic research and the scientific process work</a>. They also <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/02/23/why-scientists-wont-be-elected-in-the-u-s/\">do not care for, or understand scientists</a>, deluding themselves with myths about their lifestyles.</p>
<p>And this is how we get the Lamar Smiths of the world. His constituents truly believe that a typical scientist could never make it in \"a real job,\" and lives off of government welfare in the form of an enormous grant, handed over like a blank check from the NSF. The facts that scientists actually make something like $55,000 per year on average, have to deal with the NSF approving only a small fraction of all the grant applications they receive (below 10% in many fields and up to 20% in some others), and generally to already well established scientists, and that they can be fired for not being top of their field, do not register with them. It’s so sadly ironic that people who can easily out-earn scientists in their lifetimes and can keep their jobs if they’re at least mediocre, are deriding woefully underpaid professionals who can be fired for not being in the top 10% of their discipline and have to pay their own salaries through fundraising and political savvy. And it’s an insult to injury when said people turn scientifically illiterate politicians into their attack dogs.</p>
<p>But this is what happens when people are allowed, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2011/04/03/yes-education-is-good-for-you-stop-whining/\">and even encouraged</a>, to remain glib and as incurious as they please by politicians and public figures who rush to pat them on the back and give them a gold star for just being who they are. The current push to structure basic education around standardized testing rather than discovery, curiosity, and career orientation isn’t helping either. If we just let kids find out what fascinates them and feed their curiosity with key subjects that will let them pursue it further, they’ll learn the reading, the math, and the history involved to perform well on whatever standardized tests you’ll give them. After all, any field requires a solid command of basic literacy and mathematical competence to fully understand. But that requires the effort to restructure how the education system works, basically, giving a shit and trying to do something about it, to put it bluntly. However, by the choices a lot of people are making in their elected officials, and their support of said officials’ scientific illiteracy and hostility to science, I’m willing to bet that not a whole lot of the required shits are being given on average…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F04%2F30%2Fwhy-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science%2F&title=why%20we%20need%20to%20keep%20politicians%20away%20from%20science\" id=\"wpa2a_34\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/30/why-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science/#comments" "00d80350cc16bb5194df61f5b214d601") (23 (20930 47205 780739) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/26/why-colonizing-another-planet-really-shouldnt-be-a-reality-show/" "why colonizing another planet really =?utf-8?Q?shouldn=E2=80=99t?= be a reality show" "Greg Fish" "Fri, 26 Apr 2013 13:36:30 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mars_one_habitat_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"mars one habitat\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16691\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>The Mars One project generated a good deal of media attention by promising to fund its efforts to colonize the Red Planet with a reality show which would follow the crews on their one way trip and chronicle their efforts at living on another world. Now while this sounds like the most far out premise for the next season of Survivor, it’s a terrible idea for an actual mission. If you’ve ever seen a reality show, you know that producers don’t really cast people as much as they cast the stereotypes they think will give viewers the most bang for their buck. If Gordon Ramsey didn’t go on epic tirades over every dish not up to his par, slamming trays, punching the food, and having fits of apoplectic rage that would put a banshee to shame, you’d be left with a fairly boring hour of TV that would be more at home at the Food Network than on a broadcast channel. Could you imagine Hell’s Spacecraft as a real mission to extend human cities to a new planet?</p>
<p>And that’s not even getting to the fact that Mars One is asking anyone to apply for what should be a mission for extremely well trained professionals with numerous actual space flights on their resumes, and <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/applications-open-for-mars-one-the-first-human-space-colony/\" target=\"_blank\">charging as much as $38</a> just to look at an application, and that it will rely on new rockets built by SpaceX to do the actual work, as well as the fact that it’s spending no time at all trying to address <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/03/02/why-a-flyby-of-mars-may-not-live-up-to-its-intention/\">all the problems with flying to Mars in capsules</a>? At the end of the day this has to be either a scam, or just a really terrible idea that will never pan out. Make no mistake, I’m not saying that we shouldn’t try to colonize Mars or that we can’t pull it off if we really devoted plenty of time, energy, and resources to it. We absolutely should and we’re probably very close to the place we need to be to safely and comfortably send crews to the Red Planet. But making reality shows out of it, raising money by promising one way trips to alien worlds, and relying on brand new technology not really meant or tested for these missions is not the way to go about it.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F04%2F26%2Fwhy-colonizing-another-planet-really-shouldnt-be-a-reality-show%2F&title=why%20colonizing%20another%20planet%20really%20shouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20a%20reality%20show\" id=\"wpa2a_36\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/26/why-colonizing-another-planet-really-shouldnt-be-a-reality-show/#comments" "0b26b54693f39a68e7a2bc92ecb1d778") (22 (20930 47205 779310) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/25/how-to-shield-yourself-in-a-vacuum-sci-fi-style/" "how to shield yourself in a vacuum, sci-fi style" "Greg Fish" "Thu, 25 Apr 2013 20:28:17 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/alien_bacteria_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"alien bacteria\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16225\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>In a fair bit of science fiction, we see advanced alien species use some sort of shielding to walk around other planets or survive being ejected into space. Something around them flickers and a protective invisible bubble is raised, protecting them from a horrible death by dehydration as all the fluid in their bodies effectively boils away. As it turns out, that’s actually possible. So far it’s only been done with fruit fly and mosquito larvae, but we apparently know how to create a shield from extreme conditions, capturing water and necessary gases trapped in a field of electrons or plasma. All you have to do is take a specimen into an electron scanning microscope and send a shower of electrons or a plasma beam at your target. The electrons and ions envelop the living specimen, creating a little, almost skin-tight biodome that contains just enough air for it to move and otherwise keep very obviously living for about an hour. So, you might ask, electromagnetic spacesuits for everybody? Well, no, not exactly. There are a few really important caveats.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the specimens are being irradiated, and the more powerful the shielding has to be, the more radiation it requires to organize itself. Humans could get radiation poisoning as their suits are being beamed onto them, or at least risk extremly dangerous exposure levels. But if you think a little cancer is worth it, there’s the issue of being trapped with your air supply. With no scrubbers, your respiration would produce dangerous level of carbon dioxide and you would die of hypoxia after about 45 minutes to an hour or so, depending, of course, on your breathing and how much of an air supply you initially had. And now might be a good time to mention that a spacesuit created by nothing but charged particles wasn’t the original goal of the research, the idea was to insulate insects so their movements could be studied in the vacuum of the electron microscope’s sample chamber, so there’s not going to be a team working on these issues in the near or far future. But at least we now know that there really is something to the electromagnetic shielding we see in sci-fi all the time, even though it would make for a lousy spacesuit…</p>

<p>Now, I’ve written a great deal about <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/tag/ancient-astronauts/\">the ancient astronaut hypothesis</a>, the idea that alien beings had profound influence on our evolution and civilization. Usually, when I did, I talked about a lack of a smoking gun for extraterrestrial meddling in our genome or our politics, and pointed out just how rare it would be for an advanced alien species with a passion for exploration to evolve close to the same time period as us, detect our planet, cross light years to get here, and have interest in doing anything on Earth to cover the scientific basics. But what about another line of evidence from ancient astronaut believers? According to them pictures of weird beings and stories of all sorts of bizarre creatures, monsters, and mysterious chariots in the sky must point to visitations, an assertion countered by skeptics with alternative explanations that usually have to do with the religious art commonly produced by the civilizations in question or pointing out the believers’ all too tenuous grasp of the historical facts and games of confirmation bias.</p>
<p>However, there’s another idea that seems to be missing. Our ancestors wrote fiction and were every bit as creative as we are. In fact, we have records of jokes that date to nearly 4,000 years ago and epic sagas that are more than a thousand years old. Fun fact, the oldest known joke in human history is a fart joke. The second? A joke about women wearing nothing but fishnets for the visual benefit of a pharaoh. The oldest European joke? A bait and switch riddle that seemed to be describing a penis. Yes, humanity hasn’t changed all that much when it comes to humor, I know. And that’s precisely the point. We shouldn’t take everything we see from the past literally like ancient astronaut believers, although we sometimes do. The legend of King Arthur written in Perceval has inspired many true believers today to argue that there’s a real Holy Grail, just see the book on which the DaVinci Code was based: Holy Blood, Hold Grail. Despite being written as an epic fictional tale with colorful characters and fictional creatures, people take parts of it to be factual or based on fact simply because they mention other mostly or semi-fictional works.</p>
<p>So when an ancient astronaut theorist invokes ancient texts, why not ask how he or she knows if the text was meant to be taken seriously? Were the flying creatures on flaming chariots part of a religious tract meant to guide worshipers of ancient gods or was it entertaining fiction for those who ruled our first empires? How many of the soap operas meant to describe the life of the gods in ancient mythology was canon and how much were creative add-ons? When we read ancient texts on religious matters, are we confusing their versions of Bibles with their versions of the Left Behind books? We know our ancestors were creative enough to dream up gods and monsters, and mastermind engineering projects that would take decades to complete. We know there were great epics with highly fictionalized tales of past wars and natural disasters, and we know there were countless books lost as ancient libraries were burnt down by illiterate conquerors or rabid zealots. So why do ancient astronaut theorists insist on treating every artifact from the past as a record of a historical fact rather than even pretend to allow for works for art and fiction?</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F04%2F22%2Fseparating-ancient-history-from-ancient-fiction%2F&title=separating%20ancient%20history%20from%20ancient%20fiction\" id=\"wpa2a_40\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/22/separating-ancient-history-from-ancient-fiction/#comments" "45703e01258870eaa057d8e16f303e55") (20 (20928 18234 36659) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/15/the-infinitely-vast-mandatory-miltiverse/" "the infinitely vast, mandatory miltiverse?"

<p>At two events of the <a href=\"http://worldsciencefestival.com/events/cosmic_conjecture\" target=\"_blank\">Wolrd Science Festival</a> in early June,  a group of five theoretical physicists debated whether we’re living in a multiverse, and more surprisingly, if our current understanding of the cosmos all but mandates that multiple universes exist. It all goes back to the instant of the Big Bang, the femtosecond that set the rules for all reality as we know it in scientific terms. Each tiny little quantum instability and flux was stretched and projected across billions of light years to influence the shape of galaxy clusters and the tiny filaments what underpin <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/01/15/did-the-cosmological-principle-get-knocked-down/\">our mostly isotropic, homogeneous universe</a>. It’s kind of like the chaos theory saying about a flap of a butterfly’s wings eventually causing a tsunami halfway across the world, but taken to incredible extremes. We’re talking about a change in point particles becoming an archipelago a million galaxies across. So, why wouldn’t some of these instabilities become their own universes, sealed off from each other by the fabric of space and time? The inflation we just described should make this inevitable.</p>
<p>Here’s the issue. As our infant universe was inflating, it shouldn’t have spun off uniformly since that would make the fluctuations in early matter impossible and prevented the formation of stars and galaxies. It would’ve had to have large enough disruptions to kick-start other universes, or even itself be a product of another universe undergoing rapid inflation. And if one universe can inflate, so too must the rest because otherwise, inflation becomes a unique event and science is not happy with a one-off event as an explanation. Every significant process we know of happens more than once and on universal time scales of countless trillions of years, the possibilities are pretty much infinite. We should be able to see new universes bubbling up from dark voids in the fabric of space-time, over time. There might even be room to imagine a bizarre, hyper-advanced species of the far future crossing into a brand new universe as theirs dies in a void ship isolated from reality as we know it, Doctor Who-style, hopefully one that’s nothing like the Daleks.</p>
<p>Problem is, how do we prove that inflation works in more than one universe when we can’t see into the multiverse? One suggestion is that inflation basically wraps the universe into a sphere, an unbreachable, self-contained environment that seems flat to us and where trying to travel to the edge of the cosmos will result in the spaceship ending up back where it started as if it were on a Mobius strip. Simple, elegant, and convenient as far as solutions to cosmological problems go, don’t you think? And that’s precisely what’s so bothersome about it. Nothing in cosmology is that simple, even inflation itself. Instead of slowing down, it’s accelerating. Instead of flying apart into clouds of stars and gas under their own momentum, galaxies are keeping their shapes until a collision distorts them thanks to invisible dark matter. Hell, some 96% of the universe isn’t even matter and almost three quarters of it is some mysterious energy feeding its expansion. Does it really make sense that in a universe like that simple, convenient explanations will fly?</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F15%2Fthe-infinitely-vast-mandatory-miltiverse%2F&title=the%20infinitely%20vast%2C%20mandatory%20miltiverse%3F\" id=\"wpa2a_2\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/15/the-infinitely-vast-mandatory-miltiverse/#comments" "f43be1617166895890f059835b0c5732") (19 (20928 18234 35694) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/12/how-to-approach-a-problem-with-mind-wide-shut/" "how to approach a problem with mind wide shut" "Greg Fish" "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 21:44:20 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/evo_marketing_440.jpg?resize=440%2C330\" alt=\"evolution marketing / darwin fish design\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7131\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Alarmed by the growing number of atheists among the current generation of young adults, one organization of Christians decided to sit some down for an interview to learn why they became atheists, drew conclusions, summed them up, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/listening-to-young-atheists-lessons-for-a-stronger-christianity/276584/\" target=\"_blank\">and respectfully posted them online</a>. Unlike many other faith groups, they legitimately wanted to understand what atheists thought and why, and what prompted their de-conversions. Problem is that they didn’t want to understand if all those atheists they interviewed had a point when discussing the improbability of an omniscient deity in their lives, ruling the universe from afar, yet being involved in the fate of every living thing. They were running a focus group to see what it would take to put those atheists back in the pews in a classic example of listening but not hearing. In their worldview, the inability of a pastor to prove that their faith is based on facts rather than tradition is the failure of a pastor since the infallibility of the religion is assumed as an unquestionable given.</p>
<p>The tone of the summary is almost clinical, like a psychiatrist surveying his patients and dutifully describing their pathologies to be analyzed by others. And while listing the reasons why atheists leave churches or never enter one, the piece recited a mantra declaring that Christianity is hard to understand, difficult to live up to, and teaches us to engage with the real world. As if a belief that an omniscient, omnipotent being incarnated as his own son to forgive humans for what he declared to be sins through self-sacrifice is as scientifically well proven as the structure of DNA. This is why this so-called \"interfatih dialogue\" is a bad idea for atheists. They’re not participants with a voice who get to express their views in a debate. They’re either patients to be studied for the future, or potential new believers yet to be swayed as far as the faithful are concerned. Yes, they might act like the nicest people in the world, but they’re not listening to you. They’re looking at you like a biologist looks at a dolphin and wondering how to teach you to do a trick…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F12%2Fhow-to-approach-a-problem-with-mind-wide-shut%2F&title=how%20to%20approach%20a%20problem%20with%20mind%20wide%20shut\" id=\"wpa2a_4\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/12/how-to-approach-a-problem-with-mind-wide-shut/#comments" "84aedf4562baf11f7d5d109d8b67d1a1") (18 (20928 18234 34765) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/11/social-media-the-best-way-to-share-with-friends-family-and-nsa-analysists/" "social media, the best way to share with friends, family, and nsa analysists" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 21:21:41 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/surveillance_camera_array_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"surveillance camera array\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16600\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>On the one hand, I am somewhat surprised by recent revelations about exactly how much we’re being watched on the internet by the NSA. However, the big surprise for me is that they couldn’t get data form Twitter. Considering that <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/03/22/how-would-the-nsa-surf-a-tsunami-of-data/\">it’s building an immense data center in Utah</a>, and works with tech companies on a regular basis, is it really that astonishing that the agency is browsing through our communications metadata on a regular basis? We all suspected this was the case, so if anything the current furor is almost a required reaction of anger and hurt to have what we always thought was happening and didn’t really want to, actually is happening. The question is what to do now, in the PRISM-aware world. Citizens know they’re being caught up in the dragnet when they’re just going about their day, foreign companies are afraid of the NSA spying on them via the advanced cloud technology the United States sells across the globe, and China could sit back and laugh off American reports of its hacking and spying on the web as hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Another fun fact is that Americans are actually split on how they feel about the NSA’s snooping and a majority of 56% <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/10/majority-views-nsa-phone-tracking-as-acceptable-anti-terror-tactic/\" target=\"_blank\">says that privacy is an acceptable casualty in trying to catch terrorists</a>. It might also be telling that the split hasn’t changed much since 2006 and that it breaks down by a distinct partisan preference, with liberals and conservatives flip-flopping on the issue when the other party was in the White House. So while the press is incensed and investigative reporters are falling all over themselves to talk about PRISM, the American people are shrugging it off by party affiliation. I would expect everyone to carry on as normal because if Facebook and Google didn’t have a mass exodus of accounts, it’s very unlikely they will. Plus, the NSA isn’t reading all the e-mail in your inbox. It just has a record of you e-mailing someone at a given time and if you are in the United States, your phone number and e-mail should be crossed out in their system, until of course a secret court order grants the analysis access to request the whole e-mail.</p>
<p>Even the slowdown in purchases of American high tech gear is likely to be temporary because much of what we’re hearing from many other countries is an almost mandatory response to the revelations about PRISM. In reality, many of the countries buying these tech products have very extensive spy networks of their own and engage in cyber-espionage on a daily basis. It’s kettle calling the pot black, and it’s likely that the rumors of tech companies giving the NSA back door access into their servers are just not true. There’s a number of ways to supply data to the NSA and a number of ways the NSA could’ve gotten the data itself. I’m not going to speculate how in this post because a) I don’t know the agency’s exact capabilities, b) there are people from both defense contractors and military agencies reading this blog who I’d just annoy with speculating, and c) most of them are probably much worse than having the companies just play ball when a court order comes down and an incredibly powerful agency is knocking on their door.</p>
<p>Now, none of this means this isn’t a big deal. But what it does signal is that the country which is dominating the world in the tech field and serves as the key node in the global communications grid <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/02/20/how-cyberwarfare-is-becoming-the-new-black/\">has been crying wolf about cyberwarfare and espionage</a> while actively waging it. We were starting to be sure of this when Stuxnet was discovered, we suspected it even stronger when all of its ingenious siblings like Flame and Duqu floated into the spotlight, we had a good idea that the United State was publicly holding back when reports of its potential in cyberwarfare drills with allied nations started surfacing, and with PRISM, we now know it for a fact. On the one hand, it’s bad news because your privacy is now not only being compromised by bad security or very lax internal policies of web giants, but by the government as well. On the other, we know that we’re hardly defenseless in the cyber realm and will fight and spy right back. Make of these facts what you will.

<p>According to Wired’s <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/05/actually-getting-to-mars/?pid=6958&viewall=true\" target=\"_blank\">laundry list of technical and political issues with getting humans to Mars by the year 2030 or so</a>, exploring another planet many millions of miles away won’t be Apollo 2.0 in many ways. It will be an order of magnitude more expensive per launch, require 30 months for a round trip, and needs to be financed, overseen, and executed by an international group that will include space agencies and ambitious aerospace companies with plans and launch vehicles of their own. And yet, the designs being drawn up sound remarkably like Apollo on steroids. We’re basically working with the same basic mission plans we had in the 1980s with a few workarounds for handling fuel and oxygen. Come on folks, this is another planet. It’s not just a status symbol and <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/03/02/why-a-flyby-of-mars-may-not-live-up-to-its-intention/\">we don’t need to rush there just to say we went</a>. Really, we don’t. Flag planting is great for propaganda and PR purposes, but it’s disastrous for long term exploration, which needs to be a very boring, consistent, and yes, expensive effort. We need a better plan than this.</p>
<p>Now, as much as this blog will support my assertion that I’m all about space exploration and will go as far as to advocate augmenting humans to travel into deep space (which led to numerous arguments with the Singularity Institute’s fellows), we don’t have to go to Mars as soon as we’re able to launch. It’s been there for 4.5 billion years. It’s not going anywhere for at least another five billion, and we owe it to ourselves to do it right. This is why instead of sending a much bigger capsule or an updated ISS for a 30 month round trip, we need to send inflatable, rotating space stations powered by small nuclear reactors. Instead of landers, we need to send self-assembling habitats. Instead of going to Mars to stick a flag into the ground, collect rocks, and do some very brief and limited experiments to look for traces of organic compounds, we need to commit to an outright colonization effort, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/04/30/why-we-need-to-return-to-the-moon/\">and we need to test the basics on the Moon before we go</a>. We won’t fulfill our dreams of roaming the stars and living on alien worlds if we don’t get this right.</p>
<p>Yes, it sounds downright crazy to propose something like that, especially thanks to the political climates of today. And it is. But at the risk of repeating myself, when we have trillions of banks to erase their bad bets from the books and nothing to aid the paltry budgets of space agencies or labs working on the technology of the future, the issue isn’t money. It’s priorities, vision, and will, and today’s politicians have the first one skewed, and more often than not either lack the other two, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/30/why-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science/\">or envision our society going backwards</a> as if this is a good thing. And we can keep right on placating ourselves by saying that we’ll at least get to roam around the solar system a bit like we did once, but that’s not how we should be exploring space. We know it’s not. if you want to really reach out into space, you go in for the long term with your eye on the spin-offs and benefits that will rain down from massive, ambitious, integrated projects that try to do what’s never been done before not by reinventing the wheel, but by attaching said wheel to a new airplane.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F10%2Fwhy-mars-is-not-the-next-apollo%2F&title=why%20mars%20is%20not%20the%20next%20apollo\" id=\"wpa2a_8\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/10/why-mars-is-not-the-next-apollo/#comments" "1b8e3a1c0c970a2e94fe8188749daabd") (16 (20928 18234 32538) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/08/the-impotent-cry-against-reason-and-logic/" "the impotent cry against reason and logic" "Greg Fish" "Sat, 08 Jun 2013 19:02:34 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/far_future_city_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"far future city\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16759\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Ever since the New Atheists arrived on the scene, there’s be a loud, wailing siren from religious and humanities pundits decrying the idea that we could use science to explain the universe that we occupy. Generally their argument for why we can’t use reason and experiments to clear up a lot of mysteries and what makes us tick <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2013/06/the_science_delusion_by_curtis_white_reviewed.single.html\" target=\"_blank\">boils down to \"how dare you say you can explain all this complexity and wonder in math and mechanistic descriptions?\"</a> And that’s really as far as it goes because their objection to using science to explain their pet topics in the language of formulas, statistics, and data sets is that it takes away a mystery they so desperately wanted to preserve for another sermon or tome of nebulous ponderings on the human condition. While researchers and engineers see the beauty in knowing how things work, science-phobic pontificators rush to the fainting couches, distraught that someone dare to explain their minds as sprawling networks neurons and accumulated experience alongside evolutionary mechanisms.</p>
<p>If you’re one of those people who needs to be a mysterious, delicate snowflake who is just way too complicated and nuanced to study, I’m sorry, but we can’t help you. Knowing how the world around us works in scientific, mechanistic language is how we build modern societies, land on a different world, send robots into deep space, and find cures for what ails us. If you refuse to see how knowing what makes the universe tick gives your existence even more meaning and a very enviable ability to modify the world to accomplish something, even to a small extent, that is your personal problem. Now, far be it from me to say that literature or religions never made profound contributions to humanity because they have. But what they couldn’t do was to find and confirm solid, experimentally proven, reliable answers to big questions about who we are and where we might be going. Science has given us a vast, complex, mysterious universe, and they’re upset that we can derive some algebra to try and explain how a few bits of it fit together?</p>
<p>Consider this. If you’re loudly and publicly rebelling against the scourge of \"arrogant scientism\" but you’ve ever tried something to find out what will happen and then repeated your experiment to confirm it, you’re a hypocrite. You relied on the scientific method to answer your question, not those nebulous \"other ways of knowing.\" Come to think of it, what are all of these \"other ways of knowing\" we hear invoked so often by both a fundamentalist zealot with a mind wide shut, and a crunchy New Ager with equal zeal? Voices of an omnipotent deity? The universe telling you that we’re all connected <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/05/09/how-new-agers-escape-the-human-condition/\">in a creationist fantasy for left wing anti-intellectuals</a>? That’s just your brain making shit up to put it bluntly. You can attend philosophical seminars and conventions of tweed suit-clad graybeards, huffing and puffing, and looking serious, saying \"isn’t life so mysterious?\" as Tim Minchin once put it, and rage against the fact that science can explain things that were once said to be off limits to mere mortals. It won’t change the fact that it’s our ability to explore, dissect, catalog, explain, and predict though science that makes us who we are.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F08%2Fthe-impotent-cry-against-reason-and-logic%2F&title=the%20impotent%20cry%20against%20reason%20and%20logic\" id=\"wpa2a_10\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/08/the-impotent-cry-against-reason-and-logic/#comments" "0ff4f434374e7b5a3f3ec35290527832") (15 (20928 18234 28172) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/04/does-meeting-online-mean-a-better-marriage-sort-of-but-dont-get-carried-away/" "does meeting online mean a better marriage? sort of, but =?utf-8?Q?don=E2=80=99t?= get carried =?utf-8?Q?away=E2=80=A6?=" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 04 Jun 2013 21:54:09 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/newlyweds_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"newlyweds\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16751\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>There’s been a bit of a splash by a new study which says that meeting your spouse online could mean a longer, happier marriage, and confirms that far from being the last refuge of lonely shut-ins, online dating is now one of the top ways to meet your mate. Now, the numbers do bear this conclusion out. Out of a representative sample of 19,131 people, the researchers found that a couple that met online is 28% less likely to divorce than their offline matched counterparts, and that the happiest marriages start with a meeting in MMORPGs and on social networks. However, and you knew this was coming, the differences are statistically significant but far from huge, and there are several caveats to taking the findings too close to heart, caveats which result directly from the study’s design. Basically, they’re collecting some demographic information if a subject was married between 2005 and 2012, asking how the subject met his or her spouse, and how happy the marriage seems, then looking for any statistically notable trends to emerge.</p>
<p>Here’s what the data mining found. A smidgen more than a third of the subjects (35%) married a person they met online. Half of those meetings happened on a dating site, usually eHarmony or Match.com, which each claim a quarter of these dating site meetups. So if you’re looking to get into a serious relationship or get married, those sites are probably a very good bet. Likewise, a few very interesting data points jump out from the results. The more well educated and gainfully employed you are, the more likely you are to meet a serious partner online. Those who earn at least $75,000 per year and have a college education represent some 57% of relationships that started online. Oddly enough, those with graduate degrees have the lowest share of marriages to partners they met online, under 15% of the total. The data doesn’t show why, but I would be interested in figuring this out. Why is this finding so worthy of attention? Because it may have a connection to <a href=\"http://economy.money.cnn.com/2012/05/02/the-rich-are-working-harder/\" target=\"_blank\">the so-called leisure inequality</a> and tell us more about why online dating grown so much in the last decade or so. But I digress. Now, what about that marriage satisfaction?</p>
<p>Well, again, the numbers do show that people who married their online friends report a better marriage, especially those who met playing online games or on social networks (which could or could not include dating sites, the paper isn’t specific on this). On a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being the equivalent of \"I’m ready to file for divorce this second\" and 7 being \"this marriage is perfect,\" these subjects reported an average satisfaction score of 5.72, which is pretty damn good. But if we consider the score of the most miserable married couples who met offline in a bar or through a blind date, they still post a very respectable 5.35 average. Yes, the online couples are happy and they’re happier than many other couples, but not by leaps and bounds. Could you really tell the difference between a 5.35 and a 5.72 happy when general contentment is 3.5? If we indulge in paraphrasing Futurama, these researchers are techncially correct, the best kind of correct in science. But practically, they just found close to 20,000 happy couples, a third of which just so happened to have met online and got married in a certain time range.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the biggest caveat with this study. Only 8% of these subjects are divorced which is both, a lot lower than the national average, and only shows the short term trend. If you look at marriages 10 years out rather than the seven for this survey, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr049.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the odds of a divorce are about 30% or so</a>. Get 20 years out and the odds increase to 48% on the high end. The sample here just hasn’t been married long enough and it’s probably a safe assumption that a lot were caught in their early phases of marriage. But the goal for getting married generally tends to be staying married for life, which means roughly half a century, going by the typical life expectancy figures. The researchers are, in a sense, catching people a mile or two into a marathon when a whole lot usually hasn’t happened yet and the biggest bumps in the road are still ahead, getting a general thumbs up from some 92% of the respondents, and splitting hairs about who gave the most enthusiastic thumbs up. True, this doesn’t mean that there’s a problem with a marriage to someone you met online and yes, maybe these couples are happier. But it’s too soon to tell.</p>
<p>Likewise, we should also point out <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/06/how-to-live-in-a-world-where-marriage-is-in-decline/276476/\" target=\"_blank\">that marriage rates keep on falling</a> and the domestic partner has been slowly becoming the new spouse. After witnessing messy divorces and confronted by general antipathy for marriage from many sides, a lot of people who would’ve already tied the knot are deciding to forgo the whole affair altogether. Now, this could mean that what the survey captured is a trend of people who get married staying together longer and being happier while more and more of their peers are opting out of married life, balancing out the high divorce rate over the next decade or so, but this is just an idea after looking at the data. Marriage as we are used to it in the modern world is changing. It’s becoming less commonplace, involves those who are more financially secure, and alternative households are becoming the new norm. So in light of all these changes, maybe the better question to ask is not what makes for a happier marriage but what makes for happy long term relationships, or at least what today’s long term relationship looks like from an academic standpoint. Work in that area is only beginning…</p>

<p>According to the stream of reports from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the Arctic ice is slowly but surely disappearing. Well, slowly for us humans. On geologic time scales, it’s thawing in the blink of an eye. For this year, the extent of the ice is <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2013/03/annual-maximum-extent-reached/\" target=\"_blank\">the sixth lowest on record</a>, and last year, there was about <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/charctic-interactive-sea-ice-graph/\" target=\"_blank\">half as much ice at minimum as there was between 1979 and 2000</a>, while also being much thinner. On the other side of the world, Antarctica is not doing much better as an average of <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/20100108_Is_Antarctica_Melting.html\" target=\"_blank\">100 cubic kilometers of ice are lost every year</a>, despite ice sliding into the ocean from dry land seemingly increasing the reach of sea ice. Now, this prompted many denialists to distribute a talking point that while the Arctic is melting, Antarctica is gaining ice, which would be true only if you measure sea ice and forget that there’s an entire continent thawing, sending all that excess ice out to sea. It’s sort of like claiming a virgin birth by forgetting to mention that the couple isn’t married and the child’s father lives across town, visiting every other day.</p>
<p>But all this said, there’s the big question is how bad all this thawing is for us. Sea levels may rise between 16 and 22 feet, changing coastlines and altering climactic cycles over a century. How worried should we be? And is there any way to stop it? Well, exactly how worried you should be would depend on where you live and whether you think another century is too short of a time to move the cities back from the sea. The world is not going to flood as shown in many apocalyptic posters from environmental groups. To drown a city like that would require massive and sudden natural disasters like asteroid impacts or a magnitude 9.1 quake that triggers a monster tsunami and sends it towards a city built mostly below sea level. No city planner 30 or 70 years from now would be dealing with the same exact coastlines, and old buildings could be moved or altered to deal with the rising water. Of course, if we didn’t emit nearly as much carbon dioxide by building our economies around energy efficiency, we could just avoid all of that in the first place.</p>
<p>Though, just to play Devil’s advocate, there’s an interesting point that needs to be raised. New economies and infrastructures are expensive. Very expensive. And the thawing Arctic means a shorter path between Europe, Asia, and North America than the Panama Canal. Goods can get to their destinations cheaper, new fiber can be laid for a faster, more redundant internet, and a lot of oil and natural gas will be open to exploration far away from the Middle East. And while as the United States and Canada extract more and more oil from the Arctic, OPEC could just lower production to keep prices high, the political ramifications are huge and to many, worth perusing. Is potential energy independence that will let the United States disentangle itself from the Middle East and its messy affairs, while creating new jobs and cozy ties with its neighbors worth moving some big cities back from the rising seas? And do the improved economics of fast, new shipping lanes and extra fiber-optic cables just sweeten the deal to let it all melt?</p>
<p>Before we get carried away though, there is a downside to such strategic terraforming. Warmer climates mean more droughts in areas that are now among the world’s bread baskets, and a lot less food. In some countries, which produce far more food than they can consume or send over as aid, this isn’t a pressing issue. But in countries not producing enough, or just barely enough to get by, famines could easily reemerge because the farmlands couldn’t be moved to land that belongs to another state. For nations on good terms, there might be a deal in the making. For countries that view each other as an existential threat (like India and Pakistan), not so much. Oh and bad news for foodies. When food sources become any scarcer in a warmer world, the only viable response is doubling down on hyper-efficient factory farms that employ methods that can drive a panel of Food Network chefs up a wall. Point is that your experience with the effects of a warmer Earth may vary depending on many factors, but deciding how to manage the warming is not as cut and dry as a yes or a no, there’s an economic and geopolitical calculus involved…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F06%2F02%2Fyes-the-ice-caps-are-melting-but-is-that-bad%2F&title=yes%2C%20the%20ice%20caps%20are%20melting%2C%20but%20is%20that%20bad%3F\" id=\"wpa2a_14\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/06/02/yes-the-ice-caps-are-melting-but-is-that-bad/#comments" "cc283be417a47aadda38e995681e8e27") (13 (20928 18234 25446) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/31/how-to-create-a-self-fulfilling-anti-tech-prophecy-with-withering-cynicism/" "how to create a self-fulfilling anti-tech prophecy with withering cynicism" "Greg Fish" "Fri, 31 May 2013 14:00:05 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dubai_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"dubai_600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16740\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Last time we took a look at <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/03/and-now-for-a-little-technophobic-paternalism/\">what tech cynics and technophobes get wrong in their arguments</a>, we focused on their lack of consideration for their fellow humans’ ability to exercise free will. Despite the fact that this is a huge hole in many of their arguments, there’s an even bigger problem with the dismissive stance they take towards science and technology. When they argue that we can’t feed all the hungry  house all the homeless, or really prolong lifespans with technology, the facts they cite generally point not so much to technological limitations or scientific ignorance, but very convoluted social and political problems, then insist that because science and technology can’t solve them today, they likely never will, or won’t solve them adequately to consider the problem much smaller than it is today. While this argument is true, it’s also logically dishonest. You can’t fix the world’s problems with technology when the people who should be using it refuse to do so, or hijack it for their own less than noble means. No tool or piece of knowledge can help then.</p>
<p>As some of you might have noticed, the city in the graphic for this post in Dubai, a rich proving ground for how the cities of the near future are likely to be built. We know how to make cities of glass, steel, and concrete right out of science fiction. We know how to build the cheap, efficient housing complexes those making less than a dollar a day need to at least have secure shelter. We know how do diagnose complex diseases early enough to treat them before they’ll become dangerous, much less terminal, and our toolkits for understanding germs, viruses, and complex medical problems like cancers, are growing to become more sophisticated every day. We also have the tools and the money to apply all these solutions to the world at large. With something a little bit short of $100 billion just between Gates and Buffet pledged to fight poverty  illiteracy, and disease, and when we can find $2 trillion laying around to help banks with a do-over, clearly, it’s not an issue of not having the technology, the scientific basis, or the cash. The issue is will.</p>
<p>Sure technological utopians have lofty ambitions and <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/08/08/when-technocrats-think-theyre-better-than-you/\">it’s valid to be skeptical of many of them</a>, but when they vow that logistical problems can be solved with enough computing and research, they’re right more often than not. When the cynics deride these ambitions by pointing out that a lot of people don’t want to fund mass production of the necessary tools or the required science, and would much prefer to spend them on entertainment and public entitlements benefiting them directly, they’re not highlighting the problems with using technology to save the world, they’re a prime exhibit of why a technology hasn’t transformed the world of fixed a persistent problem. All too often it comes down to them saying it can’t be done, and politicians along with voters simply listening to them and deciding that no, it’s can’t be done since the critics said so, which is why it would be a waste of time to even bother. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure, a social variation of Newton’s First Law: a society that insists on the status quo, sticks to the status quo unless an external event or constant pressure forces it to change. </p>
<p>It’s the same attitude <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/08/11/whats-holding-back-modern-science-and-technology/\">which strangled the promising and much anticipated future of space travel and exploration</a>, and we’re still stuck with it. Yes, not every retro-futuristic dream about space or living on other worlds was practical or even feasible  and yes, we did need experts to burst our bubble before an unworkable project got off the ground. But today’s science and tech critics are going well past a healthy skepticism about bold claims and venturing into a territory in which they dismiss scientific and technological solutions to global problems for the sake of dismissing them, pointing to other ideas they dismissed in the past and doomed to being chained to the drawing board, and saying that because their relentless cynicism killed the ideas rather than refined the scopes and missions to eliminate problems with them, new ideas building on past visions must be scrapped as well. It’s even more insidious than <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/30/why-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science/\">political vetting of basic science</a>, because vetting at least allows some projects to survive and get refined into new tools and ideas. The withering cynicism of what science and technology can do for us is like an anti-innovation WMD…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F31%2Fhow-to-create-a-self-fulfilling-anti-tech-prophecy-with-withering-cynicism%2F&title=how%20to%20create%20a%20self-fulfilling%20anti-tech%20prophecy%20with%20withering%20cynicism\" id=\"wpa2a_16\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/31/how-to-create-a-self-fulfilling-anti-tech-prophecy-with-withering-cynicism/#comments" "62fa4f0c7bb949633ccade4186468e4c") (12 (20928 18234 22425) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/29/why-scientists-really-dont-need-the-input-of-philosophers-like-raymond-tallis/" "why scientists really =?utf-8?Q?don=E2=80=99t?= need the input of philosophers like raymond tallis" "Greg Fish" "Wed, 29 May 2013 14:33:11 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/grumpy_cat_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"grumpy_cat_600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16736\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>A long time ago, I shared one of my favorite jokes about philosophers. It went like this. Once, a president of a large and prestigious university was asked who were his most expensive staff to fund. \"Phycisists and computer scientists,\" he replied without hesitation, \"they always want some brand new machine that costs a fortune to build and operate, not like mathematicians who only need paper, pencils, and erasers. Or better yet, my philosophers. Those guys don’t even need the erasers!\" Yes, yes, I know, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/07/15/trying-to-find-the-limits-of-philosophy/\">I’m a philosophical phillistine</a>, I’ve been told of this so many times that I should start some sort of contest. But my lack of reverence for the discipline is not helped by philosophers who decide to speak up for their occupation in an age of big data and powerful, new tools for scientific experimentation to propose answers to new and ever more complex real world questions. Case in point, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/27/physics-philosophy-quantum-relativity-einstein\" target=\"_blank\">a column by Raymond Tallis</a> declaring that physics is broken so much so that it needs metaphysics to pull itself back together and produce real results.</p>
<p>Physics is a discipline near and dear to my heart because certain subsets of it can be applied to cutting edge hardware, and as someone whose primary focus is distributed computing, the area of computer science which gives us all our massive web applications, cloud storage, and parallel processing, there’s a lot of value in keeping up with the relevant underlying science. And maybe there’s already an inherent bias here when my mind starts to wonder how metaphysics will help someone build a quantum cloud or <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/01/14/to-boost-data-density-chill-and-apply-magnetism/\">radically increase hard drive density</a>, but the bigger problem is that Tallis doesn’t seem to have any command of the scientific issues he declares to be in dire need of graybeards in tweed suits pondering the grand mechanics of existence with little more than the p’s and q’s of propositional logic. For example, take his description of why physics has chased itself into a corner with quantum mechanics…</p>
<blockquote><p>A better-kept secret is that at the heart of quantum mechanics is a disturbing paradox – the so-called measurement problem, arising ultimately out of the Uncertainty Principle – which apparently demonstrates that the very measurements that have established and confirmed quantum theory should be impossible. Oxford philosopher of physics David Wallace has argued that this threatens to make quantum mechanics incoherent which can be remedied only by vastly multiplying worlds.</p></blockquote>
<p>As science bloggers love to say, this isn’t even wrong. Tallis and Wallace have mixed up three very different concepts into a grab bag of confusion. Quantum mechanics can do <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/04/27/oh-quantum-causality-we-hardly-knew-ye/\">very, very odd things that seem to defy the normal flow of time</a>, but there’s nothing that says we can’t know the general topology of a quantum system. The oft cited and abused Uncertainty Principle is based on the fact that certain fundamental building blocks of the universe can function as both a wave and a particle, and each state has its own set of measurements. If you try to treat the blocks as particles, you can measure the properties of the particle state. If you try to treat them as waves, you can only measure the properties of the waves. The problem is that you can’t get both at the same exact time because you have to choose which state you measure. However, what you can do is create <a href=\"http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/quantum/style_a/packets.html\" target=\"_blank\">a wave packet</a>, where you should get a good, rough approximation of how the block behaves in both states. In other words, measurement of quantum systems is very possible.</p>
<p>All right, so this covers the Uncertainty Principle mixup, what about the other two concepts? The biggest problem in physics today is the lack of unification between the noisy quantum mechanics on the subatomic scale and the ordered patterns of general relativity. String theory and the very popular but nearly impossible to test many worlds theory tries to explain the effects of the basic forces that shape the universe on all scales in terms of different dimensions or leaks from other universes. So when Tallis says that it’s still 40 years and we don’t know which one is right, then piles on his misunderstanding of quantum mechanics on top of Wallace’s seeming inability to tell the difference between multiverses and string theory, he ends up with the mess above. We get a paradox where there isn’t one and scope creep from particle physics into cosmology. Not quite a ringing endorsement of philosophy in physics so far. And then Tallis makes it worse…</p>
<blockquote><p>The attempt to fit consciousness into the material world, usually by identifying it with activity in the brain, has failed dismally, if only because there is no way of accounting for the fact that certain nerve impulses are supposed to be conscious (of themselves or of the world) while the overwhelming majority (physically essentially the same) are not. In short, physics does not allow for the strange fact that matter reveals itself to material objects (such as physicists).</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, a grab bag of not even wrong is supposed to sell us on the idea that a philosopher could help where our tools are pushed to their limits. Considering that Tallis <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/12/14/the-curious-case-of-a-skeptical-bait-and-switch/\">dismisses the entire idea that neuroscience as a discipline has any merit</a>, no wonder that he proclaims that we don’t have any clue of what consciousness is from a biological perspective. The fact is that we do have lots of clues. Certain patterns of brain activity are strongly associated with a person being aware of his or her environment, being able to meaningfully interact, and store and recall information as needed. It’s hardly the full picture of course, but it’s a lot more than Tallis thinks it is. His bizarre claim that scientists consider some nerve pulses to be conscious while the majority are said not to be is downright asinine. Just about every paper on the study of the conscious mind in a peer reviewed, high quality journal refer to consciousness as a product of the entire brain. </p>
<p>The rest of his argument is just a meaningless, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism\" target=\"_blank\">vitalist</a> word salad. If brain activity is irrelevant to consciousness, why do healthy living people have certain paterns while those who had massive brain injuries have different ones depending on the site of injury? Why do all those basic brain wave patterns repeat again and again in test after test? Just for the fun of seeing themselves on an EEG machine’s output? And what does it mean that it’s a surprising fact that we can perceive matter around us? Once again, hardly a serious testament to the usefulness of philosophers in science because so far all we got is meaningless questions accusing scientists of being unable to solve problems that aren’t problems by using a couple of buzzwords incorrectly, haphazardly cobbling bits of pieces of different theories into an overreaching statement that initially sounds well researched, but means pretty much nothing. Well, this is at least when we don’t have Tallis outright dismissing the science without explaining what’s wrong with it…</p>
<blockquote><p>Recent attempts to explain how the universe came out of nothing, which rely on questionable notions such as spontaneous fluctuations in a quantum vacuum, the notion of gravity as negative energy, and the inexplicable free gift of the laws of nature waiting in the wings for the moment of creation, reveal conceptual confusion beneath mathematical sophistication.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we get a double whammy of Tallis getting the science wrong and deciding that he doesn’t like the existing ideas because they don’t pass his smell test. He’s combining competing ideas to declare them inconsistent within a unified framework, seeingly unaware that the hypotheses he’s ridiculing aren’t complimentary by design. Yes, we don’t know how the universe was created, all we have <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/01/20/an-appeasement-of-cosmic-proportions/\">is evidence of the Big Bang</a> and we want to know exactly what banged and how. This is why we have competing theories about quantum fluxes, virtual particles, branes, <a href=\"http://\">and all sorts of other mathematical ideas created in a giant brainstorm</a>, waiting to be tested for any hint of a real application to observable phenomena. Pop sci magazines might declare that math proved that a stray quantum particle caused the Big Bang or that we were all vomited out by some giant black hole, or <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/07/18/mining-physics-for-grounbreaking-papers/\">are living in the event horizon of one</a>, but in reality, that math is just one idea. So yes, Tallis is right about the confusion under the algebra, but he’s wrong about why it exists.</p>
<p>And here’s the bottom line. If the philosopher trying to make the case for this profession’s need for inclusion into the realms of physics and neuroscience doesn’t understand what the problems are, what the fields do, and how the fields work, why would we even want to hear how he could help? If you read his entire column, he never does explain how, but really, after all his whoppers and not even wrongs, do you care? Philosophers are useful when you want to define a process or wrap your head around where to start your research on a complex topic, like how to create an artificial intelligence. But past that, hard numbers and experiments are required to figure out the truth, otherwise, all we have are debates about semantics which at some point may well turn into questions of what it means to exist in the first place. Not to say that this last part is not a debate worth having, but it doesn’t add much to a field where we can actually measure and calculate a real answer to a real question and apply what we learn to dive even further.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F29%2Fwhy-scientists-really-dont-need-the-input-of-philosophers-like-raymond-tallis%2F&title=why%20scientists%20really%20don%E2%80%99t%20need%20the%20input%20of%20philosophers%20like%20raymond%20tallis\" id=\"wpa2a_18\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/29/why-scientists-really-dont-need-the-input-of-philosophers-like-raymond-tallis/#comments" "ce08308d5405ffa3733c01dc2cd719b8") (11 (20928 18234 20382) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/28/why-the-new-star-trek-was-doomed-to-trekkie-hatred/" "why the new star trek was doomed to trekkie hatred" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 28 May 2013 22:28:57 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/enterprise_vs_dreadnaught_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"enterprise vs. dreadnought\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16728\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>A good swath of the geek part of the internet is lit up with fury about Star Trek Into Darkness. It’s manifested on the familiar nerd hubs like <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/05/star-trek-into-darkness-carol-marcus/\" target=\"_blank\">Wired</a>, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/star-trek-into-darkness-impressive-but-imperfect/\" target=\"_blank\">Ars</a>, and <a href=\"http://io9.com/star-trek-into-darkness-the-spoiler-faq-508927844\" target=\"_blank\">io9</a>, especially io9, which is downright incandescent with rage about the movie’s choice of villain. Numerous calls have been made for the heads of J.J. Abrams and his crew on platters, to soothe the angry Gods of Trek, while fans of the franchise are busy offering ideas for what would’ve made the movie better, which, surprise surprise, involve following the canon of the original series and the spin-offs. But this was a given when you consider the source material and the fan base. You can’t reboot a franchise simply by continuing the story arcs already decades in the making, you can’t make an exciting movie that focuses on tedious exopolitical negotiations in the neutral zone, and you will ruffle some feathers when you try to boldly go (or go at all) where the franchise has never gone before.</p>
<p>For example, one of the big complaints about Abrams’ vision of Star Trek is the militarization of the Federation’s fleet. But here’s the thing. It’s a fleet of spaceships that might face adversarial life forms (like the Romulans and Klingons), the ships are armed with lasers and missiles, and a botched first encounter can turn a peaceful delegation of explorers into a military incursion. So it’s kind of hard to blame Abrams for seeing the potential of the Federation to wage war, and in dire circumstances, use ships that were once meant to explore the galaxy for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_projection\" target=\"_blank\">force projection</a>, as the Enterprise is used in Into Darkness. And of course there’s the commercial consideration. A sci-fi movie sells best when there’s war involved because that makes a good popcorn flick that’s going to attract big crowds. People generally struggle with peaceful meditations on life from all those little green men, and often don’t try to apply it back to the world they inhabit.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, Star Trek was supposed to rise above these commercial considerations but today, sci-fi is a hard sell. For studios, it’s either popcorn munching military science fiction or another rom-com because they’re a business and movies are expensive to make, especially those which require lots and lots of special effects. If you’re a die-hard Trekkie, you’re going to have to make some concessions to people who live outside your bubble and really couldn’t care about all the intricate stories to which you dedicated countless hours. Who knows, they might like the idea so much, they go back and rediscover what you saw in the source material. But if you’re going for mass audiences, something has to give and compromises have to be made. And here is where we run into the biggest complaint of them all, that Abrams was recycling deep material from the original rather than creating something completely new out of it. Unfortunately, this is an area in which every reboot director is facing a lose-lose proposition by the nature of the project.</p>
<p>Had Into Darkness essentially been an updated Wrath of Khan, Abrams would’ve been pilloried for simply giving the classic a coat of fresh paint, just like io9 was savaging him for using classic material and inverting it, with the writer sounding nearly apoplectic with fan rage. If the movie’s plot resembled nothing ever seen or done on Star Trek, the Trekkies would’ve been infuriated that they got their Star Trek without anything that made it like Star Trek, asking why Abrams did not make and references to the original and just borrowed the names, ships, and logos to make something completely different under the same brand name. That’s the nature of a reboot. You won’t be able to please the fans either way unless you simply continue where the last episode of their franchise left off without missing a beat, and that sort of defeats the whole idea of a reboot in the first place. Into Darkness was a fun movie, it had its moments, and it was technically very, very well executed for what it was supposed to be. And at least it has people interested in sci-fi, which is more than we could say for many past and upcoming sci-fi flicks…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F28%2Fwhy-the-new-star-trek-was-doomed-to-trekkie-hatred%2F&title=why%20the%20new%20star%20trek%20was%20doomed%20to%20trekkie%20hatred\" id=\"wpa2a_20\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/28/why-the-new-star-trek-was-doomed-to-trekkie-hatred/#comments" "6df5ccf4e0f6083e1f4bcb5f127b4ddf") (10 (20928 18234 19124) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/18/from-virtual-reality-pioneer-to-anti-singularitarian/" "from virtual reality pioneer to anti-singularitarian" "Greg Fish" "Sat, 18 May 2013 14:21:19 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/future_dystopia_600.jpg?resize=600%2C330\" alt=\"future dystopia\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16723\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>This is not the first time Jaron Lanier gets a post on Weird Things, in fact we met him before as he quickly <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/08/11/when-philosophy-meets-artificial-intelligence/\">went off the rails in describing AI</a>, then became more incoherent <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/08/31/jaron-lanier-vs-history-and-the-singularitarians/\">while bemoaning all social media as a dehumanizing waste</a>, all the while trying to pick a fight with the Singularitarian version of a machine-directed utopia. Now, the former virtual reality pioneer has <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/book-review-who-owns-the-future-7000015123/\" target=\"_blank\">moved on to a book length rumination on how technology is killing the middle class</a> by eliminating jobs. And as per his current modus operandi, he starts off with a tiny kernel of a reasonable statement, and proceeds to strap it to the Hyperbole Rocket and launch it into deep space. Is it true that a new software package or a robot might make your job obsolete? Yes, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/02/24/how-do-you-future-proof-your-job-prospects/\">it absolutely can</a>. But does the technology prevent you from getting a new job? No, it doesn’t because the reasons why you’re going to have trouble finding work in a globalized economy <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/11/01/robots-just-might-take-your-job-and-keep-it/\">are more political than technological</a>, and it’s short term greed, partisan bickering, and ignorance of the powers that be at fault.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Lanier’s opening salvo says that when Kodak was at the height of its market domination of personal photography, it employed more than 140,000 people. Now, he says, the face of personal photography is Instagram which has only 13 employees. Therefore, jobs were lost because of technology, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.\" target=\"_blank\">Q.E.D.</a> Um, no. First and foremost, Kodak died the slow and painful death it did because it first refused to adapt to a world of digital photography, then couldn’t, as it wasted years assuming that as long as they can at least sell the tools to develop all those digital photos on glossy paper, they’ll be fine. They never even thought that paper may be useless for most of the pictures being taken today as social media and smartphones took off. Secondly, as much as tech blogs may have hyped it, Instagram was not \"the new face of photography.\" Take away cheap, mainstream digital photography and it couldn’t exist. It was a distribution network, a network that Kodak could’ve built. But instead of innovating, it slowly withered away.</p>
<p>All right, so what happened to those tens of thousands of people laid off by Kodak? Well, they could find new jobs because among those laid off were managers, assistants, chemists, and IT specialists who could’ve applied their skills in other companies, doing other things, and I assure you that there aren’t 140,000 middle class workers out there who haven’t worked a day since a Kodak executive pink slipped them to meet the quarterly numbers. Eeyore would’ve been more optimistic about their future than Lanier, but then again, for optimism, Lanier would’ve needed to see technology as something more than a nefarious tool to use and abuse the populace. Where the disciples of Ray Kurzweil <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2011/02/15/techno-utopianism-makes-it-to-time-magazine/\">see immorality, sunshine  rainbows, and unicorns</a> frolicking in the meadows, he seems to see impending chaos, destruction, and socioeconomic dystopia adapted from the pages of very gloomy science fiction. And yet, Lanier plans to live with this grim future. For a fee of course. You see, in his version of if-you-can’t-beat-them-join-them, he’s suggesting that if social media sites use our data to survive, they should pay us for it, and that’s how we will start solving the impending job crisis caused by these evil machines taking our place.</p>
<p>Certainly, while being paid to mess around on Facebook would be a great deal, the problem is that paying all of its users even pennies a day would leave the company insolvent. Social media sites simply don’t make all that much money because <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/10/06/so-how-is-that-social-web-working-out-for-facebook/\">they fell short of the promises they give a lot of advertisers</a> when it comes to moving product for them. All the data you submit simply won’t give them nearly as good of a picture of who you are and what you like as Lanier and so many tech pundits think it does when they fall for the company’s wild claims. In fact, predicting what a person will do based on his or her social media footprint <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/09/02/trying-to-predict-the-future-one-stat-at-a-time/\">is an exercise in warm reading</a>. There’s plenty of detail to go on, but a lot of this detail may be useless and lead to broad conclusions or incorrect recommendations. Advertisers are not moving nearly as much product as they thought they would, people are giving them incomplete and misleading information, social media makes money but not as much as it thought it could, and now Lanier wants this struggling ecosystem to pay its users for making it profitably mediocre? Does he also have a bridge to sell us?</p>
<p>Yes, the world is changing. Yes, technology is doing things it’s never done before, and it’s now taking us places where we’ve never been, physically, socially, and economically. But instead of trying to figure out a way to productively deal with with the change of pace, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/09/05/waiting-for-the-corporate-messiahs-to-save-us/\">by investing in R&D and shifting more jobs into innovation and design</a>, while letting robots do more of the execution, people like Lanier want to take their ball and go home. The problem is that they can’t. Arguing if our sprawling data centers and powerful software needs to be scaled back and dumbed down is like protesting against the wind blowing. You can waste your oxygen telling it to slow down or go in a direction you’d personally find more acceptable, or you can raise some wind generators for an extra kilowatt hour or two to take advantage of the situation. At no point has any civilization ever grown or met a challenge by saying \"no, we’re done,\" or demanding payment to participate in new ideas, new economies, and new social structures. Many have died and stagnated doing exactly that, which is why we shouldn’t take Lanier’s technophobic musings seriously.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F18%2Ffrom-virtual-reality-pioneer-to-anti-singularitarian%2F&title=from%20virtual%20reality%20pioneer%20to%20anti-singularitarian\" id=\"wpa2a_22\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/18/from-virtual-reality-pioneer-to-anti-singularitarian/#comments" "32d5c7368f8e569d08d221ed04c82b91") (9 (20928 18234 17679) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/16/psychologists-convenience-samples-and-really-shoddy-popular-science-writing/" "psychologists, convenience samples, and really shoddy popular science writing" "Greg Fish" "Thu, 16 May 2013 20:50:20 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/exposed_brain_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"exposed brain\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16717\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>

A survey trying to make the link between someone’s first sexual experience and what sexual activity follows based on 319 heterosexual college students who started having sex only about two years prior to the study and were asked to describe their intimate activities with some very positive and some very negative adjectives from a proscribed list. While the critics ask why the population was so homogeneous and the responses were so limited, this actually makes a lot of sense. If you’re not sure of your hypothesis, you want to have the most uniform samples you can find and limit inherently qualitative feedback into more quantitative form. From there on, you can test if the theory holds for more sexually experienced and diverse populations. So why are science writers harping on a perfectly legitimate, well done hypothesis fishing study?</p>
<p>Probably because it’s recent and it found that the students’ first sexual experience tended to be indicative of how they’d describe their future ones. And when limited to the population studied, it does make sense. Many of them are still relatively wet behind the ears and having finally had a real sexual encounter, they’re wondering what others will be like and comparing it to their first as they get more and more experience because it’s usually one of their few points of reference. At the same time, however, as the first experience fades into memory, new highlights come to take its place and a terrible first time gets forgotten in favor of the last mind-blowing experience and that might go on to color future encounters. We could also wonder about couples who lost their virginity to each other and haven’t had sex with anyone else. So why didn’t the researchers take cases like this into account? Well, they’d be outside the scope of the study, which basically just points out the obvious that yes, there’s a mental link between what you thought of your first time and your future preferences and expectations, as it applies to the sample population.</p>
<p>And that last phrase is really the crux of the matter because while human sexuality is so diverse and complex that questions about it could easily fuel centuries of studies and experiments, the pool of people willing to be studied is limited and the external factors they’d bring into the study makes it complicated to tease out complex and minute differences that might hint at something more, something that merits further research. College undergraduates are easy to recruit, easy to find close to the researchers’ labs, and fairly easy to homogenize, so they make for a simple, convenient set of test subjects in pilot studies. They’re a classic go-to convenience sample, and if you want to study special populations, you’ll go and study those special populations when you have the resources to do so. It’s just not fair to expect a narrow study to account for everything and use it a s springboard to pontificate on the limited utility of convenience sampling in basic psychology published for the public. And here the media has to take some heat as well.</p>
<p>How many pop sci writers just copy and paste the press release? How many of them wrote click bait headlines that sound as if an exhaustive study settled the question of just how special your first time is to you and what role it plays in your sex life? And how many of them trying their best to be contrarians put words in the researchers’ mouths and criticized them for making claims not actually made by the study? My guess? Quite a few. In fact, the links to a critical review of three other studies in the referenced critique were papers uncritically hyped by the media to become the viral stories they became. We can certainly argue about how much psychologists are relying on convenience samples of white, college educated students in the West, and what this does to the field as a whole. However, if the initial studies seem to be suffering from a bad sample or are way too limited to be applied outside of a very narrow socioeconomic group, the media klaxon is making the problem a hundred times worse. For writers to then wag their finger at the scientists, saying \"tsk, tsk on your sampling techniques\" without acknowledging that their colleagues have been running away with inconclusive and narrow studies for years is very disingenuous.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F16%2Fpsychologists-convenience-samples-and-really-shoddy-popular-science-writing%2F&title=psychologists%2C%20convenience%20samples%2C%20and%20really%20shoddy%20popular%20science%20writing\" id=\"wpa2a_24\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/16/psychologists-convenience-samples-and-really-shoddy-popular-science-writing/#comments" "9ec7e7d90c639bdf90337fff7834211f") (8 (20928 18234 14688) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/13/conspiracy-writers-rediscover-the-cias-sex-slaves/" "conspiracy writers rediscover the =?utf-8?Q?cia=E2=80=99s?= sex slaves" "Greg Fish" "Mon, 13 May 2013 21:42:25 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/barefoot_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"barefoot\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16142\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Conspiracy theories about mind control are nothing new. In fact, I’ve lost count how many books from Jim Marrs and David Icke purport some sort of mind control beam, or wave, or program by the nefarious Illuminati altering our consciousness so we become mere puppets to the will of an evil intelligence. And considering how many of them are out there, they’re getting harder to sell, even to an audience primed to hear more stories about sinister mind control experiments which sound pulled right form the pages of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illuminatus!_Trilogy\" target=\"_blank\">Illuminatus! Trilogy</a>, so if you’re a conspiracy theorist with a book to sell, you have to spice it up somehow, and sex slavery seems to be emerging as the new trend in getting people’s attention. A good example is <a href=\"http://www.theconspiracyreview.com/1/post/2013/04/mind-controlled-sex-slaves-and-the-cia.html\" target=\"_blank\">a new book from the Conspiracy Journal</a> which builds itself on the story of Cathy O’Brien, a woman who claimed that she was a victim of the CIA’s more sinister MKULTRA subproject codenamed Monarch in a Satanic Panic era potboiler called Trance Formation of America. Yes dear readers, sex can sell anything…</p>
<p>Now, where do we begin? When you open <a href=\"http://ia600502.us.archive.org/10/items/TranceformationOfAmerica/tranceformation_america.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">an online version</a> of O’Brien’s book, you’ll be quickly hammered by countless attempts to prove that a) mind control exists, b) no one talks about it to hide how effective it is from you, thus engaging in a form of mind control, and c) because there are reams of paperwork showing that the CIA experimented with mind control, it means we have to believe O’Brien and her stories of CIA sex slaves created for the pleasure of malevolent big wigs whose cooperation America wanted to secure during the Cold War. Oy. Here’s the problem in this line of reasoning. The kernel of truth here is that the CIA did attempt to experiment with all sorts of mind control ideas to teach its spies, but just about all of them were spectacular failures so one of the big reasons why so many were kept hush hush is because they flatly didn’t work and the agency didn’t want anyone to know how badly they were struggling with anything other than drugging a person and very unevenly interrogating him or her in an intoxicated state.</p>
<p>But instead of showing how mind control can work, O’Brien simply claims that absence of a well understood or recognized form of mind control means that it must exist, then goes on to equate tightly controlled state propaganda with mind control. That doesn’t really work. Mind control has the connotation that there’s a device, or a chemical cocktail that will make you do the bidding of whoever has it. Propaganda is basically brainwashing through tight control of information. That’s not the same thing, and it relies on a totalitarian regime that could control everything its citizens see and hear, a regime like North Korea. And even there the total control breaks down when an errant signal gets picked up on the radio or an outlawed internet connection is established that lets the regime’s prisoner-citizens see into the outside world. Having lived in a real authoritarian state, I can tell you that America today is far too permissive to exercise that kind of “mind control by disinformation,” unless you can prove that the entire Western world is being brainwashed, a claim that requires a very significant burden of proof and for some political miracles to occur.</p>
<p>And this is where the <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/01/08/the-bizarre-mindset-of-conspiracy-theorists/\">mind controlled CIA/Illuminati/Builderberg sex slaves</a> come in. They are the reward for those rich, famous, and powerful enough to advance the New World Order’s agenda, though one wonders since when the rich and powerful, for whom money is no object, became so easily bribed with sex. They can easily charm or buy their way into women’s panties as shown by countless scandals of exactly that happening. Even more bizarre to me is that stories of female sexual slaves are plentiful while virtually nothing exists on male sex slaves. This doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Surely a global network of thousands of power players must feature straight women with an appetite for lithe young men, or homosexual fatcats. So why do we hear nothing at all about them? Of course there’s more. O’Brien’s vivid recollections of abuse at the hands of all sorts of foreign diplomats, power brokers, and Satanic cultists — oh we’ll be back to that, don’t you worry for a second that we won’t — came to her through hypnosis, like the memories of alien abductees though a process we’ve seen before, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/06/22/a-comprehensive-look-at-alien-abductions/\">a process which has no scientific basis</a>.</p>
<p>So in the end, what we have is a mix of Satanic Panic ritual sexual abuse, misuse of hypnosis on highly suggestible subjects, and conspiracy theories borrowing from <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2008/10/09/new-world-order-old-world-news/\">the Taxil Hoax</a>. And that’s a perfect mix in the 1990s, when the tabloids are on fire with the idea of Satanic subliminal music, and wild claims of countless children being tortured and future Miss Teen Americas raped in the catacombs of cultists acting on behalf of the Devil, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/09/13/weekend-satanists-for-jesus/\">and greedy con men are writing confessions of their supposed guilt in the nasty undertaking</a>. Isn’t it odd that O’Brien’s tale fits just oh so very perfectly with the predominant money making conspiracy literature of the time, literature quickly shown to be either untrustworthy or outright made up and sold as real accounts? And shouldn’t we wonder why perfectly these calibrated salacious rumors and supposed real tales of power, sex, magic, and aliens should be trusted when they’re repackaged to sell to us a second time, a few decades after they were last popular? Human trafficking like the type shown in Taken is bad enough without money-making boogeymen like the Repotoids, CIA, and the Illuminati. Maybe we should keep them out of a very real and very dire problem? Just a thought…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F13%2Fconspiracy-writers-rediscover-the-cias-sex-slaves%2F&title=conspiracy%20writers%20rediscover%20the%20cia%E2%80%99s%20sex%20slaves\" id=\"wpa2a_26\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/13/conspiracy-writers-rediscover-the-cias-sex-slaves/#comments" "1cb56bd306199eb1723d73fad4f78d78") (7 (20928 18234 13147) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/07/when-you-measure-for-the-sake-of-measuring/" "when you measure for the sake of measuring" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 07 May 2013 21:52:38 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/counting_the_days_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"counting the days\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16707\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>One of Warren Buffet’s most famous pieces of advice to analytic managers is to measure the things that matter, not just the things that are measurable. It’s a lesson lost on Chris Dancy, the IT professional whose claim to fame <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/02/quantified-work/all/\" target=\"_blank\">is measuring every second of his workday</a>. Every second. I meant it. Every call, meeting, bathroom break, document edit, e-mail reply, and work tweet has a special color coded entry in Google Calendar so his bosses will know exactly what he was doing at 1:13 PM last Tuesday and appreciate his ability to document every moment at the office. Just one thing is left out on his mind-bendingly detailed calendars — how much time he wastes on his pointless endeavor. Seriously, if your boss read that post and thinks this is a good idea, I would highly suggest firing up your resume and passing it along to some good friends because you’re working for someone who doesn’t want to manage employees, you’re working for someone who wants to manage robots and look at dashboards to make pretty reports for executives.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Factory work can be easily measured in terms of how much time is spent on a part, how much time is idle, how many widgets are out the door each day, and other very hard metrics that can track how a factory lives and breathes. Service oriented positions like IT have a lot of soft elements to them. Whereas parts have to be manufactured to exact specifications, an important code block can be written in many ways. Sending a 1,000 sprockets to quality control by the end of the day means meeting several orders on schedule. Sending 44 tweets about the newest app throughout the day might mean a few sales, or might mean nothing at all. You get a lot of numbers that don’t actually mean anything by using Dancy’s methodology. Yeah, he goes to a lot of meetings and does a lot of IT paperwork. So what? How many times did he have to do it again because it didn’t provide enough detail to developers? How would the developers rate it and would they rather have someone else do it next time? How thorough was his testing?</p>
<p>If you want decent metrics from your IT department, you have to look at quality of what it sends out to be used. How many people like the products? How many would recommend them to their friends? How much are they willing to pay for them? How many units were sold? What was the overall return on investment and how did the expenses break down overall (labor vs. tools)? Or what’s the turnaround time for fixing a defect? How many defects did internal QA workers catch versus how many were reported by users after shipping? Those are important metrics and they should matter a lot more to IT management than how many times someone like Darcy had to go to the bathroom or how many pages of documents he or she wrote that day. So the idea that if some aspect of your day can be measured it should be, and your bosses will appreciate you just going right ahead and measuring it for them, is absurd to put it gently. Ultimately what matters is what you produce so even if you’re extremely busy and making the most of out your day, if you produce nothing really useful, none of your intricate daily calendars will save you from the HR’s chopping block, and don’t you dare blame that on not measuring your day enough.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F07%2Fwhen-you-measure-for-the-sake-of-measuring%2F&title=when%20you%20measure%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20measuring\" id=\"wpa2a_28\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/07/when-you-measure-for-the-sake-of-measuring/#comments" "505048a9642546121351980634ea6e70") (6 (20928 18234 10463) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/04/yes-sometimes-its-good-to-write-for-free/" "yes, sometimes =?utf-8?Q?it=E2=80=99s?= good to write for free" "Greg Fish" "Sat, 04 May 2013 14:43:00 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/old_typewriter_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"old typewriter\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16702\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>In March, freelance journalist Nate Thayer is incandescent with rage. It wasn’t that he’s trying to make his living by writing and no one’s paying attention. In fact The Atlantic is knocking on his door and asking to run condensed versions of one of his blog posts. No, the big problem <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/nate-thayer-vs-the-atlantic-writing-for-free.html\" target=\"_blank\">is that they were not offering to pay him for it</a>, and their once upon a time talks of a $125,000 per year retainer never really came to anything because the editor working on it was killed in Iraq. Thayer was livid, saying that he can’t feed his kids, can’t pay for his internet connection, and can barely pay his rent, so how dare the publication offer him nothing but exposure. Maybe it was wise that he didn’t take the deal because it would’ve made <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/nate-thayer-atlantic-charged-with-plagiarism.html\" target=\"_blank\">the charges of partial plagiarism for the post</a> in question all the more embarrassing. But charges and controversies aside, when I came across a reference to Thayer’s debacle, I thought it would be a good idea to highlight what this incident shows about new vs. old media and why journalists will find themselves fewer in number.</p>
<p>Here’s the important thing about selling your services. Just because you need to make a certain amount of money to pay rent, doesn’t mean that what you’re trying to sell is worth that much to the entity interested in buying. Professional journalists who worked back when there weren’t any blogs around to break news, and newspapers were arbiters of what was must-read, are used to being able to take their time, work on a story, and get paid good money for their efforts. But this wonderful world of overseas posts, expense accounts, and large retainers is now gone. People like the immediacy of breaking news through social media and TV, and then in depth summaries and investigations as the situation settles down. And they get this from virtually everywhere free because anyone can break stories. The result? News is cheap. So how will The Atlantic cover a six figure retainer for someone producing stories that aren’t necessarily that valuable and won’t generate enough traffic to pay for themselves at such sky high rates?</p>
<p>On top of that, exposure is a good thing. I’ve had one of my posts reproduced by io9, of course with my permission. It gave the blog more credibility and more traffic, which helped a syndication deal I had at the time because the payouts were based on the number of readers. Being picked up by Time Warner’s news sites was also a huge boon, and although few of the publications for which I’ve written sent me cold, hard cash, the traffic and exposure for my work made this blog turn a profit. At no time was I laboring under the delusion that I was going to make six figures for my pop sci writing because pop sci articles are a dime a dozen. The web is positively lousy with them. The money from the blog was simply a way to help with rent while doing some freelance IT work and if it became something more, great. For Thayer to expect anything more out of a blog nowadays is simply unrealistic, and his fury at being offered free exposure sounds really out of touch. If his kids are going hungry and his rent is going unpaid, he needs to find another way to make money because let me tell you from experience, this writing stuff doesn’t pay well.</p>
<p>That said, there will always be some room for investigative journalists and researchers who will curate what’s circling around social media, track down sources, and find out real stories, but it’s unlikely that they won’t rely on the traffic their stories generate for their salaries and donations from readers who want them to keep going and appreciate the time it takes to create a massive, long form expose. But again, their stories better be gripping, fascinating, and start debates on a national scale. An abbreviated review of North Korea policy doesn’t necessarily fit that bill while parsing leaked information about top secret drone strikes does. The future of journalism is very savvy writers who act as their own editors and work in partnership with publications, not as their employees, focused not just on their stories but the economics of their storytelling. If former big shot journalists like Thayer don’t know that, they really need to wake up and smell the coffee as they read through the Twitter feed, looking for material for their next post…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F05%2F04%2Fyes-sometimes-its-good-to-write-for-free%2F&title=yes%2C%20sometimes%20it%E2%80%99s%20good%20to%20write%20for%20free\" id=\"wpa2a_30\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/05/04/yes-sometimes-its-good-to-write-for-free/#comments" "090e5afefdf3fb56f2f5b9182650ab75") (5 (20928 18234 9254) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/30/why-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science/" "why we need to keep politicians away from science" "Greg Fish" "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 21:21:43 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/microcosm_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"microcosm\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15760\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Really, the politicians in office today, science, and technology simply don’t mix. We have years and years of bills and their behavior proving this. From <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/08/31/the-peter-principle-stacks-the-deck-against-science/\">vapid remarks about science</a>, to serious debate about <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/06/19/cyber-security-youre-doing-it-very-wrong/\">an internet kill switch</a>, to <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/05/15/how-we-shouldnt-fix-research-grant-problems/\">inviting woefully unqualified people to judge what should be funded by the NSF</a>, it’s as if our lawmakers are trying to live <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/02/14/calling-all-boss-haters/\">the stereotype of over-confident managers who think they’re experts at all things because they can talk a big game</a>. It would be amusing were they not in a position to actually change how science is being funded, and churn out ridiculous proposal after ridiculous proposal. The latest volley of this oblivious ineptitude is the bill from Lamar Smith (yes, R-TX, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/05/18/the-state-of-texas-vs-science-and-education/\">a real shocker</a>, I know) which lays out <a href=\"http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2013/04/us-lawmaker-proposes-new-criteri-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">what sort of projects the NSF should be funding</a> and in the process basically discards anything that’s not an applied military or a medical project, negating the entire point of basic research and eviscerating basic research funding not obfuscated to look like a future treatment, weapon, or infosec system.</p>
<p>Basic science is done because we’re curious about something and we don’t know what sorts of applications or spin-offs it might have. Maybe there will be none. Maybe we’ll discover something as incredibly useful as lasers. Maybe there will be no direct benefit but in the process, we’ll build something that will change the world, like the world wide web being derived from a project meant to help particle physicists share data from particle collider results at CERN. We just don’t know, which is why we try to study all these things, and the results provide more than enough ROI as direct applications and spin-offs are commercialized. However, a lot of people will not see it that way, insisting that if something can’t be on the market within a few years, or used to kill bad guys half a world away, it’s a waste of money. And not only do they see it that way, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/03/10/why-so-many-said-that-apollo-wasnt-worth-it/\">they refuse to even try to understand how basic research and the scientific process work</a>. They also <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/02/23/why-scientists-wont-be-elected-in-the-u-s/\">do not care for, or understand scientists</a>, deluding themselves with myths about their lifestyles.</p>
<p>And this is how we get the Lamar Smiths of the world. His constituents truly believe that a typical scientist could never make it in \"a real job,\" and lives off of government welfare in the form of an enormous grant, handed over like a blank check from the NSF. The facts that scientists actually make something like $55,000 per year on average, have to deal with the NSF approving only a small fraction of all the grant applications they receive (below 10% in many fields and up to 20% in some others), and generally to already well established scientists, and that they can be fired for not being top of their field, do not register with them. It’s so sadly ironic that people who can easily out-earn scientists in their lifetimes and can keep their jobs if they’re at least mediocre, are deriding woefully underpaid professionals who can be fired for not being in the top 10% of their discipline and have to pay their own salaries through fundraising and political savvy. And it’s an insult to injury when said people turn scientifically illiterate politicians into their attack dogs.</p>
<p>But this is what happens when people are allowed, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2011/04/03/yes-education-is-good-for-you-stop-whining/\">and even encouraged</a>, to remain glib and as incurious as they please by politicians and public figures who rush to pat them on the back and give them a gold star for just being who they are. The current push to structure basic education around standardized testing rather than discovery, curiosity, and career orientation isn’t helping either. If we just let kids find out what fascinates them and feed their curiosity with key subjects that will let them pursue it further, they’ll learn the reading, the math, and the history involved to perform well on whatever standardized tests you’ll give them. After all, any field requires a solid command of basic literacy and mathematical competence to fully understand. But that requires the effort to restructure how the education system works, basically, giving a shit and trying to do something about it, to put it bluntly. However, by the choices a lot of people are making in their elected officials, and their support of said officials’ scientific illiteracy and hostility to science, I’m willing to bet that not a whole lot of the required shits are being given on average…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F04%2F30%2Fwhy-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science%2F&title=why%20we%20need%20to%20keep%20politicians%20away%20from%20science\" id=\"wpa2a_32\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/30/why-we-need-to-keep-politicians-away-from-science/#comments" "580c9b1dc1fd069a6762de16578b9029") (4 (20928 18234 6330) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/26/why-colonizing-another-planet-really-shouldnt-be-a-reality-show/" "why colonizing another planet really =?utf-8?Q?shouldn=E2=80=99t?= be a reality show" "Greg Fish" "Fri, 26 Apr 2013 13:36:30 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mars_one_habitat_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"mars one habitat\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16691\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>The Mars One project generated a good deal of media attention by promising to fund its efforts to colonize the Red Planet with a reality show which would follow the crews on their one way trip and chronicle their efforts at living on another world. Now while this sounds like the most far out premise for the next season of Survivor, it’s a terrible idea for an actual mission. If you’ve ever seen a reality show, you know that producers don’t really cast people as much as they cast the stereotypes they think will give viewers the most bang for their buck. If Gordon Ramsey didn’t go on epic tirades over every dish not up to his par, slamming trays, punching the food, and having fits of apoplectic rage that would put a banshee to shame, you’d be left with a fairly boring hour of TV that would be more at home at the Food Network than on a broadcast channel. Could you imagine Hell’s Spacecraft as a real mission to extend human cities to a new planet?</p>
<p>And that’s not even getting to the fact that Mars One is asking anyone to apply for what should be a mission for extremely well trained professionals with numerous actual space flights on their resumes, and <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/applications-open-for-mars-one-the-first-human-space-colony/\" target=\"_blank\">charging as much as $38</a> just to look at an application, and that it will rely on new rockets built by SpaceX to do the actual work, as well as the fact that it’s spending no time at all trying to address <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/03/02/why-a-flyby-of-mars-may-not-live-up-to-its-intention/\">all the problems with flying to Mars in capsules</a>? At the end of the day this has to be either a scam, or just a really terrible idea that will never pan out. Make no mistake, I’m not saying that we shouldn’t try to colonize Mars or that we can’t pull it off if we really devoted plenty of time, energy, and resources to it. We absolutely should and we’re probably very close to the place we need to be to safely and comfortably send crews to the Red Planet. But making reality shows out of it, raising money by promising one way trips to alien worlds, and relying on brand new technology not really meant or tested for these missions is not the way to go about it.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F04%2F26%2Fwhy-colonizing-another-planet-really-shouldnt-be-a-reality-show%2F&title=why%20colonizing%20another%20planet%20really%20shouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20a%20reality%20show\" id=\"wpa2a_34\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/26/why-colonizing-another-planet-really-shouldnt-be-a-reality-show/#comments" "0373fc5e33c0ff57667e7c2f6f141e3d") (3 (20928 18234 5410) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/25/how-to-shield-yourself-in-a-vacuum-sci-fi-style/" "how to shield yourself in a vacuum, sci-fi style" "Greg Fish" "Thu, 25 Apr 2013 20:28:17 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/alien_bacteria_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"alien bacteria\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16225\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>In a fair bit of science fiction, we see advanced alien species use some sort of shielding to walk around other planets or survive being ejected into space. Something around them flickers and a protective invisible bubble is raised, protecting them from a horrible death by dehydration as all the fluid in their bodies effectively boils away. As it turns out, that’s actually possible. So far it’s only been done with fruit fly and mosquito larvae, but we apparently know how to create a shield from extreme conditions, capturing water and necessary gases trapped in a field of electrons or plasma. All you have to do is take a specimen into an electron scanning microscope and send a shower of electrons or a plasma beam at your target. The electrons and ions envelop the living specimen, creating a little, almost skin-tight biodome that contains just enough air for it to move and otherwise keep very obviously living for about an hour. So, you might ask, electromagnetic spacesuits for everybody? Well, no, not exactly. There are a few really important caveats.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the specimens are being irradiated, and the more powerful the shielding has to be, the more radiation it requires to organize itself. Humans could get radiation poisoning as their suits are being beamed onto them, or at least risk extremly dangerous exposure levels. But if you think a little cancer is worth it, there’s the issue of being trapped with your air supply. With no scrubbers, your respiration would produce dangerous level of carbon dioxide and you would die of hypoxia after about 45 minutes to an hour or so, depending, of course, on your breathing and how much of an air supply you initially had. And now might be a good time to mention that a spacesuit created by nothing but charged particles wasn’t the original goal of the research, the idea was to insulate insects so their movements could be studied in the vacuum of the electron microscope’s sample chamber, so there’s not going to be a team working on these issues in the near or far future. But at least we now know that there really is something to the electromagnetic shielding we see in sci-fi all the time, even though it would make for a lousy spacesuit…</p>

<p>Now, I’ve written a great deal about <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/tag/ancient-astronauts/\">the ancient astronaut hypothesis</a>, the idea that alien beings had profound influence on our evolution and civilization. Usually, when I did, I talked about a lack of a smoking gun for extraterrestrial meddling in our genome or our politics, and pointed out just how rare it would be for an advanced alien species with a passion for exploration to evolve close to the same time period as us, detect our planet, cross light years to get here, and have interest in doing anything on Earth to cover the scientific basics. But what about another line of evidence from ancient astronaut believers? According to them pictures of weird beings and stories of all sorts of bizarre creatures, monsters, and mysterious chariots in the sky must point to visitations, an assertion countered by skeptics with alternative explanations that usually have to do with the religious art commonly produced by the civilizations in question or pointing out the believers’ all too tenuous grasp of the historical facts and games of confirmation bias.</p>
<p>However, there’s another idea that seems to be missing. Our ancestors wrote fiction and were every bit as creative as we are. In fact, we have records of jokes that date to nearly 4,000 years ago and epic sagas that are more than a thousand years old. Fun fact, the oldest known joke in human history is a fart joke. The second? A joke about women wearing nothing but fishnets for the visual benefit of a pharaoh. The oldest European joke? A bait and switch riddle that seemed to be describing a penis. Yes, humanity hasn’t changed all that much when it comes to humor, I know. And that’s precisely the point. We shouldn’t take everything we see from the past literally like ancient astronaut believers, although we sometimes do. The legend of King Arthur written in Perceval has inspired many true believers today to argue that there’s a real Holy Grail, just see the book on which the DaVinci Code was based: Holy Blood, Hold Grail. Despite being written as an epic fictional tale with colorful characters and fictional creatures, people take parts of it to be factual or based on fact simply because they mention other mostly or semi-fictional works.</p>
<p>So when an ancient astronaut theorist invokes ancient texts, why not ask how he or she knows if the text was meant to be taken seriously? Were the flying creatures on flaming chariots part of a religious tract meant to guide worshipers of ancient gods or was it entertaining fiction for those who ruled our first empires? How many of the soap operas meant to describe the life of the gods in ancient mythology was canon and how much were creative add-ons? When we read ancient texts on religious matters, are we confusing their versions of Bibles with their versions of the Left Behind books? We know our ancestors were creative enough to dream up gods and monsters, and mastermind engineering projects that would take decades to complete. We know there were great epics with highly fictionalized tales of past wars and natural disasters, and we know there were countless books lost as ancient libraries were burnt down by illiterate conquerors or rabid zealots. So why do ancient astronaut theorists insist on treating every artifact from the past as a record of a historical fact rather than even pretend to allow for works for art and fiction?</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F04%2F22%2Fseparating-ancient-history-from-ancient-fiction%2F&title=separating%20ancient%20history%20from%20ancient%20fiction\" id=\"wpa2a_38\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/22/separating-ancient-history-from-ancient-fiction/#comments" "9e904cc0cd7930281c33d2759d4b2780") (1 (20928 18234 1597) "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/19/why-evolution-didnt-really-need-darwin/" "why evolution =?utf-8?Q?didn=E2=80=99t?= really need darwin" "Greg Fish" "Fri, 19 Apr 2013 21:04:50 +0000" "<p><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/darwin_600.jpg?resize=600%2C375\" alt=\"darwin\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16678\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>
<p>Generally, we tend to associate powerful theories with the people who first proposed them and say that without Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Einstein, Heisenberg, Turing, or all the other scientists featured in countless books as visionaries, our world wouldn’t be the same, and the knowledge we take for granted now would’ve never made it to us. Well, this is somewhat true. Change who discovered, say, germ theory and how it was proposed, and you’d have different criticisms and politics, and adoption curve by the scientific establishment of the day so the world would indeed be a different place. But when it comes to the knowledge, it would largely be similar. That’s one of the greatest things about science. Call physics \"objectology\" and change the variables in the formulas, and the body of work will still describe pretty much the same processes with the same mechanics because that’s just the way nature works. The differences would be in what bleeding edge ideas would dominate the debate among the experts and professionals, not the basics.</p>
<p>And so, <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2013/03/darwin-deleted.html\" target=\"_blank\">a new book by historian Peter J. Bowler</a>, argues that without Darwin, biology as we know it today would be virtually the same. Were the young naturalist thrown overboard during a storm as he traveled the world, compiling evidence for his theory, there were many scientists waiting to fill the role of evolution’s historical focal father. Wallace probably fits the bill best since it was his version of the theory that prompted Darwin to dust off his by then 20 year old manuscript. And if Wallace’s ideas failed to get any attention, the idea of natural selection was still in the air, it just needed a solid footing to really take off and fuse with genetics. If anything, argues Bowler, neo-Darwinian synthesis might have actually been expedited with Wallace because his theories had more developmental underpinnings, and would turn the field’s focus to complex genetics we’re trying to master to the forefront sooner. And of course there would’ve still been vocal creationist opposition to the idea in all forms. It’s basically a given, much like gravity and entropy.</p>
<p>Even the charges of evolution inspiring eugenics and the horrors of the Holocaust would’ve still persisted because the people who were ultimately responsible for them were looking for any kind of excuse to reshape humanity to their liking. Considering that <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/10/06/the-creationist-quest-to-slime-darwin/\">their understanding of selection was pitiful</a> and <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2008/10/21/the-ghosts-of-pseudo-science-past%e2%80%a6/\">their knowledge of hereditary mechanisms was non-existent</a>, they weren’t exactly interested in the science. They just wanted a patina of facts to hide their bigotry and racism, and anything that sounded like it could be bastardized into serving their goal was used. Hundreds of years before them, religion was used to justify mistreatment of minority groups throughout much of the Western world, be it selective accusatory clauses from the Old Testament, <a href=\"http://worldofweirdthings.com/2010/09/18/ratzinger-finds-a-new-scapegoat-for-his-troubles/\">or invoking the loathsome Deicide Doctrine to defend systematic segregation and prosecution of Jews</a>. In fact, much of the legendary Witch’s Hammer reads like the furious ranting of a misogynist who would easily show up any self-appointed Men’s Rights Activist on the web, the 15 century male version of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Dworkin\" target=\"_blank\">Andrea Dworkin</a>. Would Kramer have abused evolution to fuel his misogyny? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this doesn’t mean that Darwin’s accomplishments were trivial or that Galileo was simply stealing from Eratosthenes, or that the re-invention of the steam engine was no big deal. There was a good deal of research, work, and insight involved in doing what they did and being the first to have your work recognized and adopted so widely is still a feat. It doesn’t matter that others could’ve done it too because how nature works will always be there for someone to come along and discover. What matters is that they seized the moment and advanced our civilization, giving us new fields to explore. But Bowler’s exercise also proves an important point. Science is ultimately about the facts. The data comes first, the theory to explain why the data is this way is second, and the people who put it all together come third. And while visionaries deserve all their accolades, they are not completely indispensable  At worst, their absence from history would’ve delayed a discovery. Nature didn’t uniquely open up to them to grant them insight  Anyone can discover something new and fascinating, and sometimes something that can change the way we think about the entire universe. And that’s what makes science such a terrific endeavor.</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldofweirdthings.com%2F2013%2F04%2F19%2Fwhy-evolution-didnt-really-need-darwin%2F&title=why%20evolution%20didn%E2%80%99t%20really%20need%20darwin\" id=\"wpa2a_40\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/worldofweirdthings.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png?resize=256%2C24\" alt=\"Share\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></a></p>" nil "http://worldofweirdthings.com/2013/04/19/why-evolution-didnt-really-need-darwin/#comments" "63f562677fa2cc989c1a97571bb40ecd")))
