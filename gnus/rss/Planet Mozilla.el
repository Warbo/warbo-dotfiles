<p>As an long-time feminist activist, I have felt tremendous relief from the amount of peer support I’ve gained from working with The Ada Initiative.

I deeply appreciate the professional commitment of everyone at TAI and everyone I met at AdaCamp! That’s part of why I’m posting to ask you to donate.

Reason is that similar to other groups we want to offer everyone more insight into our projects, and that we might find even more community members who are interested to <a href=\"http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/?automation=1\">help us</a> and learn new stuff at the same time. If you have comments or proposals to the style and contents please let us know.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>Beginning of last week we promoted <a href=\"https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/andrei.eftimie/\">Andrei Eftimie</a>, who is working for our team as a <a href=\"http://www.softvision.ro/\">Softvision</a> contractor from Romania, as peer for our <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/qa/mozmill-tests\">Mozmill Tests repository</a>. That happens in regard of all his contribution in the last couple of months. So if you are looking for a reviewer of your patch, you can flag him from now on. <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.automation/6Uv2Txnjiw8\">Congratulations</a> again.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/davehunt/\">Dave Hunt</a> got the performance tests running on the “Leo” devices now. Those are testing the <a href=\"https://datazilla.mozilla.org/b2g/?branch=v1-train&device=d300&range=7&test=cold_load_time\">cold load times</a> and <a href=\"https://datazilla.mozilla.org/b2g/?branch=v1-train&device=d300&range=7&test=fps\">fps</a> of the applications under test.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of weeks we detected a lot of application disconnects while running the Mozmill tests for Firefox under the Mozmill-CI system. As it has been turned out notifications (bubbles) from application updates could be the problem, and especially the new update overlay screen for Windows 8 updates. The latter completely blocked our testing. So <a href=\"https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/whimboo/\">Henrik Skupin</a> re-configured all existing nodes and templates by disabling any automatic update checks (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=900860\">Bug 900860</a>). Since that has been done, no further application disconnects have been observed. Lets cross the fingers that this will stay that way!</p>
<p>We noticed a massive disconnect of slave nodes in our Mozmill-CI cluster early last week. At the same time the response time of our Jenkins master was drastically slow. Henrik investigated the problem and identified that our current VM is not able to handle the memory load with 2GB of memory. So we increased the memory to 4GB, which indeed stopped the swapping process of consuming about 60% cpu load nearly all the time. Henrik will <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/mozmill-ci/issues/258\">continue to watch</a> the current memory consumption over the next weeks. Further we will <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/mozmill-ci/issues/257\">upgrade our Jenkins installation</a> to the latest LTS version soon, once all blockers are fixed.</p>

I deeply appreciate the professional commitment of everyone at TAI and everyone I met at AdaCamp! That’s part of why I’m posting to ask you to donate. It’s important to make support for women in free and open source tech and culture truly part of our infrastructure. We can do that by funding that work!

"Chris Heilmann" "Tue, 20 Aug 2013 04:43:08 +0000" "<p>In the last few weeks I was slightly off the grid. I had a quick holiday, I traveled, I enjoyed the “fun” of wireless offers in US hotels. Sometimes that is a good thing. I realised a few things in that time, and discovered a few amazing posts online that very much agreed with what I thought.</p>
<p>Here’s what I realised: <strong>we are obsessed with numbers and it is killing our creativity</strong>. Our online life right now is running the danger of being a constant chase of bigger numbers and more reach and there is actually not much substance to it.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisdervisevic/4745520501/\" title=\"The Facebook Like Stamp by Denis Dervisevic, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"The Facebook Like Stamp\" height=\"333\" src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4121/4745520501_da25937a79.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>
<p>Instead of concentrating on writing and sharing and creating we start hunting the quicker impact, the larger group to talk to and the more immediate feedback. This leads to a quick collection of seemingly impressive numbers that actually don’t mean much but in essence are a quick fix to make us feel important. Instead of thinking our work through, we throw it out. We throw it far and wide and we hope that a pure law of large numbers means that we reach a lot of people that either need to know what we talk about or get inspired by it. Or relay it to even more people which increases our impact even more. Alas, it doesn’t. As everybody else is running the same race.</p>
<p><img alt=\"skinner box\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Skinner_box_scheme_01.png\" /></p>
<p>The social web we are amazed about and – in some cases – addicted to is the perfect <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber\">Operant conditioning chamber</a>. Just like a slot machine we are constantly chasing the next reward, we always think our next update will be the next big thing. Getting a positive result for each of our actions is boring. Getting one big reward every once in a while means we keep going on and on throwing things out there until we get the next reward. We chase a pattern of success that doesn’t exist, but as it happens once in a while we keep thinking there was some logic to it.</p>
<p>A lot of what ends up on social networks is not something we wanted to put there but because we believe it but something that will get the most results and responses. Likes, retweets, Google Pluses, Comments, hits on our blogs. All things that are easy to measure and obvious to see as a success although we have no clue whatsoever if what we put out there was even read before people shared it. A lot of people do that. We re-distribute what other people – people who others look up to – say because that shows we are “in the know” and know where to go to find good content. One of the biggest needs for things to “go viral” is not the quality of the content – it is the ease of distribution. This is why people post quotes of famous people – in many cases even misquoted – as images to get around limitations like 140 characters.</p>
<p>We trade creation and creativity for quick, meaningless, but easily quantifiable success. We inflate our blog post with grandiose titles like “the best solution to $x”, “why $x should do $y” or the incredibly inflated “35 things everyone needs to know about $z”.</p>
<p>The amazing publishing platform web is running the danger of becoming a bazaar where amateur marketers compete in making things look cooler, simpler, wittier than they are to get a quick applause in the form of likes. We don’t go online to find out things in depth – we want a quick solution to allow us to do more in less time to add more to the already impossible to understand pile of stimulants and shards of information. The thirst for knowledge or entertainment is not the main reason why we get our phones out, instead it is the nagging blinking sign of unread new updates, each an enticing hint that the next cool thing might be one of them and we need to keep getting them not to miss the all important one – which most likely we will miss as we are preoccupied with the chase of more and newer.</p>
<p>We even do this at the cost of our privacy as <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxObserver-Cory-Doctorow\">Cory Doctorow mentioned in his TedX Observer talk</a>, but more importantly is the point that we are acting like junkies, filling our need for quick validation and immediate satisfaction instead of taking the time to really consume what we get or to cherish the relationships we form.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/70534716\">The Innovation of Loneliness</a> is a superb, very short talk about this, and validated my worries and thoughts:</p>
<p> </p><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/70534716\">The Innovation of Loneliness</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/shimicohen\">Shimi Cohen</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p><p></p>
<p>The main message here is that as humans we can only consume and stomach a certain amount of social interactions and relationships. As social media is a massive game of numbers we ironically start to get more lonely by connecting more as we cheapen relationships and reduce them to numbers and instead of deepening the relationships we increase the number of “friends” we have. The goal is to collect more, not to care about who they are. It is a hoarding mentality, accumulating lots of relationships in case we need to follow up with them later when we need them. Not realising that in order to be able to rely on a relationship, we also need to foster and nurture it. And a “like” does not cut it.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://rog.ie/blog/derailed\">Rogie King’s Derailed</a> is another superb post on this subject. He speaks in detail about the “social addiction” we can fall into and the bitter disappointment we can feel when all our efforts were just there to increase numbers.</p>
<p>Let’s stop being rats in a box pressing a button. Let’s break the game by not playing it but realising that an increase in numbers is not a real win and that a few unread updates really are not the end of the world.</p>" nil nil "50bb45d2946d0578f7c1e762a230028c") (635 (21011 9124 399735) "http://robert.ocallahan.org/2013/08/creating-screencasts-on-linux.html" "Robert O'Callahan: Creating Screencasts On Linux" "Robert" "Tue, 20 Aug 2013 03:06:14 +0000" "<p>I had great difficulty creating a good screencast for the previous blog post.

That was an incentive for me to knuckle down over the last couple of days and fix some issues in our implementation of <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-svgopentype/2013Jul/0003.html\">the Mozilla-Adobe proposal</a> that adds an \"SVG\" OpenType table to render glyphs in SVG format. </p><p>I had to update our implementation from our original prototype to use the format defined by the merged Adobe-Mozilla proposal. Then I had to track down a bug in the calculation of glyph extents for SVG glyphs --- this turned out to be a generic bug affecting any font with egregious glyph extents, so I'm glad we've caught it. The last and most interesting part of the Gecko work was to enable animation in SVG glyphs. This is tricky because we need to map from a font whose glyphs have changed back to all documents and text that using that font, so we can ensure the text is properly repainted, and we've never needed this mapping before. gfxFont.cpp is gnarly but the code worked out OK. </p><p>Creating fonts with SVG glyphs has required hacky scripts so far, and I was getting tired of that, so before I did the Gecko changes I wrote a small Web app to help: <a href=\"https://github.com/rocallahan/svg-opentype-workshop\">SVG OpenType Workshop</a>. You can open an existing OTF/TTF font file (sorry, no WOFF support yet), create/edit an SVG table document, see the results on (editable) sample text live as you type (generating a new font file at every keystroke), and save the generated font. I found it very useful, and it shows that you can have live font editing in Web apps without an SVG font DOM or other dedicated browser APIs. To render the fonts, the application requires browser support for the SVG-OT draft mentioned above, so for now only <a href=\"http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/try-builds/rocallahan@mozilla.com-3354d4190694\">experimental Firefox builds</a> will work. </p><p>Check out this <a href=\"http://people.mozilla.com/~roc/animated-SVG-glyphs.webm\">screencast</a> of animated glyphs in action.</p>" nil nil "a0965e6dd2d5e5376d4af4c9cca53ae6") (633 (21011 9124 397330) "http://tantek.com/2013/231/b1/questions-twitter-related-headlines-feature" "Tantek =?utf-8?Q?=C3=87elik=3A?= Questions About @Twitter's Related Headlines Feature " nil "Tue, 20 Aug 2013 01:57:00 +0000" "<div class=\"e-content entry-content\">

<p>Some questions immediately came to mind:</p>
<h4><a href=\"http://tantek.com/2013/231/b1/questions-twitter-related-headlines-feature#like-mentions\">Is this like showing pingbacks and mentions?</a></h4>
<p>Many blogs for quite some time (notably,
<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/WordPress\">WordPress</a> blogs)
have shown
<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/pingback\">pingbacks</a> of links from other blogs, with a title of the referencing blog post and (an often awkwardly) abbreviated post summary.
</p>
<p>Similarly, some existing blogs have \"Referencing Articles\" or \"Mentions\" among other
<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/posts#Footer_sections\">things in the footer section of posts</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, newer <a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com\">indieweb</a> blogs are showing mentions received via
<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention\">the webmention protocol</a> - which is essentially everything you wanted in pingback, and less (no XML-RPC baggage, just HTTP).
</p>
<p>Thus are \"Related headlines\" of a tweet the equivalent of pingbacks or mentions sections in blog posts?</p>
<h4><a href=\"http://tantek.com/2013/231/b1/questions-twitter-related-headlines-feature#whitelist\">Do related headlines require domain whitelisting?</a></h4>
<p>Twitter's
<a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards\">Twitter Cards</a>
feature requires that your website be \"approved\" (<abbr title=\"Also Known As\">AKA</abbr> whitelisted) before information from your site shows up in summaries underneath tweets.
</p>
<p>Do all articles (blog posts) that embed a tweet (like this post that embeds the @Twitter tweet above) show up in the \"Related headlines\" section of a tweet?</p>
<p>Or do only posts from Twitter-whitelisted domains show up in \"Related headlines\"?</p>
<p>And if so is there a separate \"Related headlines whitelist\"?</p>
<p>Or does Twitter simply have a single master whitelist they use for Twitter Cards and Related headlines?</p>
<p>Whatever the answers, such \"whitelisting\" has long been a source of confusion and doubt with odd things happening like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/17789\">being \"approved\" but not seeing Twitter Cards</a> summaries
</li>
<li><a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/16103\">or an inexplicable \"sensitive content\" notice</a> instead of a summary.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these begs additional questions (on the linked pages).</p>
<h4><a href=\"http://tantek.com/2013/231/b1/questions-twitter-related-headlines-feature#notification\">How does Twitter discover articles that embed tweets?</a></h4>
<p>When an article embeds the HTML markup of a tweet, there's no explicit mechanism to notify Twitter that that the article has done so.</p>
<p>So how is Twitter notified of the embedding?</p>
<p>Does it require someone to view the article that embeds the tweet and thus execute Twitter's widgets.js script?</p>
<h4><a href=\"http://tantek.com/2013/231/b1/questions-twitter-related-headlines-feature#need-cards\">Do related articles have to use Twitter Cards?</a></h4>
<p>Must an article use Twitter Cards meta markup in its <code><head></code> element to show up in a tweet's \"Related headlines\" section?</p>
<p class=\"figure\"><a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2013/new-headlines-feature-offers-story-behind-the-tweet\"><img alt=\"screenshot of a tweet highlighting the Related headlines section\" src=\"http://g.twimg.com/blog/blog/image/headlines_image_JasonCollins.png\" /></a>
</p>
<p>On the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasoncollins34/status/329000293373210625\">example tweet</a>, only 2 out of the first 3 \"Related headlines\" had explicit Twitter Card meta tag markup, though the third did have <a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/The-Open-Graph-protocol\">Facebook Open Graph Protocol</a> (<abbr>OGP</abbr>) meta markup.
</p>
<p>Yet all three of those \"Related headlines\" show a Twitter account name and @-name underneath the display. So how does the article from foxsports.com (without Twitter Card meta markup) get \"FOX Sports\" and \"@FOXSports\" displayed underneath?</p>
<p>Absent Twitter Card meta markup, does Twitter infer which Twitter account to show from the presence of a <code>data-via</code> attribute on a \"Tweet\" (<abbr>AKA</abbr> Twitter Share) button? (which the foxsports.com article does have)
</p>
<p>Absent proprietary Twitter Card or Facebook OGP meta markup, does a \"Related headlines\" entry show information from standards-based markup instead? E.g.:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>name of article</dt>
<dd>from the <code><title></code> element of the page</dd>
<dt>URL of the article</dt>
<dd>from the widgets.js referrer or a <code>rel=canonical</code> link on the page</dd>

<p>In short, is there a purely open standards markup way to have an article included in the \"Related headlines\" on a tweet, or does Twitter require you to add (some form of) proprietary meta markup?
</p>
<h4><a href=\"http://tantek.com/2013/231/b1/questions-twitter-related-headlines-feature#related-to-reply\">Are related headlines shown on reply tweets?</a></h4>
<p>If an article embeds a reply-tweet (either an @-reply or a mention-reply), will that reply-tweet show a \"Related headlines\" section listing that article?</p>
<p>Or do only \"top level\" tweets get a \"Related headlines\" section?</p>
<p>E.g. <span class=\"h-card\">Aaron Parecki</span> posted
<a href=\"http://aaronparecki.com/2013-231-test-embedded-tweet\">a test article</a> that embedded
<a href=\"https://twitter.com/t/statuses/367798983131168768\">a mention-reply tweet of mine</a>.
So far, no \"Related headlines\" section on my tweet. But that could be for any number of reasons (see above).
</p>
<p>He also posted a
<a href=\"http://aaronparecki.com/2013-231-test-embedded-tweet-1\">second test article</a> that embedded
<a href=\"https://twitter.com/t/statuses/368053711794634752\">a top level tweet of mine</a> - and nothing has shown up there yet either. Which brings me to my next question…
</p>
<h4><a href=\"http://tantek.com/2013/231/b1/questions-twitter-related-headlines-feature#related-latency\">How long does it take for an article to show up?</a></h4>
<p>
Once an article embeds a tweet, and publishes it, how long does it take for the tweet's \"Related headlines\" section to display the article?
</p>
<p>Or, how long after you view the article online, does Twitter notice that the article is embedding the tweet? (related to notification above)</p>
<p>Is there a \"views\" threshold? I.e. must the article get some number of views (retrievals of the widgets.js script) for Twitter to consider showing the article in the \"Related headlines\" section?
</p>
<p>One data point: a Techcrunch article \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/david_hamilton/status/369597863635865600\">took 5 hours to show up</a>\".
</p>
<p>Is there some maximum amount of time after which you can be sure your article is not going to show up (for whatever reason)?</p>
<p>In other words, how long do you have to wait to see if embedding the tweet \"worked\" to have your post show up as a related headline, or wonder if there is something wrong with your article?</p>
<p>Which brings me to…</p>
<h4><a href=\"http://tantek.com/2013/231/b1/questions-twitter-related-headlines-feature#no-show-why\">How do you figure out why an article fails to show up?</a></h4>
<p>Once you:</p>
<ol>
<li>publish an article with an embedded tweet</li>
<li>view it on the web</li>
<li>verify that the embedded tweet displays properly in the article</li>
<li>wait (some indeterminate amount of time)</li>
<li>and note the article is not listed in the tweet's \"Related headlines\" section</li>
</ol>
<p>
How do you figure out why and what troubleshooting steps should you take?

<p>Indeed. In IndieWeb terms we call tweets \"<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/notes\">notes</a>\", and when I say IndieWeb terms, I really mean <a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/ActivityStreams\">ActivityStreams</a> terms, as that's where we re-used the term \"notes\" from - just one of <a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/posts\">many kinds of posts</a>.
</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>Clearly he's not happy about Twitter adding \"relevant\" links to his tweets.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to the question: how does a Twitter user turn off the display of \"Related headlines\" section on their tweets?</p>
<p>
Why would a Twitter user want to do that?
E.g. what if you don't want Twitter linking from your <em>tweets</em> to your competitors' <em>articles</em>?
</p>
<p>
This perhaps begs the larger question of, just how much presentational control (or lack thereof) can users of a <a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/silos\">free content hosting service</a> like Twitter expect?

<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_473\" style=\"width: 310px;\"><a href=\"http://dailycavalier.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Discussing-new-UX-concepts.png\"><img alt=\"Discussing new UX concepts\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-473\" height=\"193\" src=\"http://dailycavalier.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Discussing-new-UX-concepts-300x193.png\" width=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Discussing new UX concepts</p></div>
<p>Our sessions took us through the <a href=\"http://dailycavalier.com/2013/08/a-framework-for-designing-a-better-user-experience/\" title=\"A framework for designing a better user experience\">user experience design process</a> we <a href=\"http://www.designstaff.org/articles/product-design-sprint-2012-10-02.html\">adapted</a> from Design Staff, and each session covered one stage — Understand, Diverge, Decide, and Prioritize. The group included people who work on back-end development, front-end development, quality assurance, visual design, product management, web product management and program management.</p>
<p>We started the first session by considering our goals, success metrics and user types. We then reviewed website analytics, research and user feedback to give us additional information. Based on that context we were able to create a problem statement:</p>
<p><strong>We are not making events easy to organize, discover, or measure. We will design a better experience for the core needs of Reps and Mozillians, such as gaining new contributors and supporting Mozilla initiatives.</strong></p>
<p>In our second session, we identified six types of tasks for improving events:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organize</strong>. Make it easy for Mozilla Reps to create and manage events.</li>
<li><strong>Discover</strong>. Make it easy for people to find relevant events.</li>
<li><strong>Measure and validate</strong>. Demonstrate the impact of events and how those events further Mozilla initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate</strong>. Improve information flow with internal/external services.</li>
<li><strong>Promote</strong>. Add ways for users to share events.</li>
<li><strong>Call to action</strong>. Add new calls to action (CTAs) for users.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these tasks in mind, we individually sketched ideas using markers and paper to brainstorm solutions to these tasks. We held another round of sketching to refine the ideas, and then we shared our concepts with the group and discussed them to raise concerns, assumptions and alternative solutions.</p>

<p>Our last two sessions helped us solidify our ideas and decide how we would prioritize them. For our third session we reviewed our seven concepts in more detail and talked through user stories for them. In our last session we prioritized these tasks amongst each other and also talked about how we want to sequence them as part of our work during the rest of this year (Q3 and Q4).</p>
<p>As we wrapped up our sessions on day two, we had a clear understanding of what we want to accomplish and the priorities for implementing those concepts. We will now create specifications for those ideas, prioritize them amongst our other non-events projects and identify any other resources we need. In a short amount of time, we certainly accomplished a lot!</p>" nil nil "5a934ddc430db224a52606430fd07301") (631 (21011 9124 394685) "http://bluishcoder.co.nz/2013/08/20/progress-towards-media-source-extensions-in-firefox.html" "Chris Double: Progress Towards Media Source Extensions in Firefox" nil "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 22:35:35 +0000" "<p>There is a W3C editors draft for <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-media/raw-file/tip/media-source/media-source.html\">Media Source Extensions</a> that provides a way for web applications to generate media streams for playback from JavaScript. This allows a number of new use cases on the web. A couple of examples might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media players that download encrypted content from a server, decode the data on the client using JavaScript, and send that data to the video player in a page.</li>
<li>JavaScript implementations of adaptive streaming (for example, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP\">MPEG-DASH</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Work has been ongoing in Firefox to implement the specification. The majority of the work has been done by <a href=\"http://blog.mjg.im/\">Matthew Gregan</a>. The tracking bug for this is <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778617\">bug 778617</a>. The dependancies of that bug list what needs to be implemented to complete support. Basic support is available in Firefox since <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=855130\">bug 855130</a> landed.</p>
<p>That allows <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/mse/mediasource_demo.html\">mediasource_demo.html</a> to run in Firefox (that demo was originally from the <a href=\"http://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/media-source.html\">URL mentioned in the bug report</a> but hosted locally to have a stable source for testing).</p>
<p>The demo takes an existing VP8 encoded WebM file and splits it into five chunks, each chunk stored in a JavaScript typed array. The code looks like (reorganised from the demo for readability):</p>
<pre><code>var mediaSource = new MediaSource();
var video = document.getElementById('video');
video.src = window.URL.createObjectURL(mediaSource);
var sourceBuffer = mediaSource.addSourceBuffer('video/webm; codecs=\"vorbis,vp8\"');
var reader = new FileReader();
var file = new Blob([uInt8Array], {type: 'video/webm'});
var chunk = file.slice(startByte, startByte + chunkSize);
reader.onload = function(e) {
sourceBuffer.appendBuffer(new Uint8Array(e.target.result));
if (i == NUM_CHUNKS - 1) {
mediaSource.endOfStream();
}
}
reader.readAsArrayBuffer(chunk);</code></pre>
<p>The <code>createObjectUrl</code> results in a blob URL that contains the media source data that is appended via source buffers. Playing the video using the standard HTML media API will result in it decoding and playing the binary data we’ve manually appended to the media source.</p>
<p>To run this demo you’ll need to enable Media Source Extensions as it’s currently switched off. Setting <code>media.mediasource.enabled</code> to <code>true</code> in <code>about:config</code> will turn it on. You’ll want to use a nightly build to ensure you have the Media Source code and followup fixes.</p>
<p>Real world usage of Media Source extensions is more involved than that demo and there is much more to do. If you’re interested in tracking progress you might like to track <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778617\">bug 778617</a>. Support for a more advanced player is tracked in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881512\">bug 881512</a>. Completion of that bug should provide enough of the specification to run an <a href=\"http://dash-mse-test.appspot.com/dash-player.html\">MPEG-DASH Media Source demo</a> where the MPEG-DASH code is implemented in JavaScript. This is one of the main goals at the moment.</p>
<p>Other browsers are also supporting Media Source Extensions. The MPEG-DASH demo currently runs in Chrome. The <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/bg182646%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\">IE 11 preview</a> implements MPEG-DASH support using Media Source Extensions. It’ll be interesting to see what other uses web developers will find for this functionality once support becomes widely available.</p>" nil nil "5067487c1b7df84e88459853b3d135d5") (630 (21011 9124 393830) "http://dailycavalier.com/2013/08/a-framework-for-designing-a-better-user-experience/" "William Reynolds: A framework for designing a better user experience" "William" "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 22:28:01 +0000" "<p>The Mozilla Reps website team recently met to plan how to make our event tools easier and more valuable. We are a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping\">bootstrapping</a> team, so this is the first time that we have worked closely with user experience and visual design experts <a href=\"http://hollyhabstritt.com/\">Holly</a> and <a href=\"https://mozillians.org/u/leetom/\">Lee</a>. This opportunity was a special treat for our team, and I think it also gives us a strong framework for improving the user experience in other areas of the Reps Portal. I am going to use this post to share the process we used, and I believe other teams can benefit from using this approach as well.</p>
<h4>Defining our process</h4>
<p>To guide us through our sprint, we adapted the <a href=\"http://www.designstaff.org/articles/product-design-sprint-2012-10-02.html\">product design sprint five-day recipe</a> from the good people at Design Staff. We changed the recipe a bit since we were meeting remotely and not creating a prototype just yet. Overall the team really liked this approach.</p>
<h4>Planning</h4>
<p>To help us prepare for the meetings, Holly shared guide documents detailing the sessions and included questions for us to think about in advance. We also created a quick survey for Mozilla Reps, our main users, to give us feedback and ideas about event functionality on the Reps Portal. The responses we received gave us some great insights that drove our discussion and concepts. Before the meetings each of us was asked to look at other event sites for inspiration as well.</p>
<h4>Sessions</h4>
<p>We met for four two-hour sessions on Monday and Tuesday, and each session was focused on a different stage of the user experience design process. During these meetings we discussed, brainstormed, sketched, conceptualized and identified assumptions and concerns. We started by defining our opportunity and finished by prioritizing our new concepts and solutions. This is a thorough process that helps the team gain a common understanding of what we want to accomplish and then find solutions we can use. Here’s what we set out to do in each session:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand</strong>. Dig into the design problem through research, competitive review, and strategy exercises. End up with user story that we all agree on to move forward.</li>
<li><strong>Diverge</strong>. Rapidly develop as many solutions as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Decide</strong>. Choose the best ideas and hammer out our user stories.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize</strong>. Choose what order to work on ideas.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Working virtually</h4>
<p>Our team is spread out around the world, so we used Vidyo video conferencing to meet in a virtual room and we created a shared folder of documents and images for each step in the process. Because our team spans eight timezones, not everyone could join every session, but at the start of each session we reviewed our previous work so everyone had the same context.</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_469\" style=\"width: 310px;\"><a href=\"http://dailycavalier.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lee-Tom-sharing-his-idea-over-Vidyo.jpg\"><img alt=\"Sharing our ideas over video\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-469\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://dailycavalier.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lee-Tom-sharing-his-idea-over-Vidyo-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sharing our ideas over video</p></div>
<p>To share our designs and ideas, we made heavy use of screen sharing and showing paper sketches using webcams. While we took lots of notes, I found the paper sketches to be the most useful tool for our sessions. In a few minutes we could draw out ideas and share concepts with each other. We also took photos of all the sketches that we added to our shared documents folder.</p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>Now that we have a solid understanding of how we want to improve our event tools, we can start executing on our concepts. In the next week we will start creating specifications and filing bugs. We’ll prioritize our events work amongst our other Reps Portal projects as well.</p>" nil nil "00868f90a2b2acfa9a9b3b1c9dac2bfc") (629 (21011 9124 392984) "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/InPursuitOfMysteries/Mozilla/~3/WCK_6cDbxNY/" "Al Billings: Boing Boing Ingenuity was great" nil "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 21:00:00 +0000" "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/9541405937/\" title=\"IMG_4770 by albill, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"IMG_4770\" height=\"375\" src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2827/9541405937_9caa07f2e1.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>
<p>I managed to go to <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/tag/ingenuity\">Boing Boing: Ingenuity</a> this weekend. This was a one day hackathon followed by \"vaudeville for geeks\" set of presentations and performances yesterday. I actually missed the hackathon on the first day because I wound up having my birthday BBQ for my 42nd birthday (which is today) on Saturday and I'm kind of a crappy coder anyway. This was an invitation event but a free one (sponsored by Ford but it was a low-key sponsorship). I wasn't sure what to expect before I arrived.</p>
<p>Yesterday's event was very cool but also very odd, in a way. I kept trying to figure out the demographics of the group there (as one does…) because it was this mix of hackerspace people that I knew, makers, inventors, artists of various sorts, and happy mutants of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacophony_Society\">cacophony society</a> sort. I ran into fellow hackerspace founders, including the BioCurious folks, embedded systems programers (who were also musicians), authors, designers, and artists.</p>
<p>The events included presentations by designers, musical performances, talks about SETI, a mentalist, the founding of BioCurious and a variety of other things.</p>
<p>I would say that I most enjoyed two particular presentations.</p>
<p>One was near the beginning and that was <a href=\"http://about.me/christophernoessel\">Chris Noessel</a> presenting on user interfaces in science fiction (specifically movies) drawing from his work for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Make-It-So-Nathan-Shedroff/dp/1933820985/\">Make It So</a>, the book he co-wrote on the topic and documented on his <a href=\"http://www.scifiinterfaces.com/\">website</a> for it. Chris is a friend of a friend and I last saw him debating over beer after the most recent Batman movie about how certain things <strong>made no sense (!!)</strong> in the movie. I've heard him mention his work on science fiction but hadn't actually seen any of it so it was cool (and pretty amusing) to see him present.</p>
<p>The last session of the day is the other that I really enjoyed. This was by <a href=\"http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters\">Mythbusters'</a> Adam Savage (and now <a href=\"http://www.tested.com/\">tested.com</a> on being a maker. A couple of the anecdoates in it I'd heard before, probably when he spoke at Defcon, but I enjoyed his voice over of his ten rules for success. I find these rather inspirational even if I've never managed to follow all of them!</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Get good at something.</strong> <br /><br /><em>Really good. Get good at as many things as you can. Being good at one thing makes it easier to get good at other things.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Getting good at stuff takes practice.</strong><br /><br /><em>Lots and lots of practice.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get OBSESSED.</strong><br /><br /><em>Everyone at the top of their field is obsessed with what they're doing.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Doing something well and thoroughly is its OWN reward.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Show and Tell.</strong><br /><br /><em>If you do something well and you're happy with it, for FSM's sake, tell EVERYONE.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you want something, ASK.</strong><br /><br /><em>If something piques your interest, tell someone. If you want to learn something, ask someone, like your BOSS. As an employer, I can tell you, people who want to learn new skills are people I want to keep employed.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have GOALS.</strong><br /><br /><em>Make up goals. Set goals. Regularly assess where you are and where you want to be in terms of them.

<li><p><strong>Be nice. To EVERYONE.</strong><br /><br /><em>Life is way too short to be an asshole. If you are an asshole, apologize.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>FAIL.</strong><br /><br /><em>You will fail. It's one of our jobs in life. Keep failing. When you fail, admit it. When you don't, don't get cocky. 'Cause you're just about to fail again.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>WORK YOUR ASS OFF.</strong><br /><br /><em>Work like your life depends on it…</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>As someone who spends a lot of his life at a hackerspace, thinking about hackerspaces, and actually trying to make things (and my professional life in kind of a related context), this was both useful and a lot of fun. I think younger makers, especially, could really learn a lot by following these rules.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if Boing Boing: Ingenuity was a one-off event or the eventual building to more events but I'm very glad that I was invited to attend and got to experience it. I think that there are only a few places in the world where you could get this particular mix of mutants together and it was cool to be a part of it.</p>

<p>The Firefox for Android team is embarking on a new experiment towards improving our already-pretty-great integration of UX design & innovation into our product development process.</p>
<p>We’re doing this by introducing a couple of new & slightly more formal steps to the beginning of our feature definition process:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Brief</b>: collaboratively develop a creative brief (Product & UX)</li>
<li><b>Brainstorm</b>: create and flesh out a couple of design concepts (UX)</li>
<li><b>Refine</b>: expand upon & fine-tune those design concepts (UX & Product)</li>
<li><b>Pitch</b>: present those concepts to the team as a whole to see which concept (or parts of the concepts) we want to explore further (UX & Product)</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, we’re back into our regular feature definition & development process, where Product, UX, and Engineering work together to flesh out, iterate on, and build the selected design concepts.</p>
<p>We’re doing this experiment for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First, it will simplify and clarify the interaction between Product and UX — UX will always have a solid idea of what Product is looking for in terms of feature innovation and design work, and it will make it easier for Product to clearly provide that direction.</p>
<p>Second, it will make our feature pipeline more efficient — using this expanded process, we believe that we’ll be able to have more features ready for engineering more quickly, so there will always be a healthy and curated backlog of new and interesting projects that both paid and volunteer contributors can pick up and start hacking on.</p>
<p>For now, we’re going start with this experiment with one longer-term feature (exploring the idea of a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Projects/Kinderfox\">kid-friendly “flavour” of Firefox for Android</a>), and a few smaller more focused features (TBD). We’re all pretty excited about trying something new around this, and we’ll be blogging our progress and results so you can all follow along.</p>
<p>As always, you can find the Firefox for Android team in the #mobile IRC channel if you have any questions or just want to chat & hang out.</p>
<p>Next post: What our creative brief is going to look like!</p>

<p>As an long-time feminist activist, I have felt tremendous relief from the amount of peer support I’ve gained from working with The Ada Initiative.

I deeply appreciate the professional commitment of everyone at TAI and everyone I met at AdaCamp! That’s part of why I’m posting to ask you to donate.

This continues a series of new features introduced in Firefox 24, which I <a href=\"http://www.marcozehe.de/2013/06/21/new-features-for-talkback-users-in-firefox-for-android-24/\">blogged</a> about earlier.</p>
<h3>New reading order</h3>
<p>As hinted in my blog post about Firefox 24 new features, we have now made a change to the default reading order of web elements. If you did not make any adjustments, you will get this new reading order as soon as you update to Firefox 25. Now, the current item’s label is spoken first, followed by its role and states, and any changed hierarchical information is now appended at the end. This allows for a much more efficient browsing experience in our opinion.</p>
<p>If you want to change it back, follow the steps given in the other blog post.</p>
<h3>Support for landmarks</h3>
<p>Firefox for Android now supports landmarks. It speaks the landmark that you just entered, and an option has been added to the three finger swipe up and down menu to move by landmark quick navigation. If you use a keyboard, the quick navigation key is <kbd>d</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+d</kbd>, similar as in the NVDA screen reader for Windows.</p>
<h3>Support for data tables</h3>
<p>Firefox for Android 25 supports data tables. If you enter a data table, column and row headers are spoken, if a cell spans multiple columns or rows, this is also announced, as well as the table dimensions and any caption and/or summary, too. When traversing a table element by element, only the necessary information that changed is read. So if you move from column 2 to column 3, but stay within the same row, the new column header is read, but the row header is not repeated. Likewise if you stay in column 3 and move to the next row, the new row header will be announced, but the column header will not, because it did not change.</p>
<h3>Suppression of layout tables</h3>
<p>Firefox has had a heuristic to determine if a table on a web page might be there solely for layout purposes. While not encountered very often nowadays, it still happens occasionally. Now if such a layout table is encountered, Firefox will suppress speaking of any table or table cell information as to not flood you with unnecessary information.</p>
<h3>Speaking of additional information, if available</h3>
<p>Sometimes, web authors provide additional information via the title attribute, an aria-describedby statement or some other means that is not the primary label or text for an element, but which, on the desktop, becomes visible when hovering the mouse over the element. This information is stored for screen readers in something we call the AccessibleDescription. Unlike the AccessibleName, which is the primary label or text, you can think of the AccessibleDescription as an addendum. Since there is no real concept of an AccessibleDescription in Android itself, we made a compromise and add this AccessibleDescription if it is there, and if it is different from the AccessibleName. Some web authors unnecessarily put the same text of a link or image in the title as they do in the enclosing text or alt text respectively. We detect that and suppress the redundant info. But if there is true additional information, it will now be appended to the name in the now default reading order. In the old reading order, it will be prepended, since it will honour the setting.</p>
<h3>Support for switching movement granularities</h3>
<p>It is now possible to traverse through text on a web page by character, word, or paragraph using the usual TalkBack gestures in Jelly Bean. Switch your granularity to one of these modes and swipe left and right to move, spell, or read word by word.</p>
<h3>More braille features</h3>
<p>In addition to the braille output introduced in Firefox 24, Firefox 25 also brings a cursor indicator, and you can move the cursor via braille routing keys. Also, if you type something into a text field on the web, braille will now update properly to show you what you typed.</p>
<h3>Better support for web applications reacting to touch events</h3>
<p>Mobile web applications such as <a href=\"http://mobile.twitter.com\">Mobile Twitter</a> will now work much better for TalkBack users. Before, it could happen that if you double-tapped nick names or tweets in your timeline, nothing would happen. Now, we correctly pass on touch events, which Mobile Twitter expects, so you can do things such as reply, retweet and other actions pertaining to the current tweet, view the user profile etc.</p>
<h3>Better touch targets</h3>
<p>Firefox for Android now allows for a better explore by touch experience by improving the discoverability of certain web elements such as plain text.</p>
<h3>…and more</h3>
<p>There have also been bits and pieces added, changed, and optimised to make reading web content more reliable, especially if there are frames and iframes involved.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll enjoy these new features! Happy browsing!</p>

<p>More than five years ago I started managing a team. Five years later I wasn’t so much as managing a team of 60 as I was <em><b>leading</b></em> a team of 60.</p>
<p>There’s a big difference between the two words <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">managing</span> & <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">leading</span>. One is much harder than the other. One is tactical. A means to an end. Book knowledge.</p>

<blockquote style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><em>man·ag·er</em> [ˈmanijər]<br /> <strong><em>noun</em></strong>: someone who works to get their employees to do what they did yesterday, but a little faster and a little cheaper; <em>wants authority</em></p>

<p>The other is <strong>empowering</strong>. It is a way of <strong>mentoring</strong> and <strong>teaching</strong>. It is about <strong>inspiring</strong> others to follow into the unknown. To take <strong>risks</strong>. To <a href=\"http://mrz.velvet.org/2013/03/28/failure/\" title=\"failure\">accept failure</a>. <em>To require failure</em>.</p>
<p>For those who on paper I manage, it is more than simply a means to an end.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">It’s about me focusing on you – <strong>my tribe</strong> – and only on you.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">It’s about me being <strong>authentic</strong> & <strong>vulnerable</strong>. It’s about me <strong>trusting</strong> you.</p>

<p>Here’s the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/selenamarie/fc4588ff594576f86982\">gist version for easier reading</a>.</p>
<p>The couple things I learned in this process was a nice feature in <code>substring()</code> allowing me to return the date portion of my partition names easily, and <code>split_part()</code> which allowed me to return the parent table name and compare it to my list of partitionable tables for the specific partition column. I recently added support for partitioning on a different column for certain tables, so I have to differentiate for this fix. The <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/functions-string.html\">string function docs</a> are pretty great.</p>
<p>I didn’t do any optimization of this — just got it working and am now testing it in our stage environment. The final script is going to perform the changes on a month’s worth of partitions at a time to help reduce the chance of deadlocking.</p>

<p>Before I get to the other work that’s been going on, I need to talk about how cross-language communication works in Firefox for Android.</p>
<p>Firefox for Android uses three primary languages: C++ for Gecko, Java for the Android UI and related bits, and JavaScript for all sorts of things.  Java and C++ play nicely via JNI, and Javascript and C++ talk to each other via XPCOM.  But what happens when Java needs to talk to JS or vice versa?  The solution that’s been chosen here is that Java constructs and serializes a JSON message, sends that to C++, which then notifies observers that a particular kind of message has been received.  Registered JavaScript observers (you could also do this in C++, of course, but it’s just easier to do it in JavaScript) are then invoked, parse the JSON, and do their thing.  And of course there’s a reverse path for sending things from JavaScript to Java.</p>
<p>With that being said, you might not be surprised that Chris Kitching identified that <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=903553\">JSON parsing and serialization are slowing down startup</a>. We spend nearly 200ms doing JSON operations on a Galaxy Nexus–just in Java, never mind JavaScript (though the JavaScript JSON bits are quite fast because they’re backed by C++ code).  Part of this is because <a href=\"http://www.json.org/java/index.html\">the interface that Android uses for JSON</a> is not well-designed and part of this is because the implementation could be improved (though Android does not use the json.org implementation, both could be improved).  Part of this is also because we do things like JSON-wrap single integers when there are much more efficient ways to communicate such values.  I’ve been fixing up some small hotspots (warmspots?), starting with <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=905759\">sending telemetry information</a> and <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=906088\">Java’s requests for preferences information</a>.</p>
<p>For some things, however, we do have to deal with JSON.  Firefox for Android <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=903553#c26\">twiddles with the sessionstore information</a> before forwarding it to JavaScript, and sending the sessionstore information in any other format than JSON would be…tedious.  The twiddling itself is not particularly expensive, but the reading/parsing/serialization required around it is.  For a smallish session of six tabs, where we only have ~2KB of sessionstore JSON to deal with, reading/parsing/serializing the data takes almost 250ms on a Galaxy Nexus.  This is expensive enough that techniques like <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=905223\">parsing it on a background thread</a> might be worthwhile.  It’s not entirely clear whether it helps (different profiling tools say different things, single-core devices may not benefit from it, etc.), though.</p>" nil nil "0c542ef74173c45fab9bd1c3948c2bae") (610 (21009 53399 493479) "https://shanetomlinson.com/2013/persona-browserid-wordpress-plugin-45/" "Shane Tomlinson: v0.45 Release of the Persona WordPress Plugin" "Shane Tomlinson" "Tue, 13 Aug 2013 09:57:10 +0000" "<p>Today I released v0.45 of the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/browserid/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Persona WordPress Plugin\">Persona WordPress plugin</a>.

<h3>Improved Site Branding</h3>
<p>The Persona dialog can be customized with your site’s branding by specifying a site name, site logo, and now, <a href=\"http://identity.mozilla.com/post/55796551587/persona-a-login-that-matches-your-site\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Persona - A login that matches your site\">background color</a>.

<h3>Elimination of comment spam</h3>
<p>With the “Enable for comments” option selected, the <a href=\"https://login.persona.org\" target=\"_blank\">Persona</a> plugin helps eliminate comment spam. A Persona account will be required to leave comments, a requirement that automated bots do not yet have. Until bot writers wisen up, Persona keeps spam at bay.</p>

I realy believe that it’s helping, and wil continue to help!</p>
<p>Personally I <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/donate/?\">donate monthly to The Ada Initiative</a> as well as participating on its <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/about-us/advisors/\">advisory board</a>. Over the past couple of years I’ve benefitted directly from The Ada Initiative as I see conference after conference put <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/conference-policies/\">anti-harassment policies into place</a>, which TAI has worked hard to facilitate.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer I had an amazing experience at <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/events/\">AdaCamp </a> in San Francisco. The Melbourne and DC AdaCamps bore fruit too, as they connected so many women in open tech and culture with the communities I’m already part of, and made us visible to each other. </p>
<p>The synergy from the feminist hackerspace discussions at AdaCamp SF led to the first meeting for a new feminist hacker and maker space in San Francisco. After a whole weekend of talking at AdaCamp, it was like we couldn’t stop!  I ended up with a dozen or so fierce activist women in my living room describing their vision for how we could make actual physical room for our projects and ourselves, a space we would invent, define, and maintain. It was really a dream come true.</p>
<p>As an long-time feminist activist, I have felt tremendous relief from the amount of peer support I’ve gained from working with The Ada Initiative. The people who are part of TAI have a tremendously sophisticated view of what we’re doing and why we’re doing it, and what we need to make it happen. I deeply appreciate the professional commitment of everyone at TAI and everyone I met at AdaCamp! That’s part of why I’m posting to ask you to donate. It’s important to make support for women in free and open source tech and culture truly part of our infrastructure. We can do that by funding that work! Here’s some <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/faq/donation-help-and-faq/\">ways to donate</a>!</p>

<h3>The CSA</h3>
<p>This past January I started working with my former colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thunder\">@thunder</a> (currently at <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons</a>) and my friend and then current colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/solarce\">@solarce</a> (Mozilla Webops) on what it would be like to have an organization comprised of volunteer SysAdmins who would lend their time to help manage infrastructure & systems for open source and public benefit organizations. Not too unlike the <a href=\"http://osuosl.org/\">Open Source Lab</a> but extending to not just open source projects but organizations like Creative Commons or Mozilla.</p>
<p>We called this Community SysAdmins or <strong>CSA</strong>.</p>
<p>Some of the thinking that went into the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_2MMjRYacNEDcqhtpBmdh63Tz0cxKi2R1U-xEpU4Ng/pub\">January draft</a> was based on our collective experiences at Mozilla, especially around organizational governance – modules and module owners, for example.</p>
<p>My thoughts around this continued and I began to think more about reasons why Community IT within Mozilla hadn’t taken off. Or why it had taken off very slowly.</p>
<p>I started to see a model where it could work and it was not unlike the Mozilla Reps model.</p>

<ul>
<li>CSA <del>Advisory Board</del> Leadership Council (~ ReMo council)</li>
<li>Core group of Community SysAdmin Mentors (~ Mozilla Reps)</li>
<li>Community IT/SysAdmin/Ops volunteers (~ Mozilla contributors)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rebooting Community IT with CSA</h3>
<p>As we start thinking about what it means to <em>Reboot Community IT</em>, I want to share the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_2MMjRYacNEDcqhtpBmdh63Tz0cxKi2R1U-xEpU4Ng/pub\">draft CSA proposal</a> we created and re-ask these <em>modified</em> five questions I asked in <a href=\"http://mrz.velvet.org/2013/08/14/rebooting-community-it-part-2/\" title=\"Rebooting Community IT, Part 2\">Part 2</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>What impact does this group want to have on <em>open source projects and public benefit organizations</em>?</li>
<li>How do we become a force multiplier for <em>your organization</em>?</li>
<li>What are our 9-12 month goals and objectives?</li>
<li>How do we do it?</li>
<li>How do we work with <em>your existing</em> IT Operations as partners?</li>
</ol>
<p>And ask one more:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we create the CSA to support organizations like Mozilla or Creative Commons, for example?</li>
</ol>

It is crucial, of course, to never present any individual decision as written in stone. In the comments associated with each assignment of an issue to a specific future release, invite discussion, dissent, and be genuinely willing to be persuaded whenever possible. Never exercise control merely for the sake of exercising control: the more deeply others participate in the release planning process (see the section called “Share Management Tasks as Well as Technical Tasks” in Chapter 8, Managing Volunteers), the easier it will be to persuade them to share your priorities on the issues that really count for you.

<p>1) We need a few more tens of thousands of users (so Thunderbird get’s tested with AVs, Anti-spam solutions etc …) so raise our low rate of 0.43% of beta users compared to mainstream users.

That’s easier than 1 as you can just use a test account with no “important” emails in it.

<p>Now we’ve stepped further and there are significant improvements.  I was also able to test with more various hardware this time.</p>
<p>The most significant difference is a single I/O thread with relatively simple event prioritization.  Opening and reading urgent (render-blocking) files is done first, opening and reading less priority files after that and writing is performed as the last operation. This greatly improves performance when loading from non-warmed cache and also first paint time in many scenarios.</p>
<p>The numbers are much more precise then in the first post.  My measuring is more systematic and careful by now.  Also, I’ve merged gum with latest mozilla-central code few times and there are for sure some improvements too.</p>
<p>Here are the results, I’m using 50MB limit for keeping cached stuff in RAM.</p>

<p>To sum – most significant changes appear when using a really slow media.  For sure, first paint times greatly improves, not talking about the 10000% better UI responsiveness!  Still, space left for more optimizations.  We know what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>deliver data in larger chunks ; now we fetch only by 16kB blocks, hence larger files (e.g. images) load very slowly</li>
<li>think of interaction with upper levels by means of having some kind of an intelligent flood control</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><sup>1</sup>) Open a new tab and navigate to a page when the cache is already pre-warmed, i.e. data are already fully in RAM.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><sup>2</sup>) Open a new tab and navigate to a page right after the Firefox start.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">* I was testing with my blog home page.  There are few large images, ~750kB and ~600kB.  Delivering data to upper level consumers only by 16kB chunks causes this suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">** This is an interesting regression.  Sometimes with the new backend we delay first paint and overall load time.  Seems like the cache engine is ‘too good’ and opens the floodgate too much overwhelming the main thread event queue.  Needs more investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">*** Here it’s combination of flood fill of the main thread with image loads, slow image data load it self and fact, that in this case we first paint after all resources on the page loaded – that needs to change.  It’s also supported by fact that cold load first paint time is significantly faster on microSD then on SSD.  The slow card apparently simulates the flood control here for us.</span></p>" nil nil "a83334e8de49d9b2c6380ae67a37769e") (598 (21006 2928 594474) "http://bookmaniac.org/supporting-the-ada-initiative-and-making-more-room/" "Liz Henry: Supporting The Ada Initiative, and making more room" "Liz Henry" "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 03:37:21 +0000" "<p>People ask me all the time what they can do to help change our culture.

<h3>The CSA</h3>
<p>This past January I started working with my former colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thunder\">@thunder</a> (currently at <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons</a>) and my friend and then current colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/solarce\">@solarce</a> (Mozilla Webops) on what it would be like to have an organization comprised of volunteer SysAdmins who would lend their time to help manage infrastructure & systems for open source and public benefit organizations. Not too unlike the <a href=\"http://osuosl.org/\">Open Source Lab</a> but extending to not just open source projects but organizations like Creative Commons or Mozilla.</p>
<p>We called this Community SysAdmins or <strong>CSA</strong>.</p>
<p>Some of the thinking that went into the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_2MMjRYacNEDcqhtpBmdh63Tz0cxKi2R1U-xEpU4Ng/pub\">January draft</a> was based on our collective experiences at Mozilla, especially around organizational governance – modules and module owners, for example.</p>
<p>My thoughts around this continued and I began to think more about reasons why Community IT within Mozilla hadn’t taken off. Or why it had taken off very slowly.</p>
<p>I started to see a model where it could work and it was not unlike the Mozilla Reps model.</p>

<h3>Rebooting Community IT with CSA</h3>
<p>As we start thinking about what it means to <em>Reboot Community IT</em>, I want to share the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_2MMjRYacNEDcqhtpBmdh63Tz0cxKi2R1U-xEpU4Ng/pub\">draft CSA proposal</a> we created and re-ask these <em>modified</em> five questions I asked in <a href=\"http://mrz.velvet.org/2013/08/14/rebooting-community-it-part-2/\" title=\"Rebooting Community IT, Part 2\">Part 2</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>What impact does this group want to have on <em>open source projects and public benefit organizations</em>?</li>
<li>How do we become a force multiplier for <em>your organization</em>?</li>
<li>What are our 9-12 month goals and objectives?</li>
<li>How do we do it?</li>
<li>How do we work with <em>your existing</em> IT Operations as partners?</li>
</ol>
<p>And ask one more:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we create the CSA to support organizations like Mozilla or Creative Commons, for example?</li>

"Hoosteeno" "Thu, 15 Aug 2013 21:39:41 +0000" "<p>In <a href=\"http://hoosteeno.com/2013/04/24/a-drawing-of-a-house/\">an earlier post</a> I described a project that produced a perfectly good result, but not the result required. This is inevitable — it will happen to everyone buying or selling creative work — and it can be quite demoralizing. As someone in the business of delivering custom services or products, figuring out what people want is the most challenging, most important thing you can do. And you can do it by repeating a single mantra.</p>
<p>A friend once asked a capable carpenter to install a door over a hole in the drywall of her basement where some plumbing valves were accessed. After a day of work she was <em>aghast</em> to discover that the carpenter had bought a full-sized closet door, built a frame for it, drywalled the frame, painted it and even installed a doorknob. The work was high quality and fairly priced. But she wanted a tiny little access hatch — a foot square, maybe — not a giant closet door. She paid the carpenter’s bill, then hired another carpenter to tear the door down and put in a little access hatch.</p>
<p>This has probably happened to you, too. Have you ever realized when your food arrived in a restaurant that you were hungry for something different? Have you ever begrudgingly paid for a service (a haircut, say) that is acceptable, but not what you really wanted?</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/25576401@N07/9429283456/\" title=\"what a mistake by Roo.LBG, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"what a mistake\" height=\"375\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3736/9429283456_48cea18dbd.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>
<p>It is easy to say, “The carpenter should have known his customer wanted a little access door, not a big closet door.” And maybe he should have. But should the barber have known what haircut you had in mind? Should the server have guessed that you wanted a different entree than the one you ordered?</p>
<p>Surely at some point in your journey you’ve thrown away days or weeks of work after a new detail or requirement emerged at the last minute. Almost everyone has. Why didn’t you know what to produce the first time?</p>
<p>Well, it’s because knowing what people want when they ask for something is <em>hard</em>. People often don’t know what they want, or don’t know how to ask for it. Delivering what they actually want requires you to interpret many layers of motivation and establish a shared understanding of the actual desire.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/narisa/410246206/\" title=\"Arrow on flyer layers by Narisa, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Arrow on flyer layers\" height=\"375\" src=\"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/130/410246206_b1bb50fc06.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>
<p>Some of us are born with an innate ability to understand what people want very quickly. Others learn to do so by mastering a particular domain. Occasionally a shared understanding is based on a long relationship — it is easier to anticipate your friends than it is to anticipate strangers, after all. But for most of us, on most projects, establishing a shared understanding requires hard work. The sooner we do this work on a project, the less effort we waste.</p>
<p>Every project has a<strong> desired outcome</strong> — it’s<strong> </strong>one of the principal characteristics of a project. But in countless projects, the stated outcome would never be enough on its own to satisfy the sponsor or customer. Consider the following common projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redesign the website</li>
<li>Rewrite the application using Python</li>
<li>Make a a new logo</li>
</ul>
<p>They seem quite clear, don’t they? They’re just as obvious as, “Put a door over the hole in the wall.” It’s simple: Buy a door, frame it in, do some finish work. Make some new website designs that the customer likes. Reproduce the functionality in Python. Keep drawing logos until the customer likes one. Done and done, right?</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-b/6328605299/\" title=\"Lorde Gelo by tom-b, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Lorde Gelo\" height=\"354\" src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6058/6328605299_56208d8d05.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>
<p>Bah. That isn’t a list of <em>desired outcomes</em>, it’s a list of<em> implementation details</em>. Those aren’t <em>ends</em>, they’re <em>means</em>. They’re the work you — the expert — do when you’re trying to deliver the thing. But they’re definitely not the thing you’re trying to deliver.</p>
<p><strong>When someone asks you to redesign their website, ask them “Why?”</strong>.  They must have something in mind, something they think will happen if you redesign their website. How can you do a good job if you don’t know what that thing is? And when they say, “To make it look more modern,” you say, “Why?” Again, they must have some reason to believe they need a modern-looking website. And when they say, “So more people will visit the site and stay longer,” you say, “Why?” “Because if more people visit the site and stay longer, I can join a better advertising network.” “Why?”</p>
<p>Eventually, after playing 3-year-old for long enough, you’ll have your answer: “Because advertisements on this site are how I make my money, and I’m not hitting my goals right now.” Aha! It has nothing to do with modern design. Design is just an implementation detail. The customer wants to show different advertisements and thereby increase revenues; they think they can get there with a new site design; and they’re willing to invest in that theory. Now you can actually apply your expertise to the customer’s needs. Now you’re <a href=\"http://theheretic.me/2013/07/25/are-you-solving-the-right-problem/\">solving the right problem</a>.</p>
<p>Almost always, asking “Why?” will reveal how faulty the initial project description was, and how far off-track you might have gone if you didn’t ask. That’s when you get to demonstrate the hard-won experience of a craftsman:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ktlindsay/3762817571/\" title=\"The Cutler's Hands by kT LindSAy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"The Cutler's Hands\" height=\"336\" src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2475/3762817571_1482111cff.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>“You don’t need to rebuild the application in Python. You just need to add indexes to your database.”</li>
<li>“You don’t need a new logo, you need different colors.”</li>
<li>“You don’t actually want me to install a door there. You just need to cover this hole in the wall with a little access hatch, right?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Extracting enough information to build the right thing can take a lot of time and may require asking and answering the same question over and over. During this exercise it sometimes feels like nothing is happening at all. But what is happening means everything to your project.</p>
<p><strong><em>Postscript:</em></strong><br />
<em> Sometimes, this approach simply won’t reveal the information you need to deliver a good project. And, unfortunately, you won’t know that until you’ve already done some work. So, in another blog post I will explain how inexpensive prototypes can help. Hint: Building the wrong thing allows you to ask, “Why not?”</em></p>

installation.  Work on BMO is continuous and incremental, and even really
useful features often take a while to percolate through the community, so I
thought I’d try to draw attention to some recent improvements that should
get you pumped to open a Bugzilla tab.</p>
<h3>Suggested Reviewers</h3>
<p>A really exciting, and long-awaited, feature is suggested reviewers.  Now
when you flag a patch for review, you see a list of people who should make
good candidates.  And as of today, you can even see the number of reviews
in each person’s queue!  There is a lot more in this feature, with even more
to come, so I’ll just run down a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>The set of reviewers is per Product and per Component.  If there are
reviewers set for the particular Component, they are used; otherwise, it
defaults to that Product’s reviewer set.</li>
<li>The full set is available as a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=review_suggestions.html\">report</a> within Bugzilla.  Anyone with
“editcomponents” permission on a Product can change reviewers for that Product
or its Components.  Changes can also be requested by <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration&format=__default__\">filing a bug</a> or
dropping by #bteam and talking directly to glob or dkl.</li>
<li>The order of the suggested reviewers is identical to how it appears in the
report, which can be modified as above.</li>
<li>Anyone with “away”, “PTO”, or “unavailable” in their “real name” field
will not be listed.</li>
<li>Any bug that has a mentor set ([mentor=X] in the whiteboard) will
automatically have that user included in the suggested reviewers, at the
top, in bold, since presumably that person is best suited for this
particular bug.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming down the pipe is the ability to assign reviewers to subcategories of
a particular component, which will show up beside the reviewer’s name in the
list.  Thus for components like Mochitest, you could indicate that a
reviewer is particularly suited to b2g-specific parts of the framework.  This
avoids having to create tonnes of smaller components just for reviewing
purposes.</p>
<h3>Gravatars and the Sandstone Skin</h3>
<p>There is now an option to display Gravatars beside comment headers.  As with
any Gravatar-enabled site, the avatar is displayed if the commenter’s
bugmail address has an associated Gravatar.  At the moment it is opt-in,
enabled from the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi\">Preferences</a> page (General Preferences / Show gravatar
images when viewing bugs), but when the Sandstone skin becomes the default,
Gravatars will be enabled for all users—but of course you can opt out if you
really don’t like them.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Sandstone skin, some more improvements to it have landed
recently.  It’s pretty slick, in my opinion, and will become the default
skin in a week or two when a couple remaining issues are resolved.  For now,
you can try it out by setting the General Preferences / Bugzilla’s general
appearance (skin) option to Mozilla.  Of course, after it is made the default,
you can switch back to the old default (Dusk) if you prefer.</p>
<p>We have some more awesome changes landing in the next few weeks; I’ll post
another summary then.</p>" nil nil "dfd295a3a2fa676944087b384ec8bdfc") (591 (21005 56677 218833) "http://www.mihneadb.net/post/run-xpcshell-tests-in-parallel" "Planet Mozilla Interns: Mihnea Dobrescu-Balaur: Run XPCShell tests in parallel" nil "Thu, 15 Aug 2013 14:58:27 +0000" "<p>The patches in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=887054\">bug 887054</a>
(or as I like to call it, <em>parxpc</em>) have just landed!</p>
<p>For those who don't know what <em>XPCShell</em> is, think of it as a JavaScript
shell with XPConnect support, which basically means it can access all the
services and interfaces that you find in
<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Gecko\">Gecko</a>, among other
things. We use it for mostly all of our JavaScript tests that don't
require starting an actual browser instance, and we have quite a few
of those tests - on Linux, around 1700.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can now run all these tests in parallel, and
I found that if you have pretty fast storage (like an SSD), the gained
speedup is at least approximately equal to the number of (actual, not
hyperthreaded) cores in your computer.</p>
<p>For example, I went from this:</p>
<pre><code>./mach xpcshell-test --sequential  305.04s user 78.60s system 49% cpu 12:50.18 total
</code></pre>
<p>To this:</p>
<pre><code>./mach xpcshell-test  359.51s user 76.25s system 246% cpu 2:56.76 total
</code></pre>
<p>Even better, I've seen an almost two time speedup on
the Ubuntu test slaves that we have, which are <em>single</em> core.</p>
<p>You might be wondering what allowed us to get this enormous speedup, and
the answer (from what I found so far) is basically waiting on IO. Most
of the XPCShell based tests do tasks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>working with the filesystem</li>
<li>handling extensions and plugins</li>
<li>parsing static files</li>
<li>sending network requests</li>
</ul>
<p>Really few do CPU intensive tasks, like encoding and decoding some information.</p>
<p>You might be wondering what you have to do to benefit of this. It's easy! Just
update your working tree to the latest version of
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central\">mozilla-central</a> and the next time you
run the XPCShell tests with
<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/mach\">mach</a>,
they will run in parallel.</p>
<p>This change should not introduce any new test failures, so if you encounter any,
make sure it's not one of the known (filed) intermittents and please
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi\">file</a>
a bug about it. Don't forget to cc me (<em>:mihneadb</em>).</p>
<p>If you have trouble, there's the handy <em>--sequential</em> flag that you can pass to
mach in order to run tests one by one.</p>
<p>This is not yet enabled in automation because of some
intermittent failures that only happen some test slaves. I will get back with
a post with more details and some info on the whole process of parallelizing
the harness.</p>
<p>Feel free to post a comment with the speedup you got (<em>--sequential</em> makes it
easy to benchmark), I'm really curious!</p>" nil nil "def27220364cea18bf3abb2544fef7f9") (590 (21005 56677 218120) "http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/50/" "Nick Fitzgerald: Destructuring Assignment In Ecmascript 6" "Nick Fitzgerald" "Thu, 15 Aug 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "<h3>What is destructuring assignment?</h3>
<p>Destructuring assignment allows you to assign the properties of an array or
object to variables using syntax that looks similar to array or object
literals. This syntax can be extremely terse, while still exhibiting more
clarity than the traditional property access.</p>
<p>Without destructuring assignment, you might access the first three items in an
array like this:</p>
<pre><code>let first = someArray[0];
let second = someArray[1];
let third = someArray[2];
</code></pre>
<p>With destructuring assignment, the equivalent code becomes more concise and
read-able:</p>
<pre><code>let [first, second, third] = someArray;
</code></pre>
<p>TC39 (the governing committee of ECMAScript) has already reached consensus on
destructuring assignment and it is
<a href=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-11.13.3\">part of the draft ES6 specification</a>. Effectively what this means is that
it is now up to the people writing JavaScript engines to start implementing it;
SpiderMonkey (Firefox's JS engine) already has support for much of
it. <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=694100\">Track SpiderMonkey's destructuring (and general ES6) support in this bugzilla ticket</a>.</p>
<h3>Destructuring Arrays</h3>
<p>We already saw one example of destructuring assignment on an array above. The
general form of the syntax is:</p>
<pre><code>[ variable1, variable2, ..., variableN ] = array;
</code></pre>
<p>This will just assign variable1 through variableN to the corresponding item in
the array. If you want to declare your variables at the same time, you can add a
<code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, or <code>const</code> in front of the assignment:</p>
<pre><code>var [ variable1, variable2, ..., variableN ] = array;
let [ variable1, variable2, ..., variableN ] = array;
const [ variable1, variable2, ..., variableN ] = array;
</code></pre>
<p>Although <code>variable</code> is a misnomer since you can nest patterns as deep as you
would like:</p>
<pre><code>var [foo, [[bar], baz]] = [1, [[2], 3]];
console.log(foo);
// 1
console.log(bar);
// 2
console.log(baz);
// 3
</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, you can skip over items in the array being destructured:</p>
<pre><code>var [,,third] = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"];
console.log(third);
// \"baz\"
</code></pre>
<p>And you can capture all trailing items in an array with a \"rest\" pattern:</p>
<pre><code>var [head, ...tail] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(tail);
// [2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>When you access items in the array that are out of bounds or don't exist, you
get the same result you would by indexing: <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<pre><code>console.log([][0]);
// undefined
var [missing] = [];
console.log(missing);
// undefined
</code></pre>
<h3>Destructuring Objects</h3>
<p>Destructuring on objects lets you bind variables to different properties of an
object. You specify the property being bound, followed by the variable you are
binding its value to.</p>
<pre><code>var robotA = { name: \"Bender\" };
var robotB = { name: \"Flexo\" };
var { name: nameA } = robotA;
var { name: nameB } = robotB;
console.log(nameA);
// \"Bender\"
console.log(nameB);
// \"Flexo\"
</code></pre>
<p>There is a helpful syntactical shortcut for when the property and variable names
are the same:</p>
<pre><code>var { foo, bar } = { foo: \"lorem\", bar: \"ipsum\" };
console.log(foo);
// \"lorem\"
console.log(bar);
// \"ipsum\"
</code></pre>
<p>And just like destructuring on arrays, you can nest and combine further
destructuring:</p>
<pre><code>var complicatedObj = {
arrayProp: [
\"Zapp\",
{ second: \"Brannigan\" }
]
};
var { arrayProp: [first, { second }] } = complicatedObj;
console.log(first);
// \"Zapp\"
console.log(second);
// \"Brannigan\"
</code></pre>
<p>When you destructure on properties that are not defined, you get <code>undefined</code>:</p>
<pre><code>var { missing } = {};
console.log(missing);
// undefined
</code></pre>
<p>One potential gotcha you should be aware of is when you are using destructuring
on an object to assign variables, but not to declare them (when there is no
<code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, or <code>var</code>):</p>
<pre><code>{ blowUp } = { blowUp: 10 };
// Syntax error
</code></pre>
<p>This happens because the engine attempts to parse the expression as a block
statement (for example, <code>{ console }</code> is a valid block statement). The solution
is to either wrap the pattern or the whole expression in parenthesis:</p>
<pre><code>({ safe }) = {};
({ andSound } = {});
// No errors
</code></pre>
<h3>Destructuring Values that are not an Object or Array</h3>
<p>When you try to use destructuring on <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, you get a type
error:</p>
<pre><code>var [blowUp] = null;
// TypeError: null has no properties
</code></pre>
<p>However, you can destructure on other primitive types such as booleans, numbers,
and strings, and get <code>undefined</code>:</p>
<pre><code>var [wtf] = NaN;
console.log(wtf);
// undefined
</code></pre>
<p>This may come unexpected, but upon further examination it turns out to be
simple. When a value is being destructured, it is first
<a href=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-9.1.9\">converted to an object using the abstract operation <em>ToObject</em></a>. Most
types can be converted to an object, but <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> may not be.</p>
<h3>Default Values</h3>
<p>You can also provide default values for when the property you are destructuring
is not defined:</p>
<pre><code>var [missing = true] = [];
console.log(missing);
// true
var { x = 3 } = {};
console.log(x);
// 3
</code></pre>
<h3>Practical Applications of Destructuring</h3>
<h4>Function Parameter Definitions</h4>
<p>As developers, we can often expose nicer APIs by accepting a single object with
multiple properties as a parameter instead of forcing our API consumers to
remember the order of many individual parameters. We can use destructuring to
avoid repeating this single parameter object whenever we want to reference one
of its properties:</p>
<pre><code>function removeBreakpoint({ url, line, column }) {
// ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is a real world snippet of code from Firefox's debugger. We use this all
over the place, it is crazy nice.</p>
<h4>Configuration Object Parameters</h4>
<p>Expanding on the previous example, we can also give default values to the
properties of the objects we are destructuring. This is particularly helpful
when we have an object that is meant to provide configuration and many of the
object's properties already have sensible defaults. For example, jQuery's <code>ajax</code>
function takes a configuration object as its second parameter, and could be
re-written like this:</p>
<pre><code>jQuery.ajax = function (url, {
async = true,
beforeSend = function () {},
cache = true,
complete = function () {},
crossDomain = false,
global = true,
// ... more config
}) {
// ... do stuff
};
</code></pre>
<p>This avoids repeating <code>var foo = config.foo || 'default foo';</code> for each property of
the configuration object.</p>
<h4>With the ES6 Iteration Protocol</h4>
<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators\">ECMAScript 6 also defines an iteration protocol</a> somewhat similar to
the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0234/\">one in Python</a>. When you iterate over
<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map\"><code>Map</code>s (an ES6 addition to the standard library)</a>, you get a series of
<code>[key, value]</code> pairs. We can destructure this pair to get easy access to both
the key and the value:</p>
<pre><code>var map = new Map();
map.set(window, \"the global\");
map.set(document, \"the document\");
for (let [key, value] of map) {
console.log(key + \" is \" + value);
}
// \"[object Window] is the global\"
// \"[object HTMLDocument] is the document\"
</code></pre>
<p>Iterate over only the keys:</p>
<pre><code>for (let [key] of map) {
// ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or iterate over only the values:</p>
<pre><code>for (let [,value] of map) {
// ...
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Multiple Return Values</h4>
<p><a href=\"http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/36/\">I've written about this once before</a>. Returning multiple
values from a function is a lot more practical when you can destructure the
result:</p>
<pre><code>function returnMultipleValues() {
return [1, 2];
}
var [foo, bar] = returnMultipleValues();
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can use an object as the container and name the returned
values:</p>
<pre><code>function returnMultipleValues() {
return {
foo: 1,
bar: 2
};
}
var { foo, bar } = returnMultipleValues();
</code></pre>
<p>These both end up much better than holding onto the temporary container:</p>
<pre><code>function returnMultipleValues() {
return {
foo: 1,
bar: 2
};
}
var temp = returnMultipleValues();
var foo = temp.foo;
var bar = temp.bar;
</code></pre>
<h4>Importing a Subset of a Module</h4>
<p>When importing some module X into your own module Y, it is fairly common that
module X exports more functions than you are using. With destructuring, you can
be explicit about which parts of module X are being used in module Y:</p>
<pre><code>const { SourceMapConsumer, SourceNode } = require(\"source-map\");

<p>I attended an overview of how the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/servo\">Servo</a> browser engine, written in the <a href=\"http://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust programming language</a>, implements the task of laying out of elements on a web page. <a href=\"http://pcwalton.github.io/\">Patrick Walton</a> gave the talk and highlighted some of the implementation idioms in Servo. <a href=\"http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Phantom_type\">Phantom Types</a> are used in a number of places so I thought I’d try some phantom type examples to help learn more about Rust and Servo.</p>
<h3>DSL type checking</h3>
<p>Rust supports <a href=\"http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html#generics\">generics</a>. A phantom type is a type parameter that isn’t used in the definition of the type. Imagine a datatype that is used to represent types in a simple DSL:</p>
<pre><code>enum T  { TI(int), TS(~str) }</code></pre>
<p>The type <code>T</code> has two constructors. A <code>TI</code> representing an integer and a <code>TS</code> representing a string. In Rust the <code>~</code> prefixing <code>str</code> means ‘owned pointer to a string allocated on the heap’.</p>
<p>We have two functions that operate on this type. One to add two integers and the other to concatenate two strings:</p>
<pre><code>fn plus (lhs: T, rhs: T) -> T
fn concat (lhs: T, rhs: T) -> T </code></pre>
<p>Using these functions looks like:</p>
<pre><code>let d1 = TI(1);
let d2 = TI(2);
let x = plus(d1, d2);
display(&x);
let d1 = TS(~\"Hello, \");
let d2 = TS(~\"World\");
let y = concat (d1,d2);
display(&y);</code></pre>
<p>Unforunately with the type definition of <code>T</code> it is possible to add an integer and a string:</p>
<pre><code>let d1 = TI(1);
let d2 = TS(~\"Hello, \");
let x = plus(d1, d2);
display(&x);</code></pre>
<p>This won’t be caught at compile time but, assuming the <code>plus</code> function aborts on incorrect types, will fail at runtime. A full example that demonstrates this available in <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/test1.rs\">test1.rs</a>. Compiling with <code>rustc test.rs</code> and running the resulting <code>test</code> produces:</p>
<pre><code>int: 3
str: Hello, World
task <unnamed> failed at 'error', test1.rs:12</code></pre>
<p>We can detect this issue at compile time by using phantom types. This involves changing the <code>T</code> type to be:</p>
<pre><code>enum T<A>  { TI(int), TS(~str) }</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the type index <code>A</code> does not appear anywhere in the type definition on the right hand side. The definitions of <code>plus</code> and <code>concat</code> are changed to have a different type for the type index <code>A</code>:</p>
<pre><code>fn plus (lhs: T<int>, rhs: T<int>) -> T<int>
fn concat (lhs: T<~str>, rhs: T<~str>) -> T<~str></code></pre>
<p>We also have to change the code that creates the <code>TI</code> and <code>TS</code> types. Code like the following will successfully typecheck:</p>
<pre><code>let d1 = TI(1);
let d2 = TS(~\"hello\");
let x = plus(d1, d2);</code></pre>
<p>This is because <code>d1</code> and <code>d2</code> get their types inferred as <code>T<int></code> due to <code>plus</code> requiring two <code>T<int></code> types. What’s needed is to constrain the types of <code>d1</code> and <code>d2</code> to <code>T<int></code> and <code>T<~str></code> at the point of definition. This can be done with:</p>
<pre><code>let d1: T<int> = TI(1);
let d2: T<~str> = TS(~\"foo\");
let x = plus(d1, d2);</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately this will still work:</p>
<pre><code>let d1: T<int> = TI(1);
let d2: T<int> = TS(~\"foo\");
let x = plus(d1, d2);</code></pre>
<p>A better approach is to not use the constructors for the <code>T<A></code> enum and instead create our own:</p>
<pre><code>fn make_int (i: int)  -> T<int>  { TI(i) }
fn make_str (s: ~str) -> T<~str> { TS(s) }</code></pre>
<p>Using these to create our values will ensure that they have the type of the argument passed to the function. Passing the wrong type is now an error:</p>
<pre><code>let d1 = make_int(1);
let d2 = make_str(~\"foo\");
let x = plus(d1, d2);</code></pre>
<p>In real code it’s best to ensure that the constructors for <code>T<A></code> aren’t public to ensure that callers from outside the module can’t create them and subvert our attempts at better type checking.</p>
<p>This code also ensures that the result of a <code>plus</code> cannot be used in a <code>concat</code> and vice versa. The following code produces a compile error:</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
let d1 = TI(1);
let d2 = TI(2);
let x = plus(d1, d2);
display(&x);
let d1 = TS(~\"Hello, \");
let d2 = TS(~\"World\");
let y = concat (d1,d2);
display(&y);
// Compile error here
let z = concat(x, y);
display(&z);
}</code></pre>
<p>The full example is in <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/test2.rs\">test2.rs</a> and compiling it results in:</p>
<pre><code>test2.rs:45:17: 45:18 error: mismatched types:
expected `T<~str>` but found `T<int>` (expected ~str but found int)
test2.rs:45   let z = concat(x, y);
^</code></pre>
<p>Commenting out the offending code allows the program to compile and run without errors. There is no runtime overhead or additional code generated when using phantom types. The types are erased at compile time and the resulting program is as if they hadn’t been used at all - except that you know the code won’t have the runtime failure as it passed type checking.</p>
<h3>Safer strings</h3>
<p>Another use of phantom types is for providing a taint to string types so they can’t be used in an unsafe manner. An example of this is generating HTML template pages as the response to an HTTP request. The page is generated by concatenating various strings together. A string that comes from user input must be properly escaped before it is allowed to be embedded in an HTML page.</p>
<p>In this example we have a type representing an HTML fragment used to compose an HTML page to be generated:</p>
<pre><code>enum Fragment { Str(~str) }</code></pre>
<p>It only has one constructor, <code>Str</code>, which holds the unique string containing the page data. A <code>render_page</code> function displays a complete page:</p>
<pre><code>fn get_str(s: Fragment) -> ~str {
match s {
Str(s) => { s }
}
}
fn render_page(s: Fragment) {
println(get_str(s));
}</code></pre>
<p>Functions exist to generate the head and body of the page with the latter including some form of data obtained elsewhere. Perhaps user input or the output of some other process:</p>
<pre><code>fn get_head() -> Fragment {
Str(~\"<head></head>\")
}
fn get_body(s: Fragment) -> Fragment {
Str(\"<body>\" + get_str(s) + \"</body>\")
}</code></pre>
<p>Data from untrusted sources needs to be ‘blessed’. This should perform any escaping necessary to make the data safe to embed in the web page. The following is a <code>main</code> program that generates and displays the page:</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
let user_input = get_user_input(~\"<script>alert('oops')</script>\");
let page = generate_page(get_head(),
get_body(user_input));
render_page(page);
}</code></pre>
<p>This compiles and runs. The full example for trying it out is in <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/test3.rs\">test3.rs</a>. The output is:</p>
<pre><code><html><head></head><body><script>alert('oops')</script></body></html>  </code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately we forgot to call <code>bless</code> and the user input was added unescaped. Ideally this should be a compile time error. If we add a phantom type to the <code>Fragment</code> class we can differentiate between safe and unsafe strings with no runtime overhead:</p>
<pre><code>struct Safe;
struct Unsafe;
enum Fragment<T> { Str(~str) }</code></pre>
<p>All the generation functions now require safe fragments:</p>
<pre><code>fn generate_page(head: Fragment<Safe>, body: Fragment<Safe>) -> Fragment<Safe>
fn get_head() -> Fragment<Safe>
fn get_body(s: Fragment<Safe>) -> Fragment<Safe>
fn render_page(s: Fragment<Safe>)
fn bless(s: Fragment<Unsafe>) -> Fragment<Safe></code></pre>
<p>The exception is the function that obtains untrusted data. It returns an unsafe fragment:</p>
<pre><code>fn get_user_input(s: ~str) -> Fragment<Unsafe></code></pre>
<p>Now the code that forgets to call bless (in <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/test4.rs\">test4.rs</a>) results in a compile error:</p>
<pre><code>test4.rs:41:36: 41:46 error: mismatched types: expected `Fragment<Safe>`
but found `Fragment<Unsafe>` (expected struct Safe but found struct Unsafe)
test4.rs:41                            get_body(user_input));
^~~~~~~~~~</code></pre>
<p>This approach can be used to help wherever untrusted data shouldn’t be mixed with trusted data. Constructing SQL queries and generating URL’s are other examples.</p>
<h3>Servo</h3>
<p>One of the uses of phantom types in Servo is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/servo/blob/master/src/components/script/dom/node.rs#L63\">Node</a> type:</p>
<pre><code>// A phantom type representing the script task's view of this node. Script is able to mutate
/// nodes but may not access layout data.
pub struct ScriptView;
/// A phantom type representing the layout task's view of the node. Layout is not allowed to mutate
/// nodes but may access layout data.
pub struct LayoutView;
/// An HTML node.
///
/// `View` describes extra data associated with this node that this task has access to. For
/// the script task, this is the unit type `()`. For the layout task, this is
/// `layout::aux::LayoutData`.
pub struct Node<View> {
...
}</code></pre>
<p>A node has fields that should only be accessed or mutated on certain tasks. The script task can mutate nodes but cannot access data related to layout. The layout task is not allowed to mutate the node but can access the layout data. The prevents data races amongst the fields in the node.</p>
<p>The is implemented using phantom types. The node type is indexed over a <code>View</code> which can be <code>ScriptView</code> or <code>LayoutView</code>. There are methods implemented for <code>Node<ScriptView></code> which makes them only accessible to the script task:</p>
<pre><code>impl Node<ScriptView> {
pub fn ....
}</code></pre>
<p>An example of where the layout task gets the <code>LayoutView</code> version of a <code>node</code> is in <code>handle_reflow</code>. This takes a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/servo/blob/master/src/components/script/layout_interface.rs#L93\">Reflow</a> structure:</p>
<pre><code>pub struct Reflow {
/// The document node.
document_root: AbstractNode<ScriptView>,
/// The style changes that need to be done.
damage: DocumentDamage,
/// The goal of reflow: either to render to the screen or to flush layout info for script.
goal: ReflowGoal,
/// The URL of the page.
url: Url,
/// The channel through which messages can be sent back to the script task.
script_chan: ScriptChan,
/// The current window size.
window_size: Size2D<uint>,
/// The channel that we send a notification to.
script_join_chan: Chan<()>,
}</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>document_root</code> is an <code>AbstractNode<ScriptView></code>. Inside the <code>handle_reflow</code> function in the layout task it does:</p>
<pre><code>/// The high-level routine that performs layout tasks.
fn handle_reflow(&mut self, data: &Reflow) {
// FIXME: Isolate this transmutation into a \"bridge\" module.
let node: &AbstractNode<LayoutView> = unsafe {
transmute(&data.document_root)
};
...
}</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>transmute</code> is a cast. In this case it is converting the <code>AbstractNode<ScriptView></code> to an <code>AbstractNode<LayoutView></code>. The rest of the reflow deals with this so it can be proven to not access the script portions of the <code>node</code> and therefore should not have data races in those parts.</p>
<h3>Node simplified</h3>
<p>I’ve attempted to do a simplified example in Rust to test this type of phantom type usage. In <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/layout.rs\">layout.rs</a> I have a basic <code>Node</code> class that is indexed over the views:</p>
<pre><code>pub struct ScriptView;
pub struct LayoutView;
pub struct LayoutData {
field3: ~str,
}
impl LayoutData {
pub fn new() -> LayoutData {
LayoutData { field3: ~\"layoutdata\" }
}
}
pub struct Node<View> {
field1: ~str,
field2: ~str,
priv layout_data: Option<@mut LayoutData>
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>layout_data</code> is private. A method implemented on <code>Node<LayoutView></code> provides public access to it:</p>
<pre><code>impl Node<LayoutView> {
pub fn layout_data(&self) -> Option<@mut LayoutData> {
self.layout_data
}
}</code></pre>
<p>Only the layout task has the <code>LayoutView</code> of <code>Node</code> so only it can get access to the layout_data method. A <code>LayoutView</code> is obtained by casting (using <code>transmute</code>):</p>
<pre><code>impl<View> Node<View> {
pub fn change_view<View>(&self) -> &Node<View> {
unsafe {
transmute(self)
}
}
}</code></pre>
<p>The file <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/main.rc\">main.rc</a> contains the <code>main</code> function that tests these layout types and functions:</p>
<pre><code>mod layout;
pub fn main() {
use layout::*;
let a = ~Node::new();
std::io::println (a.field1);
std::io::println (a.field2);
let b: &Node<LayoutView> = a.change_view();
match (b.layout_data()) {
None => { std::io::println(\"no layout data\"); }
Some (data) => { std::io::println(data.field3); }
}
}</code></pre>
<p>This shows accessing the fields from the <code>ScriptView</code> view of the <code>Node</code> then switching to the <code>LayoutView</code> to get access to the <code>layout_data</code>. Trying to modify the non-layout fields with the <code>LayoutView</code> should fail. Build the example with <code>rustc main.rc</code> and make sure <code>main.rc</code> and <code>layout.rs</code> are in the current directory.</p>
<p>The Servo code is quite a bit more complex than this but hopefully it helps with understanding the idiom of phantom type usage in nodes. If I’ve made any mistakes in my understanding of how things work, please let me know!</p>

Since the project has proven itself both useful and stable, I’d like to share it with the world.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://connect-fonts.org\">Connect-fonts</a> makes it a snap for Connect/Express applications to self host web fonts.  By using connect-fonts, you are relieved from the difficult tasks of manually creating cross-browser font CSS and serving web font files with the correct headers. The middlware takes care of both.</p>
<p>In addition, connect-fonts makes enables you to serve minimal, locale specific font packs to your users. Why serve all Latin glyphs to all users if only the English, German (or your language) glyphs are needed? Serving fonts that contain only the glyphs needed for a user’s locale can result in <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/03/fantastic-front-end-performance-part-3-big-performance-wins-by-optimizing-fonts-a-node-js-holiday-season-part-8/\">huge performance gains</a> for your page’s load time.</p>
<h3>Why host your own fonts when Google (or Adobe, or FontSpring or somebody else) can do it for you?</h3>
<p>There are two primary reasons to host your own fonts: performance and privacy.</p>
<p>Even though Google’s font server is fast, it was freqently the slowest part of Persona’s load time. We saw significant performance increases after moving fonts onto our own servers.</p>
<p>Next, privacy. For many privacy sensitive applications, embedding 3rd party content is a non-starter and self-hosting all content is the only way to go.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Connect-fonts watches incoming traffic for specially formatted fonts.css requests. Upon match, a CSS response is generated and served to the user. The CSS contains @font-face declarations tailored to the user’s browser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/:font-list/fonts.css</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An optional locale can be specified to serve font files that contain only the glyphs needed for the user’s language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/:language/:font-list/fonts.css</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example route (with language specified) is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/en/opensans-regular,opensans-bold/fonts.css</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When requested, this results in CSS that looks like:</p>
<p></p><figure><p></p>
<pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">/* Generated by node-font-face-generator */

CSS served to Firefox for /en/opensans-regular,opensans-bold/fonts.css
<p></p></figure><p></p>
<p>When content is rendered, the browser first checks to see if the fonts are installed locally. If so, those fonts are used and no additional network requests are made. If the fonts are not available, the browser will fall back to requesting the remote fonts.</p>

principles that guided its design.  It's easy because in order to fully
appreciate them, one has to break away from the mindset of a developer (focused
on the API) or from the mindset of a localizer (focused on one specific
language).</p>
<p>One such principle is asymmetry.</p>
<p>L20n is asymmetric, which means that as long as the identifier stays the same,
the localizer is free to do whatever they feel is right and needed in
their language—without affecting any other language nor the source code.</p>
<p>Let this sink in for a moment.</p>
<p>L20n's asymmetry results in isolation of languages.  If Polish needs
declensions, they can use them, but it doesn't mean the developer have to
implement them for English too.  If French needs genders, they can have them,
but it doesn't mean that Basque will have to deal with gender-specific strings
in their translations.</p>
<h3>Choose what you need</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at an example to illustrate this point.  English:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><brandName</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefox\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
<span class=\"nv\"><about</span> <span class=\"s\">\"About {{ brandName }}\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>French:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><brandName</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefox\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
<span class=\"nv\"><about</span> <span class=\"s\">\"À propos de {{ brandName }}\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Polish:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><brandName</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">*nominative</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefox\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">locative</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefoksie\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
<span class=\"nv\"><about</span> <span class=\"s\">\"O {{ brandName.locative }}\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Polish localizer can choose (but in fact doesn't have to) to make the
translation better by using the grammatical case governed by the \"about\"
preposition (the locative).</p>
<p>Note that neither French nor English are affected.  Their translations stay as
simple as possible, because neither French nor English require such grammatical
construct.</p>
<p>When the developer asks for the value of the <code>about</code> entity, L20n will return
a single, grammatically-correct string: <em>About Firefox</em>, <em>À propos de Firefox</em>
and <em>O Firefoksie</em>, respectively.</p>
<p>All the localization logic is hidden from the developer and all that matters at
the end is a single string, ready to be used in the interface.</p>
<h3>Improve freely</h3>
<p>L20n's asymmetry is a powerful concept.  If languages are isolated, localizers
can tinker with the translations and progressively improve them.  They can
start simple, test, gather feedback from users, go back and change the <em>logic</em>
of the translation, without having to resort to filing bugs against the main
codebase.  All these improvement stay local to the localizer's language and
don't affect any other languages.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a simple example of a pluralized string in English.  You
can play with it yourself on <a href=\"http://bitly.com/16LfPfN\">L20n tinker</a>.</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$n</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>

<p>This is certainly good enough, but it could still be improved slightly.  You
might recall the following rule about writing numbers in English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spell out single-digit whole numbers. Use numerals for numbers greater than
nine. </p>

<p>The <code>digit</code> macro is local to the English localization file, so this
improvement is local.  Polish has less strict rules about numerals, so it might
not need an equivalent of the <code>digit</code> macro.  (It will need, however, more
plural forms.)</p>
<h3>Easy things are easy</h3>
<p>The motto of L20n that we live and code by is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Easy things are easy, complex things are possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of us—people living and breathing localization—are passionate about
linguistics and grammar, and it shows.  We like to look for hard-to-crack
grammatical problems and solve them in L20n.  (Check out Axel's educative
<a href=\"http://bitly.com/14CGbhc\">relative dates in Russian</a> example.)</p>
<p>This might sometimes looks scary if all you're looking for is a simple
key-value translation.  That's okay!  Languages in L20n are isolated, remember?
Even if Polish needs some funky logic to get its plural genders right, if <em>you</em>
don't need an entity to be complex, don't make it so!  L20n still has your
back.</p>" nil nil "3724da39a2eaee473acab2e8ed615efe") (586 (21005 56677 205717) "https://shanetomlinson.com/2013/persona-browserid-wordpress-plugin-45/" "Shane Tomlinson: v0.45 Release of the Persona WordPress Plugin" "Shane Tomlinson" "Tue, 13 Aug 2013 09:57:10 +0000" "<p>Today I released v0.45 of the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/browserid/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Persona WordPress Plugin\">Persona WordPress plugin</a>. A detailed list of changes are given below, but two improvements are worth highlighting. </p>
<h3>Improved Site Branding</h3>
<p>The Persona dialog can be customized with your site’s branding by specifying a site name, site logo, and now, <a href=\"http://identity.mozilla.com/post/55796551587/persona-a-login-that-matches-your-site\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Persona - A login that matches your site\">background color</a>. In addition, support for displaying your site’s terms of service and privacy policy have been added. Information on these options can be found on <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/navigator.id.request\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN docs for navigator.id.request\">MDN</a>.</p>

<h3>Elimination of comment spam</h3>
<p>With the “Enable for comments” option selected, the <a href=\"https://login.persona.org\" target=\"_blank\">Persona</a> plugin helps eliminate comment spam. A Persona account will be required to leave comments, a requirement that automated bots do not yet have. Until bot writers wisen up, Persona keeps spam at bay.</p>

<h3>Installation & Code</h3>
<p>The plugin can be found by searching for “Mozilla Persona” from the “Add New Plugin” page in the WordPress administration panel. Alternatively, it can be downloaded and manually installed from the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/browserid/\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla Persona</a> plugin page. Code is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/shane-tomlinson/browserid-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub.</a></p>

<ul>
<li><tt>--disable-debug-symbols</tt>: This option isn’t appropriate if you plan on doing <em>any </em>C/C++ debugging. Really. But if you work more-or-less exclusively in JavaScript (or Java, for Android), this option can make your builds go much faster by making your object files smaller and link times faster. My local Android builds shave 30 minutes of total runtime (!) by enabling this. The actual win is somewhere on the order of 3 minutes due to the wonders of parallel make. Still, 15% improvements are nothing to sneeze at.</li>
<li><tt>--disable-crashreporter</tt>: This configure option builds less code, which is always a good thing.  Needing the crashreporter would be pretty unusual for local development, so this is probably pretty safe.</li>
<li><tt>--disable-webrtc</tt>: Again, ths option is for not building a (somewhat larger) swath of code.  May not be appropriate if you’re doing Web Audio or trying to measure startup improvements.</li>
<li><tt>--disable-icf</tt>: This option is only useful if you’re building on Linux and you know you’re using the gold linker.  This option turns off merging of identical functions, which makes the linker run slightly faster.  (May also work on Windows with opt builds, not sure.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For development on Linux with GCC specifically, there are a few compiler options that may make your life better also:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>-fno-var-tracking</tt>: This option makes the debug information for C/C++ slightly less accurate.  Variable tracking is a relatively new thing (GCC 4.6+) and tends to suck up quite a bit of compile time.  If you were debugging happily with GCC 4.5 and earlier, you may not notice any problems with turning variable tracking off.</li>
<li><tt>-gsplit-dwarf</tt>: What this does is it separates debug information into a completely different file from the actual compiled code.  This change, in turn, makes the object files smaller, primarily for the benefit of the linker.  You can <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission\">read more about the motivation for splitting debug information</a> into separate files on the GCC Wiki.  There’s also <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=905646\">a bug about adding this by default to local developer builds</a>.  (Recent SVN builds of clang also support this option, I think.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you want to dive really deep, you can <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=901384\">play around with the options passed to the gold linker</a> on Linux.  (And if you do, please post some numbers to that bug; we’d love to get more data on how those options work for people!)</p>" nil nil "5be6969860d059ed578de518ea318bca") (582 (21004 62348 465821) "http://bookmaniac.org/supporting-the-ada-initiative-and-making-more-room/" "Liz Henry: Supporting The Ada Initiative, and making more room" "Liz Henry" "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 03:37:21 +0000" "<p>People ask me all the time what they can do to help change our culture.

<p>Earlier this summer I had an amazing experience at <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/events/\">AdaCamp </a> in San Francisco.

<p>The synergy from the feminist hackerspace discussions at AdaCamp SF led to the first meeting for a new feminist hacker and maker space in San Francisco. After a whole weekend of talking at AdaCamp, it was like we couldn’t stop!  I ended up with a dozen or so fierce activist women in my living room describing their vision for how we could make actual physical room for our projects and ourselves, a space we would invent, define, and maintain. It was really a dream come true.</p>
<p>As an long-time feminist activist, I have felt tremendous relief from the amount of peer support I’ve gained from working with The Ada Initiative. The people who are part of TAI have a tremendously sophisticated view of what we’re doing and why we’re doing it, and what we need to make it happen. I deeply appreciate the professional commitment of everyone at TAI and everyone I met at AdaCamp! That’s part of why I’m posting to ask you to donate.

<h3>DSL type checking</h3>
<p>Rust supports <a href=\"http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html#generics\">generics</a>. A phantom type is a type parameter that isn’t used in the definition of the type. Imagine a datatype that is used to represent types in a simple DSL:</p>
<pre><code>enum T  { TI(int), TS(~str) }</code></pre>
<p>The type <code>T</code> has two constructors. A <code>TI</code> representing an integer and a <code>TS</code> representing a string. In Rust the <code>~</code> prefixing <code>str</code> means ‘owned pointer to a string allocated on the heap’.</p>
<p>We have two functions that operate on this type. One to add two integers and the other to concatenate two strings:</p>
<pre><code>fn plus (lhs: T, rhs: T) -> T
fn concat (lhs: T, rhs: T) -> T </code></pre>
<p>Using these functions looks like:</p>
<pre><code>let d1 = TI(1);
let d2 = TI(2);
let x = plus(d1, d2);
display(&x);
let d1 = TS(~\"Hello, \");
let d2 = TS(~\"World\");
let y = concat (d1,d2);
display(&y);</code></pre>
<p>Unforunately with the type definition of <code>T</code> it is possible to add an integer and a string:</p>
<pre><code>let d1 = TI(1);
let d2 = TS(~\"Hello, \");
let x = plus(d1, d2);
display(&x);</code></pre>
<p>This won’t be caught at compile time but, assuming the <code>plus</code> function aborts on incorrect types, will fail at runtime. A full example that demonstrates this available in <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/test1.rs\">test1.rs</a>. Compiling with <code>rustc test.rs</code> and running the resulting <code>test</code> produces:</p>
<pre><code>int: 3
str: Hello, World
task <unnamed> failed at 'error', test1.rs:12</code></pre>
<p>We can detect this issue at compile time by using phantom types. This involves changing the <code>T</code> type to be:</p>
<pre><code>enum T<A>  { TI(int), TS(~str) }</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the type index <code>A</code> does not appear anywhere in the type definition on the right hand side. The definitions of <code>plus</code> and <code>concat</code> are changed to have a different type for the type index <code>A</code>:</p>
<pre><code>fn plus (lhs: T<int>, rhs: T<int>) -> T<int>
fn concat (lhs: T<~str>, rhs: T<~str>) -> T<~str></code></pre>
<p>This ensures that the result of a <code>plus</code> cannot be used in a <code>concat</code> and vice versa. The following code produces a compile error:</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
let d1 = TI(1);
let d2 = TI(2);
let x = plus(d1, d2);
display(&x);
let d1 = TS(~\"Hello, \");
let d2 = TS(~\"World\");
let y = concat (d1,d2);
display(&y);
// Compile error here
let z = concat(x, y);
display(&z);
}</code></pre>
<p>The full example is in <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/test2.rs\">test2.rs</a> and compiling it results in:</p>
<pre><code>test2.rs:45:17: 45:18 error: mismatched types:
expected `T<~str>` but found `T<int>` (expected ~str but found int)
test2.rs:45   let z = concat(x, y);
^</code></pre>
<p>Commenting out the offending code allows the program to compile and run without errors. There is no runtime overhead or additional code generated when using phantom types. The types are erased at compile time and the resulting program is as if they hadn’t been used at all - except that you know the code won’t have the runtime failure as it passed type checking.</p>
<h3>Safer strings</h3>
<p>Another use of phantom types is for providing a taint to string types so they can’t be used in an unsafe manner. An example of this is generating HTML template pages as the response to an HTTP request. The page is generated by concatenating various strings together. A string that comes from user input must be properly escaped before it is allowed to be embedded in an HTML page.</p>
<p>In this example we have a type representing an HTML fragment used to compose an HTML page to be generated:</p>
<pre><code>enum Fragment { Str(~str) }</code></pre>
<p>It only has one constructor, <code>Str</code>, which holds the unique string containing the page data. A <code>render_page</code> function displays a complete page:</p>
<pre><code>fn get_str(s: Fragment) -> ~str {
match s {
Str(s) => { s }
}
}
fn render_page(s: Fragment) {
println(get_str(s));
}</code></pre>
<p>Functions exist to generate the head and body of the page with the latter including some form of data obtained elsewhere. Perhaps user input or the output of some other process:</p>
<pre><code>fn get_head() -> Fragment {
Str(~\"<head></head>\")
}
fn get_body(s: Fragment) -> Fragment {
Str(\"<body>\" + get_str(s) + \"</body>\")
}</code></pre>
<p>Data from untrusted sources needs to be ‘blessed’. This should perform any escaping necessary to make the data safe to embed in the web page. The following is a <code>main</code> program that generates and displays the page:</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
let user_input = get_user_input(~\"<script>alert('oops')</script>\");
let page = generate_page(get_head(),
get_body(user_input));
render_page(page);
}</code></pre>
<p>This compiles and runs. The full example for trying it out is in <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/test3.rs\">test3.rs</a>. The output is:</p>
<pre><code><html><head></head><body><script>alert('oops')</script></body></html>  </code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately we forgot to call <code>bless</code> and the user input was added unescaped. Ideally this should be a compile time error. If we add a phantom type to the <code>Fragment</code> class we can differentiate between safe and unsafe strings with no runtime overhead:</p>
<pre><code>struct Safe;
struct Unsafe;
enum Fragment<T> { Str(~str) }</code></pre>
<p>All the generation functions now require safe fragments:</p>
<pre><code>fn generate_page(head: Fragment<Safe>, body: Fragment<Safe>) -> Fragment<Safe>
fn get_head() -> Fragment<Safe>
fn get_body(s: Fragment<Safe>) -> Fragment<Safe>
fn render_page(s: Fragment<Safe>)
fn bless(s: Fragment<Unsafe>) -> Fragment<Safe></code></pre>
<p>The exception is the function that obtains untrusted data. It returns an unsafe fragment:</p>
<pre><code>fn get_user_input(s: ~str) -> Fragment<Unsafe></code></pre>
<p>Now the code that forgets to call bless (in <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/test4.rs\">test4.rs</a>) results in a compile error:</p>
<pre><code>test4.rs:41:36: 41:46 error: mismatched types: expected `Fragment<Safe>`
but found `Fragment<Unsafe>` (expected struct Safe but found struct Unsafe)
test4.rs:41                            get_body(user_input));
^~~~~~~~~~</code></pre>
<p>This approach can be used to help wherever untrusted data shouldn’t be mixed with trusted data. Constructing SQL queries and generating URL’s are other examples.</p>
<h3>Servo</h3>
<p>One of the uses of phantom types in Servo is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/servo/blob/master/src/components/script/dom/node.rs#L63\">Node</a> type:</p>
<pre><code>// A phantom type representing the script task's view of this node. Script is able to mutate
/// nodes but may not access layout data.
pub struct ScriptView;
/// A phantom type representing the layout task's view of the node. Layout is not allowed to mutate
/// nodes but may access layout data.
pub struct LayoutView;
/// An HTML node.
///
/// `View` describes extra data associated with this node that this task has access to. For
/// the script task, this is the unit type `()`. For the layout task, this is
/// `layout::aux::LayoutData`.
pub struct Node<View> {
...
}</code></pre>
<p>A node has fields that should only be accessed or mutated on certain tasks. The script task can mutate nodes but cannot access data related to layout. The layout task is not allowed to mutate the node but can access the layout data. The prevents data races amongst the fields in the node.</p>
<p>The is implemented using phantom types. The node type is indexed over a <code>View</code> which can be <code>ScriptView</code> or <code>LayoutView</code>. There are methods implemented for <code>Node<ScriptView></code> which makes them only accessible to the script task:</p>
<pre><code>impl Node<ScriptView> {
pub fn ....
}</code></pre>
<p>An example of where the layout task gets the <code>LayoutView</code> version of a <code>node</code> is in <code>handle_reflow</code>. This takes a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/servo/blob/master/src/components/script/layout_interface.rs#L93\">Reflow</a> structure:</p>
<pre><code>pub struct Reflow {
/// The document node.
document_root: AbstractNode<ScriptView>,
/// The style changes that need to be done.
damage: DocumentDamage,
/// The goal of reflow: either to render to the screen or to flush layout info for script.
goal: ReflowGoal,
/// The URL of the page.
url: Url,
/// The channel through which messages can be sent back to the script task.
script_chan: ScriptChan,
/// The current window size.
window_size: Size2D<uint>,
/// The channel that we send a notification to.
script_join_chan: Chan<()>,
}</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>document_root</code> is an <code>AbstractNode<ScriptView></code>. Inside the <code>handle_reflow</code> function in the layout task it does:</p>
<pre><code>/// The high-level routine that performs layout tasks.
fn handle_reflow(&mut self, data: &Reflow) {
// FIXME: Isolate this transmutation into a \"bridge\" module.
let node: &AbstractNode<LayoutView> = unsafe {
transmute(&data.document_root)
};
...
}</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>transmute</code> is a cast. In this case it is converting the <code>AbstractNode<ScriptView></code> to an <code>AbstractNode<LayoutView></code>. The rest of the reflow deals with this so it can be proven to not access the script portions of the <code>node</code> and therefore should not have data races in those parts.</p>
<h3>Node simplified</h3>
<p>I’ve attempted to do a simplified example in Rust to test this type of phantom type usage. In <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/layout.rs\">layout.rs</a> I have a basic <code>Node</code> class that is indexed over the views:</p>
<pre><code>pub struct ScriptView;
pub struct LayoutView;
pub struct LayoutData {
field3: ~str,
}
impl LayoutData {
pub fn new() -> LayoutData {
LayoutData { field3: ~\"layoutdata\" }
}
}
pub struct Node<View> {
field1: ~str,
field2: ~str,
priv layout_data: Option<@mut LayoutData>
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>layout_data</code> is private. A method implemented on <code>Node<LayoutView></code> provides public access to it:</p>
<pre><code>impl Node<LayoutView> {
pub fn layout_data(&self) -> Option<@mut LayoutData> {
self.layout_data
}
}</code></pre>
<p>Only the layout task has the <code>LayoutView</code> of <code>Node</code> so only it can get access to the layout_data method. A <code>LayoutView</code> is obtained by casting (using <code>transmute</code>):</p>
<pre><code>impl<View> Node<View> {
pub fn change_view<View>(&self) -> &Node<View> {
unsafe {
transmute(self)
}
}
}</code></pre>
<p>The file <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/main.rc\">main.rc</a> contains the <code>main</code> function that tests these layout types and functions:</p>
<pre><code>mod layout;
pub fn main() {
use layout::*;
let a = ~Node::new();
std::io::println (a.field1);
std::io::println (a.field2);
let b: &Node<LayoutView> = a.change_view();
match (b.layout_data()) {
None => { std::io::println(\"no layout data\"); }
Some (data) => { std::io::println(data.field3); }
}
}</code></pre>
<p>This shows accessing the fields from the <code>ScriptView</code> view of the <code>Node</code> then switching to the <code>LayoutView</code> to get access to the <code>layout_data</code>. Trying to modify the non-layout fields with the <code>LayoutView</code> should fail. Build the example with <code>rustc main.rc</code> and make sure <code>main.rc</code> and <code>layout.rs</code> are in the current directory.</p>
<p>The Servo code is quite a bit more complex than this but hopefully it helps with understanding the idiom of phantom type usage in nodes. If I’ve made any mistakes in my understanding of how things work, please let me know!</p>

get_body(user_input));
render_page(page);
}</code></pre>
<p>This compiles and runs. The full example for trying it out is in <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/test3.rs\">test3.rs</a>. The output is:</p>
<pre><code><html><head></head><body><script>alert('oops')</script></body></html>  </code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately we forgot to call <code>bless</code> and the user input was added unescaped. Ideally this should be a compile time error. If we add a phantom type to the <code>Fragment</code> class we can differentiate between safe and unsafe strings with no runtime overhead:</p>
<pre><code>struct Safe;
struct Unsafe;
enum Fragment<T> { Str(~str) }</code></pre>
<p>All the generation functions now require safe fragments:</p>
<pre><code>fn generate_page(head: Fragment<Safe>, body: Fragment<Safe>) -> Fragment<Safe>
fn get_head() -> Fragment<Safe>
fn get_body(s: Fragment<Safe>) -> Fragment<Safe>
fn render_page(s: Fragment<Safe>)
fn bless(s: Fragment<Unsafe>) -> Fragment<Safe></code></pre>
<p>The exception is the function that obtains untrusted data. It returns an unsafe fragment:</p>
<pre><code>fn get_user_input(s: ~str) -> Fragment<Unsafe></code></pre>
<p>Now the code that forgets to call bless (in <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/test4.rs\">test4.rs</a>) results in a compile error:</p>
<pre><code>test4.rs:41:36: 41:46 error: mismatched types: expected `Fragment<Safe>`
but found `Fragment<Unsafe>` (expected struct Safe but found struct Unsafe)
test4.rs:41                            get_body(user_input));
^~~~~~~~~~</code></pre>
<p>This approach can be used to help wherever untrusted data shouldn’t be mixed with trusted data. Constructing SQL queries and generating URL’s are other examples.</p>
<h3>Servo</h3>
<p>One of the uses of phantom types in Servo is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/servo/blob/master/src/components/script/dom/node.rs#L63\">Node</a> type:</p>
<pre><code>// A phantom type representing the script task's view of this node. Script is able to mutate
/// nodes but may not access layout data.
pub struct ScriptView;
/// A phantom type representing the layout task's view of the node. Layout is not allowed to mutate
/// nodes but may access layout data.
pub struct LayoutView;
/// An HTML node.
///
/// `View` describes extra data associated with this node that this task has access to. For
/// the script task, this is the unit type `()`. For the layout task, this is
/// `layout::aux::LayoutData`.
pub struct Node<View> {
...
}</code></pre>
<p>A node has fields that should only be accessed or mutated on certain tasks. The script task can mutate nodes but cannot access data related to layout. The layout task is not allowed to mutate the node but can access the layout data. The prevents data races amongst the fields in the node.</p>
<p>The is implemented using phantom types. The node type is indexed over a <code>View</code> which can be <code>ScriptView</code> or <code>LayoutView</code>. There are methods implemented for <code>Node<ScriptView></code> which makes them only accessible to the script task:</p>
<pre><code>impl Node<ScriptView> {
pub fn ....
}</code></pre>
<p>An example of where the layout task gets the <code>LayoutView</code> version of a <code>node</code> is in <code>handle_reflow</code>. This takes a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/servo/blob/master/src/components/script/layout_interface.rs#L93\">Reflow</a> structure:</p>
<pre><code>pub struct Reflow {
/// The document node.
document_root: AbstractNode<ScriptView>,
/// The style changes that need to be done.
damage: DocumentDamage,
/// The goal of reflow: either to render to the screen or to flush layout info for script.
goal: ReflowGoal,
/// The URL of the page.
url: Url,
/// The channel through which messages can be sent back to the script task.
script_chan: ScriptChan,
/// The current window size.
window_size: Size2D<uint>,
/// The channel that we send a notification to.
script_join_chan: Chan<()>,
}</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>document_root</code> is an <code>AbstractNode<ScriptView></code>. Inside the <code>handle_reflow</code> function in the layout task it does:</p>
<pre><code>/// The high-level routine that performs layout tasks.
fn handle_reflow(&mut self, data: &Reflow) {
// FIXME: Isolate this transmutation into a \"bridge\" module.
let node: &AbstractNode<LayoutView> = unsafe {
transmute(&data.document_root)
};
...
}</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>transmute</code> is a cast. In this case it is converting the <code>AbstractNode<ScriptView></code> to an <code>AbstractNode<LayoutView></code>. The rest of the reflow deals with this so it can be proven to not access the script portions of the <code>node</code> and therefore should not have data races in those parts.</p>
<h3>Node simplified</h3>
<p>I’ve attempted to do a simplified example in Rust to test this type of phantom type usage. In <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/layout.rs\">layout.rs</a> I have a basic <code>Node</code> class that is indexed over the views:</p>
<pre><code>pub struct ScriptView;
pub struct LayoutView;
pub struct LayoutData {
field3: ~str,
}
impl LayoutData {
pub fn new() -> LayoutData {
LayoutData { field3: ~\"layoutdata\" }
}
}
pub struct Node<View> {
field1: ~str,
field2: ~str,
priv layout_data: Option<@mut LayoutData>
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>layout_data</code> is private. A method implemented on <code>Node<LayoutView></code> provides public access to it:</p>
<pre><code>impl Node<LayoutView> {
pub fn layout_data(&self) -> Option<@mut LayoutData> {
self.layout_data
}
}</code></pre>
<p>Only the layout task has the <code>LayoutView</code> of <code>Node</code> so only it can get access to the layout_data method. A <code>LayoutView</code> is obtained by casting (using <code>transmute</code>):</p>
<pre><code>impl<View> Node<View> {
pub fn change_view<View>(&self) -> &Node<View> {
unsafe {
transmute(self)
}
}
}</code></pre>
<p>The file <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/rust/pt/main.rc\">main.rc</a> contains the <code>main</code> function that tests these layout types and functions:</p>
<pre><code>mod layout;
pub fn main() {
use layout::*;
let a = ~Node::new();
std::io::println (a.field1);
std::io::println (a.field2);
let b: &Node<LayoutView> = a.change_view();
match (b.layout_data()) {
None => { std::io::println(\"no layout data\"); }
Some (data) => { std::io::println(data.field3); }
}
}</code></pre>
<p>This shows accessing the fields from the <code>ScriptView</code> view of the <code>Node</code> then switching to the <code>LayoutView</code> to get access to the <code>layout_data</code>. Trying to modify the non-layout fields with the <code>LayoutView</code> should fail. Build the example with <code>rustc main.rc</code> and make sure <code>main.rc</code> and <code>layout.rs</code> are in the current directory.</p>
<p>The Servo code is quite a bit more complex than this but hopefully it helps with understanding the idiom of phantom type usage in nodes. If I’ve made any mistakes in my understanding of how things work, please let me know!</p>

<p>I honestly do not feel Chromium will bring any better value to Ubuntu Users and I believe that more Ubuntu Users are using Firefox today then Chromium so switching the default will only be an inconvenience to most. As you are probably aware Firefox is actually in most recent benchmarks showing superior performance over other browsers.</p>
<p>So what next?</p>
<p>I urge Mozillians in the Ubuntu Community to <a href=\"http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-1308/\" target=\"_blank\">take part in the upcoming vUDS</a> and share your opinion on what the default browser should be in Ubuntu 14.04 and also feel free to <a href=\"https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-desktop\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe</a> to the Ubuntu Desktop mailing list and give your opinion there.</p>
<p>I think it is very important that Ubuntu continue to ship a browser which is backed by an organization like Mozilla which helps power the <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/\" target=\"_blank\">open web</a> and <a href=\"http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mayer-do-not-track/\" target=\"_blank\">champions user privacy</a>.</p>

principles that guided its design.  It's easy because in order to fully
appreciate them, one has to break away from the mindset of a developer (focused
on the API) or from the mindset of a localizer (focused on one specific
language).</p>
<p>One such principle is asymmetry.</p>
<p>L20n is asymmetric, which means that as long as the identifier stays the same,
the localizer is free to do whatever they feel is right and needed in
their language—without affecting any other language nor the source code.</p>
<p>Let this sink in for a moment.</p>
<p>L20n's asymmetry results in isolation of languages.  If Polish needs
declensions, they can use them, but it doesn't mean the developer have to
implement them for English too.  If French needs genders, they can have them,
but it doesn't mean that Basque will have to deal with gender-specific strings
in their translations.</p>
<h3>Choose what you need</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at an example to illustrate this point.  English:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><brandName</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefox\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
<span class=\"nv\"><about</span> <span class=\"s\">\"About {{ brandName }}\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>French:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><brandName</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefox\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
<span class=\"nv\"><about</span> <span class=\"s\">\"À propos de {{ brandName }}\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Polish:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><brandName</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">*nominative</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefox\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">locative</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefoksie\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
<span class=\"nv\"><about</span> <span class=\"s\">\"O {{ brandName.locative }}\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Polish localizer can choose (but in fact doesn't have to) to make the
translation better by using the grammatical case governed by the \"about\"
preposition (the locative).</p>
<p>Note that neither French nor English are affected.  Their translations stay as
simple as possible, because neither French nor English require such grammatical
construct.</p>
<p>When the developer asks for the value of the <code>about</code> entity, L20n will return
a single, grammatically-correct string: <em>About Firefox</em>, <em>À propos de Firefox</em>
and <em>O Firefoksie</em>, respectively.</p>
<p>All the localization logic is hidden from the developer and all that matters at
the end is a single string, ready to be used in the interface.</p>
<h3>Improve freely</h3>
<p>L20n's asymmetry is a powerful concept.  If languages are isolated, localizers
can tinker with the translations and progressively improve them.  They can
start simple, test, gather feedback from users, go back and change the <em>logic</em>
of the translation, without having to resort to filing bugs against the main
codebase.  All these improvement stay local to the localizer's language and
don't affect any other languages.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a simple example of a pluralized string in English.  You
can play with it yourself on <a href=\"http://bitly.com/16LfPfN\">L20n tinker</a>.</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$n</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">$n</span> <span class=\"nb\">== </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"nv\">?</span> <span class=\"s\">\"one\"</span> <span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"other\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
<span class=\"nv\"><message</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$msg</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">one</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ $msg }} message\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">other</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ $msg }} messages\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is certainly good enough, but it could still be improved slightly.  You
might recall the following rule about writing numbers in English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spell out single-digit whole numbers. Use numerals for numbers greater than
nine. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's try to implement this in L20n (<a href=\"http://bitly.com/16Ldam9\">tinker</a>):</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$n</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>

<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>

<p>The <code>digit</code> macro is local to the English localization file, so this
improvement is local.  Polish has less strict rules about numerals, so it might
not need an equivalent of the <code>digit</code> macro.  (It will need, however, more
plural forms.)</p>
<h3>Easy things are easy</h3>
<p>The motto of L20n that we live and code by is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Easy things are easy, complex things are possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of us—people living and breathing localization—are passionate about
linguistics and grammar, and it shows.  We like to look for hard-to-crack
grammatical problems and solve them in L20n.  (Check out Axel's educative
<a href=\"http://bitly.com/16cgl7z\">relative dates in Russian</a> example.)</p>
<p>This might sometimes looks scary if all you're looking for is a simple
key-value translation.  That's okay!  Languages in L20n are isolated, remember?
Even if Polish needs some funky logic to get its plural genders right, if <em>you</em>
don't need an entity to be complex, don't make it so!  L20n still has your
back.</p>" nil nil "61ec85e70dcb1c69518d3b5c7e99f677") (572 (21004 31827 238030) "http://www.mihneadb.net/post/wikicheck" "Planet Mozilla Interns: Mihnea Dobrescu-Balaur: Wikicheck" nil "Tue, 13 Aug 2013 19:00:23 +0000" "<p>I was checking out Wikipedia's API and I thought \"why not make a

for both practicing and learning a new programming language. Let me tell you
why.</p>
<p>First, a list of features that it should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>pasting a file that is passed as an argument</li>
<li>pasting input that's piped into stdin</li>
<li>support for user credentials</li>
<li>persistent user credentials in a config file</li>
<li>support for anonymous posting</li>
<li>the ability to specify a language (for syntax highlighting)</li>
<li>error handling (nothing too advanced)</li>
<li>saving the new paste URL in the user's clipboard</li>
</ul>
<p>The good thing about implementing all the above mentioned features is that you
end up dealing with many essential aspects that one usually encounters when
solving real tasks. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>stdin handling</li>
<li>file operations</li>
<li>JSON/INI parsing (config file, response from pastebin server)</li>
<li>HTTP requests</li>
<li>creating a process and passing it input (for clipboard handling)</li>
<li>command line arguments handling</li>
<li>string / file path manipulation</li>
<li>exceptions (invalid config file, bad HTTP request)</li>
<li>understanding and using an external API</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a nice exercise because it will not take too many lines of code (under
200, probably) and it will not eat up too much of your time either. If you want
to try it out, I recommend the <a href=\"https://www.refheap.com\">Refheap</a> pastebin
server because of their nice API and support for multiple languages - it even
supports <a href=\"http://www.rust-lang.org\">Rust</a>!</p>
<p>An extra challenge in case you opt for the Refheap API - they have a feature
that allows you to specify a file extension for the language attribute and they
will infer the correct syntax highlighting settings for you.</p>

<p>In Part 1 I want to recap where we started from and where we are today. In <a href=\"http://mrz.velvet.org/2013/08/14/rebooting-community-it-part-2/\" title=\"Rebooting Community IT, Part 2\">Part 2 </a>I’ll talk about <i>What’s Next</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/mrz/2011/10/06/my-job-after-5-558-years/\">October 2011</a> I asked the following question:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>“How can Mozilla IT impact the Mozilla Community?”</i></p>
<p>Within Mozilla IT I helped focus our efforts around three pillars:</p>
<ol>
<li>Community IT</li>
<li>Community/Volunteer Sysadmins</li>
<li>Air Mozilla</li>
</ol>
<p>I was even so bold to call out three specific goals for the end of 2012:</p>
<ol>
<li>to have 5-10 volunteer Community Sysadmins actively helping run Mozilla’s network and servers.</li>
<li>to have a vibrant Community IT group…</li>
<li>to have a premiere source for open source video technology, a site where the Mozilla Community can find, share and create video content</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel that I generally failed. Or rather, I did not meet the goals I set out.</p>
<p>But I’ve talked about <a href=\"http://mrz.velvet.org/2013/03/28/failure/\">failure before</a> and the Mozilla IT I left is not the same that it was in 2011. In fact, on behalf of my former team, I’ll claim the following two successes:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=\"https://air.mozilla.org/\"> Air Mozilla</a>.
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In 2011 this wasn’t a thing. No one cared about it.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Nearly a year later we were discussing specific policies on what we’d stream (public? internal?). A year later it was assumed everything we did would be streamed.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Air Mozilla became one of the primary communication tools at Mozilla.</p>
</li>
<li>Created infrastructure for <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/MCS:Hosting\">Community Website/Email Hosting</a>.
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Through Mozilla Reps, Mozilla IT worked to provide Email hosting for 13 communities and Website hosting for more than 29 hosted sites.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially, Mozilla IT literally <strong>empowered</strong> the Mozilla Community to promote the Mozilla Mission.</p>

<p>Ironically, that was the over arching goal I called out in the third paragraph <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/mrz/2011/10/06/my-job-after-5-558-years/\">October 2011</a>.</p>

Each and every item in the list has equal priority. Even if the sort order changes to show difference in priority, the physical appearance of the individual views are still the same. Think of browsing through 100+ bookmarks. Clearly a user would navigate to only 5-10 bookmarks often. Isn’t there a better way to showcase these top bookmarks? How about featuring the top friends that you talk to in a chat application, among 200+ contacts? The new design concept emerging these days to mitigate this issue has a grid of featured items with a big list following it.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://sriramramani.wordpress.com/2013/08/14/grid-in-a-listview/grid-in-a-list-view/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-320\"><img alt=\"Grid in a ListView\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-320\" height=\"666\" src=\"http://sriramramani.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/grid-in-a-list-view.jpg?w=791&h=666\" width=\"791\" /></a></p>
<p>How do we implement this in Android? If the number of entries is fixed, we could use a <code>LinearLayout</code> for the grid. The <code>ListView</code> could follow it. However if they both have different parents, the scrolling is a major issue, as <code>ListView</code> has its own scrolling. The alternative approach would be add the <code>LinearLayout</code> as a header to the <code>ListView</code>. This way, the grid of entries would scroll with the list. But usually, though the number of entries is fixed, the entries themselves aren’t fixed. They are shown as a result of a DB query or from a data set returned by the server. In such a case, <code>GridView</code> would be better as it is backed by an adapter. The problem here is that, both <code>GridView</code> and <code>ListView</code> are scrollable themselves, and it is not a good approach to embed a scrollable container inside another scrollable container. How do we make one of the views — the GridView, actually — “unscrollable”?</p>
<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\">    @Override
public int getColumnWidth() {
// This method will be called from onMeasure() too.
// It's better to use getMeasuredWidth(), as it is safe in this case.
final int totalHorizontalSpacing = mNumColumns > 0 ? (mNumColumns - 1) * mHorizontalSpacing : 0;
return (getMeasuredWidth() - getPaddingLeft() - getPaddingRight() - totalHorizontalSpacing) / mNumColumns;
}
@Override
protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
// Sets the padding for this view.
super.onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec);
final int measuredWidth = getMeasuredWidth();
final int childWidth = getColumnWidth();
int childHeight = 0;
// If there's an adapter, use it to calculate the height of this view.
final ListAdapter adapter = getAdapter();
final int count;
// There shouldn't be any inherent size (due to padding) if there are no child views.
if (adapter == null || (count = adapter.getCount()) == 0) {
setMeasuredDimension(0, 0);
return;
}
// Get the first child from the adapter.
final View child = adapter.getView(0, null, this);
if (child != null) {
// Set a default LayoutParams on the child, if it doesn't have one on its own.
AbsListView.LayoutParams params = (AbsListView.LayoutParams) child.getLayoutParams();
if (params == null) {
params = new AbsListView.LayoutParams(AbsListView.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT,
AbsListView.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
child.setLayoutParams(params);
}
// Measure the exact width of the child, and the height based on the width.
// Note: the child takes care of calculating its height.
int childWidthSpec = MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(childWidth, MeasureSpec.EXACTLY);
int childHeightSpec = MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(0,  MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED);
child.measure(childWidthSpec, childHeightSpec);
childHeight = child.getMeasuredHeight();
}
// Number of rows required to 'mTotal' items.
final int rows = (int) Math.ceil((double) mTotal / mNumColumns);
final int childrenHeight = childHeight * rows;
final int totalVerticalSpacing = rows > 0 ? (rows - 1) * mVerticalSpacing : 0;
// Total height of this view.
final int measuredHeight = childrenHeight + getPaddingTop() + getPaddingBottom() + totalVerticalSpacing;
setMeasuredDimension(measuredWidth, measuredHeight);
}
</pre>
<p>That’s it! We basically see if there is an adapter. If so, we ask the first child to measure itself, given some constraints. Based on the height of the first child, we calculate the number of rows required, and hence the total height of the view. This will be set as the measured dimension for the view. One thing to note here is that, the vertical spacing and the horizontal spacing aren’t available as getters in pre-ICS versions. It’s better to get them in the constructor and store them as class variables.</p>
<p>There is a weird case in Firefox for Android, that doesn’t allow the scroll from the GridView to be passed to the ListView. I couldn’t reproduce the actual scenario in a sample app. In case, you ever land in a similar scenario, here’s the recipe to solve it.</p>
<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\">    // In your ListView.

@Override
public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {
switch(event.getAction() & MotionEvent.ACTION_MASK) {
case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN: {
// Store the event by obtaining a copy.
// Android doesn't like storing the event as such.
mMotionEvent = MotionEvent.obtain(event);
break;
}
case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE: {
// If there is a move, make sure its more than the touch slop.
// The user's intention would have been to tap on the featured items.
if ((mMotionEvent != null) &&
(Math.abs(event.getY() - mMotionEvent.getY()) > mTouchSlop)) {
// The user is scrolling. Pass the last event to this view,
// and make this view scroll.
onTouchEvent(mMotionEvent);
// By returning true here, this ListView will receive
// all further touch events.
return true;
}
break;
}
default: {
mMotionEvent = null;
break;
}
}
// Do default interception.
return super.onInterceptTouchEvent(event);
}
</pre>
<p>That’s all folks! Show the most important contacts, top news articles, top photos as featured ones easily.</p>

<p>From 2011 to 2013, Mozilla IT’s impact on the Mozilla Community lead to <a href=\"https://air.mozilla.org/\" title=\"7 years @ Mozilla\">Air Mozilla</a> and <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/MCS:Hosting\">Community Website/Email Hosting</a>.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://signup.communitysysadmins.org/\"><img alt=\"CSAimage\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1295\" src=\"http://mzeier.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/csaimage.jpg?w=585\" /></a>The holy grail was something more. Something where volunteer contributors were running or helping run websites and working <em>with</em> Mozilla IT Operations.</p>
<p>Something where there is a <em>“talented group of volunteer SysAdmins who want to devote some of their time to help the open source and open communities with non-profit organizations that work to create open source and a better, open Web.”</em></p>
<p><em>[I blatantly lifted that off <a href=\"http://signup.communitysysadmins.org/\">communitysysadmins.org</a> - an effort I started with a small cohort of people early in 2013.]</em></p>
<p><b><i>Mozilla & Community IT Operations</i></b><br />
There hasn’t ever been a Community IT Operations <i>anything</i> at Mozilla.</p>
<p>Throughout my tenure at Mozilla we’d occasionally spin up servers or services that would be managed by someone in the community. We’d even support whole projects that were related to Mozilla but largely independent projects (Camino & SeaMonkey, for instance).</p>
<p>But unfortunately this felt very ad-hoc. These where difficult to support within Mozilla IT Operations.</p>
<p><b><i>What’s Next?</i></b><br />
With my Mozilla <a href=\"https://reps.mozilla.org/u/mrz/\">contributor hat</a> on, I want to build a <strong>new movement</strong>.</p>
<p>I want to start with a focus on Mozilla and build a Community IT / SysAdmin / Operations movement.</p>
<p>And I know we can do it.</p>
<p>We will be fierce. No one will build into the Internet the kinds of things we want to build.</p>
<p><b>Community IT Operations Kick Off Meeting</b><br />
I want to invite you to join my movement and our kick off meeting. We’re still sorting out then <em>when</em> (scheduling is hard – check out this <a href=\"http://doodle.com/cvrp4sir4i9zdp96\">Doodle</a> to help me find a time).</p>
<p>In the mean time, think about how you’d answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What impact does this group want to have on the Mozilla project?</li>
<li>How do we become a force multiplier for Mozilla?</li>
<li>What are our 9-12 month goals and objectives?</li>
<li>How do we do it?</li>
<li>How do we work with Mozilla IT Operations as partners?</li>
</ul>
<p>Join <tt><a href=\"https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/communityit\">communityit@mozilla.org</a></tt> and watch <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/IT/Community\">https://wiki.mozilla.org/IT/Community</a> for updates.</p>
<p>Join me?</p>
<p><b><i>We will be fierce. No one will build into the Internet the kinds of things we want to build.</i></b></p>

Each and every item in the list has equal priority. Even if the sort order changes to show difference in priority, the physical appearance of the individual views are still the same. Think of browsing through 100+ bookmarks. Clearly a user would navigate to only 5-10 bookmarks often. Isn’t there a better way to showcase these top bookmarks? How about featuring the top friends that you talk to in a chat application, among 200+ contacts? The new design concept emerging these days to mitigate this issue has a grid of featured items with a big list following it.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://sriramramani.wordpress.com/2013/08/14/grid-in-a-listview/grid-in-a-list-view/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-320\"><img alt=\"Grid in a ListView\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-320\" height=\"666\" src=\"http://sriramramani.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/grid-in-a-list-view.jpg?w=791&h=666\" width=\"791\" /></a></p>
<p>How do we implement this in Android? If the number of entries is fixed, we could use a <code>LinearLayout</code> for the grid. The <code>ListView</code> could follow it. However if they both have different parents, the scrolling is a major issue, as <code>ListView</code> has its own scrolling. The alternative approach would be add the <code>LinearLayout</code> as a header to the <code>ListView</code>. This way, the grid of entries would scroll with the list. But usually, though the number of entries is fixed, the entries themselves aren’t fixed. They are shown as a result of a DB query or from a data set returned by the server. In such a case, <code>GridView</code> would be better as it is backed by an adapter. The problem here is that, both <code>GridView</code> and <code>ListView</code> are scrollable themselves, and it is not a good approach to embed a scrollable container inside another scrollable container. How do we make one of the views — the GridView, actually — “unscrollable”?</p>
<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\">    @Override
public int getColumnWidth() {
// This method will be called from onMeasure() too.
// It's better to use getMeasuredWidth(), as it is safe in this case.
final int totalHorizontalSpacing = mNumColumns > 0 ? (mNumColumns - 1) * mHorizontalSpacing : 0;
return (getMeasuredWidth() - getPaddingLeft() - getPaddingRight() - totalHorizontalSpacing) / mNumColumns;
}
@Override
protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
// Sets the padding for this view.
super.onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec);
final int measuredWidth = getMeasuredWidth();
final int childWidth = getColumnWidth();
int childHeight = 0;
// If there's an adapter, use it to calculate the height of this view.
final TopBookmarksAdapter adapter = (TopBookmarksAdapter) getAdapter();
final int count;
// There shouldn't be any inherent size (due to padding) if there are no child views.
if (adapter == null || (count = adapter.getCount()) == 0) {
setMeasuredDimension(0, 0);
return;
}
// Get the first child from the adapter.
final View child = adapter.getView(0, null, this);
if (child != null) {
// Set a default LayoutParams on the child, if it doesn't have one on its own.
AbsListView.LayoutParams params = (AbsListView.LayoutParams) child.getLayoutParams();
if (params == null) {
params = new AbsListView.LayoutParams(AbsListView.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT,
AbsListView.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
child.setLayoutParams(params);
}
// Measure the exact width of the child, and the height based on the width.
// Note: the child takes care of calculating its height.
int childWidthSpec = MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(childWidth, MeasureSpec.EXACTLY);
int childHeightSpec = MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(0,  MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED);
child.measure(childWidthSpec, childHeightSpec);
childHeight = child.getMeasuredHeight();
}
// Number of rows required to 'mTotal' items.
final int rows = (int) Math.ceil((double) mTotal / mNumColumns);
final int childrenHeight = childHeight * rows;
final int totalVerticalSpacing = rows > 0 ? (rows - 1) * mVerticalSpacing : 0;
// Total height of this view.
final int measuredHeight = childrenHeight + getPaddingTop() + getPaddingBottom() + totalVerticalSpacing;
setMeasuredDimension(measuredWidth, measuredHeight);
}
</pre>
<p>That’s it! We basically see if there is an adapter. If so, we ask the first child to measure itself, given some constraints. Based on the height of the first child, we calculate the number of rows required, and hence the total height of the view. This will be set as the measured dimension for the view. One thing to note here is that, the vertical spacing and the horizontal spacing aren’t available as getters in pre-ICS versions. It’s better to get them in the constructor and store them as class variables.</p>
<p>There is a weird case in Firefox for Android, that doesn’t allow the scroll from the GridView to be passed to the ListView. I couldn’t reproduce the actual scenario in a sample app. In case, you ever land in a similar scenario, here’s the recipe to solve it.</p>
<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\">    // In your ListView.

@Override
public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {
switch(event.getAction() & MotionEvent.ACTION_MASK) {
case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN: {
// Store the event by obtaining a copy.
// Android doesn't like storing the event as such.
mMotionEvent = MotionEvent.obtain(event);
break;
}
case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE: {
// If there is a move, make sure its more than the touch slop.
// The user's intention would have been to tap on the featured items.
if ((mMotionEvent != null) &&
(Math.abs(event.getY() - mMotionEvent.getY()) > mTouchSlop)) {
// The user is scrolling. Pass the last event to this view,
// and make this view scroll.
onTouchEvent(mMotionEvent);
// By returning true here, this ListView will receive
// all further touch events.
return true;
}
break;
}
default: {
mMotionEvent = null;
break;
}
}
// Do default interception.
return super.onInterceptTouchEvent(event);
}
</pre>

This should make it easier for people to file bugs in RelEng, improve triaging so bugs dont get lost, and help us scale. We think this is a big improvement, and hope you like it. </p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
The scope, and the nature, of Release Engineering has evolved significantly over the last 6 years. As our responsibilities grow, the group grows, and as we re-scope who works on what, our old components simply weren’t working well for us anymore. It was getting tricky to keep track of new incoming new bugs, it was unclear (and inconsistent) on where new bugs should be filed, existing bugs were getting lost in the noise and triage of all this was becoming unwieldy. We already did one big change of our components at the start of the year (2013), which helped a bunch, but which we felt could be improved further. Today, after lots of planning, these changes went live, with thanks to glob for his behind-the-scenes-bugzilla-magic. </p>
<p>These new components may not be perfect (!), but we believe this is a big improvement over what we had earlier this year, and which is, in turn an improvement over what we had before that! </p>
<p>Of course, renaming and creating new components doesn’t actually *<em>fix</em>*  bugs. But, this change should make it easier for people to file bugs in the right component, easier for RelEng to triage, and harder for bugs to fall through the cracks. </p>
<p>This reshuffle is already helping cleanup our backlog – we’ve already found bugs that were DUPs, as well as fixed-long-ago-yet-left-open bugs. Please do be patient with us while we triage our way through all our bugs, and if we update a long-sleeping bug of yours asking for more info, please do bear with us while we figure all these out. </p>
<p>Thanks<br />
John.<br />

ps: You can see more details in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=898244\">bug#898244</a>, but the summary is:</p>
<p>0) Saved searches that relied on the ID of the renamed components should be ok, but saved searches that relied on matching the component name will need to be updated.</p>
<p>1) The new name and scope for each component is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Release Engineering: Buildduty:</strong><br />
This component tracks the routine care and feeding of RelEng systems (machine management), reconfigs of masters, and any tree closures or<br />
downtimes. This includes physical machines in any of Mozilla’s colos, as well as instances in AWS.</p>
<p><strong>Release Engineering: Loan Requests:</strong><br />
This component tracks all requests from developers for a loan of a production machines.</p>
<p><strong>Release Engineering: General Automation:</strong><br />
This component tracks</p>
<ul>
<li>Modifying or removing existing builds, tests and other jobs</li>
<li>Adding support for new types of jobs, builds or tests (e.g. opt, pgo,<br />
debug, ASAN or code coverage builds; b2g device builds, new test suites;<br />
special builds like spidermonkey or valgrind)</li>
<li>Scheduler changes: what jobs get run and when</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Release Engineering: Release Automation:</strong><br />
This component tracks bugs related to the Release Automation including, but not limited to buildbot code.</p>
<p><strong>Release Engineering: Releases:</strong><br />
This component tracks bugs related to specific releases, or updates to those releases.</p>
<p><strong>Release Engineering: Tools:</strong><br />
This component tracks large scale tools used to interact with RelEng systems. Some examples include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>vcs2vcs, balrog, tryserver/trychooser, cloud-tools, buildapi,<br />
self-serve, hg/git mapper, integration-with-s3, tools-for-sheriffs,<br />
autoland, kittenherder…</li>
<li>alerts for colo outages, long-running-jobs,</li>
<li>reports for wait-times, try-server-top-users, cost reporting, slave health, …</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Release Engineering: Platform Support:</strong><br />
This component tracks requests for supporting builds/tests on a new operating system. (Examples include: android x86, win 8.1, osx10.9). This component also tracks requests for toolchain changes (new versions of compilers, python, hg, git, puppet, GPO, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Release Engineering: Repos and Hooks:</strong><br />
This component handles creating/deleting Mercurial and Git repos on hg.mozilla.org and git.mozilla.org respectively, any mirroring between those systems, as well as any hooks on those repos. Note: This used to be the unowned mozilla.org::HgCustomizations component, which has significant production impact, and overlapped with work we do for new repo requests, so made sense to include here.</p>
<p><strong>Release Engineering: Other: </strong><br />
This component is used for goals, tracking bugs, and any general RelEng work that spans across different RelEng components. Anything that doesn’t fit in any other component goes here.</p>

<p>Four days, four images and one idea that born in my brain some years ago take life because I love so much the graffiti street art from Bogotá, Mozilla and Firefox.</p>
<p>The Firefox OS launch in Colombia got me the opportunity to propose and to do this project, I chose <a href=\"http://wardesign.co\" target=\"_blank\">War Design</a> people because they are the best, and yes,  they are my friends.</p>
<p>From Mozilla, I worked with Nobox people (Mozilla’s outsourcing for marketing) and Chelsea (MoCo, marketing). is important to say that like in most of the projects, nothing is perfect but the important is that we have this amazing wall and we can learn from mistakes.</p>
<p>Special thanks to: Marcela, Oscar, Gloria and Jessica because working with you I do this real.</p>

I think the model for the <i>future</i> is \"web apps,\" by which I mean applications developed using HTML5, JavaScript, and the various APIs coming out of the W3C.<br /><br />An objection I've heard raised here -- actually, two different objections, but with the same root -- is (1) people don't want to open their web browser and surf to a web page to run their programs, and (2) the mobile web browsing experience is not terribly convenient.<br /><br />What's critical to realize is that \"web     apps\" aren't necessarily bound to the experience of \"opening up a web     browser as an explicit action, navigating to an application's web     site, and then interacting with it as if it were a web page.\"     Web-apps-as-first-class-apps is a viable model for development and deployment. And there is a team of people inside Mozilla who are working really hard to make this work as seamlessly as possible.<br /><br />Both FirefoxOS and BlackBerry 10 <i>inherently</i> treat     HTML5/JavaScript applications as \"first class\" apps. In FirefoxOS,     it's the sole means of developing applications; and BlackBerry 10     uses it as one of <a href=\"http://developer.blackberry.com/develop/platform_choice/index.html\">several native development    environments</a>. In both cases, the user's experience is     indistinguishable from what they're used to apps doing: there isn't     even an intermediating browser anywhere in the mix. The HTML5 and     JavaScript engines are an inbuilt part of both operating systems. <br /><br />I recognize that neither platform has the penetration to be a real game changer; at least, not at the moment. I'm holding them up as existence proofs     that the approach of \"web app as native app\" is viable. But let's     talk about how these technologies can be leveraged for native webapp deployment on Android, iOS, and Desktop systems.<br /><br />All of these systems have their own idea of \"installed applications.\"     To be successful, we need some way to make these     HTML5/JavaScript applications look, act, and feel like every other     kind of application (rather than \"something running in a web browser\").<br /><br />This is where the work that Mozilla has been doing for web app deployment comes into play, and it's easier to demonstrate than it is to explain. If you have Firefox installed on your desktop (or     Firefox Aurora on your Android device), you can go to     <a class=\"moz-txt-link-freetext\" href=\"https://marketplace.firefox.com/\">https://marketplace.firefox.com/</a>, find apps that amuse you, and     click on \"install.\" At that point, Firefox takes the steps necessary     to put an icon in whatever location you're used to finding your     applications. On your Android device, you get an application icon. Under OS X, you get a new application in Launchpad. For Windows, you get... well, whatever your version of Windows uses to access installed apps.<br /><br />From that point forward, the distinction between these web apps     and native applications is impossible for users to discern.<br /><br />Interestingly, iOS was both a bit of a pioneer in this space, and     also remains the most frustrating platform in this regard. If you     recall Apple's stance when the original iPhone first launched, they     didn't allow third-party applications at all. Instead, their story     was that HTML and JavaScript were powerful enough to develop     whatever applications people want to write. Presumably as part of     this legacy, iOS still allows users to manually save \"bookmarks\" to     their desktop. If the content behind those bookmarks is iOS-aware,     then the bookmarks open in a way that hides the browser controls --     effectively acting like a native app. If you have an iOS device, you     can play around with how compelling this experience can be by going     to <a class=\"moz-txt-link-freetext\" href=\"http://slashdot.org/\">http://slashdot.org/</a> -- select the box-and-arrow icon at the     bottom of your browser, and click \"Add to Home Screen.\" Now,     whenever you open the newly-created icon, it acts and feels exactly     like you downloaded and installed a native \"Slashdot\" application     onto your device. It even appears in the task management bar as a     separate application.<br /><br />The reason the iOS experience remains frustrating is twofold. First,     and primarily an annoyance to developers: the only HTML5/JavaScript     rendering engine allowed on the platform is Apple's own webkit     implementation. This frustrates the ability to add new APIs, such as     may be required for new applications. So, new APIs are only added at     whatever pace Apple's product plan gets them added. Secondly -- and     of actual concern to users -- there is no programmatic way to add     web app icons to the desktop. Creating these icons requires a     relatively arcane series of user steps (described above). Basically,     Apple is playing the role of the napping hare in this     tortoise-and-hare race: they were very fast out the gate, but have     been asleep for quite a while now.<br /><br />But that covers all the bases: it's possible to develop HTML5/JavaScript apps that truly run     cross-platform for iOS, Android, Blackberry, FirefoxOS, and a variety of desktop systems     -- even if the Apple experience is somewhat less than satisfying     (for both developers and users).<br /><br />I suspect most of what's holding developers back is predominantly a     lack of knowledge that this is a viable technical model. I've heard developer feedback that one major reason they aren't targeting JavaScript environments involve concerns about     the speed of execution in a JavaScript environment. It's not yet clear whether these problems are merely perception or reality.  I've seen some impressive     things like <a href=\"http://polycrypt.net/\">usable cryptography</a>, <a href=\"https://brendaneich.com/2013/05/today-i-saw-the-future/\">high-def video codec decoding</a>, <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">and high-performance first-person 3D environments</a> (including <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/bananabread\">    viable multiplayer first-person shooters</a>) implemented in pure JavaScript, so I suspect it's more a perception problem based on very outdated experiences. I'd love feedback from anyone who has run into performance problems trying to use this model with a modern JavaScript interpreter.</div>" nil nil "e4729a1c4c554e58f04e97bbcc80c595") (553 (21002 21210 293167) "http://bookmaniac.org/supporting-the-ada-initiative-and-making-more-room/" "Liz Henry: Supporting The Ada Initiative, and making more room" "Liz Henry" "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 03:37:21 +0000" "<p>People ask me all the time what they can do to help change our culture.

The people who are part of TAI have a tremendously sophisticated view of what we’re doing and why we’re doing it, and what we need to make it happen. I deeply appreciate the professional commitment of everyone at TAI and everyone I met at AdaCamp! That’s part of why I’m posting to ask you to donate. It’s important to make support for women in free and open source tech and culture truly part of our infrastructure. We can do that by funding that work! Here’s some <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/faq/donation-help-and-faq/\">ways to donate</a>!</p>

<p>I don’t want to box you in, and anyhow it’s more of a continuum than a yes/no, but I see things I recognize. The way you play for an hour by yourself without any outside stimulation. The way you stand at the edge of a group of kids at the park, watching them and trying to figure them out. You come by it honestly, but it still makes my heart hurt a bit. Not because I disapprove; far from it. Introverts are some of my very favourite people, and also pretty in vogue among the techie, cerebral, introspective types I tend to run with. But introversion is tricky. You’ll pick up labels like “shy” and “awkward” and you’ll either take those in as parts of your identity or you’ll rebel against them. Or maybe you won’t. Maybe you’ll be a perfectly well-adjusted human. It is a <a href=\"http://blog.johnath.com/2013/02/13/3-years-old/\">pretty</a> <a href=\"http://blog.johnath.com/2012/08/13/two-and-a-half/\">consistent</a> <a href=\"http://blog.johnath.com/2012/02/13/2-years-old/\">folly</a> of your dad’s to extrapolate from today to your entire future life. It’s probably silly and I probably shouldn’t, but I do. And sometimes it makes my heart hurt.</p>
<p>Speaking of extrapolation, I’ve been thinking about who, what, and where you’ll be when you read these. I imagine you in your 20s. I don’t know why. I don’t know how I expect to keep them secret from you that long. But I think of you reading them in your 20s, all of them in a sitting, and I wonder what you’ll want to know about being three and a half. You like pears and corn on the cob and sausages with mustard. You love the beach. You’re in circus school on Sunday mornings. You find the word “toots” hilarious. Your youtube favourites are vihart’s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjrI91J6jOw\">math videos</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpccpglnNf0\">goats yelling like humans</a>.</p>
<p>That will change. You change quickly now. You went away to California for a few weeks to visit some friends and you came back a different kid. It made me feel protective for a minute. Like I didn’t want you influenced by the outside world. Which is stupid, because those influences are wonderful kids, but also because your life is going to be full of other influences and the last thing I would want to do is stop it. But parenthood is a conservative force – we love you the way you are, and we resist change that we didn’t initiate. Forgive me that, if it happens again when you’re old enough to notice. It’s not a rational response; it’s a reflex. Parental lizard brain.</p>
<p>The world will be different, too. Right now, we — the collective we — worry about some things. We worry about the planet – we think we’re heating it up and we think that’s going to cause big problems. We’re spending a frustrating lot of time debating the evidence and agreeing with each other, but we also have lots of excellent people trying to make it better. We worry about humanity – it’s getting easier for one angry person to hurt a lot of people, and the fear of that is pushing governments into reactions straight out of science fiction: armed drone patrols, global mass surveillance. I don’t talk about this much with the three and a half year old you, but I want the adult you to know that we see these things happening, and we’re not sure how to fix them, but we’ll try. I have hope that we’ll succeed.</p>
<p>Right now, that’s not your biggest concern, though. And that’s fine. Right now your biggest concerns are whether there is ice cream at the beach (there is), and whether tonight is a hair-washing night (it is), and whether I will read you one more story (I will). Thank you for adding so much silly to my life. Thank you for asking “why?” about everything. Thank you for sneaking quietly into the bedroom on Saturday morning, staring at me inches from my face until I startle awake, and then announcing that it’s time for pancakes.</p>
<p>I love you, Lil, and I love the person you’re becoming.</p>

It details how poorly TCP's packet loss recovery techniques map onto HTTP and proposes a few techniques (some more backwards compatible than others) for improving things. Its a large collaborative effort from Google and USC. Go read it.<br /><br />The most important piece of information is that TCP flows that experienced a loss took 5 times longer to complete than flows that did not experience a loss. 10% of flows fell into the \"some loss\" bucket. For good analysis go read the paper, but the shorthand headline is that this is because the short \"mice\" flows of HTTP/1 tend to be comprised mostly of tail packets and traditionally tail loss is only recovered using horrible timeout based strategies.<br /><br />This is the best summary of the problem that I've seen - but its been understood for quite a while. It is one of the motivators of HTTP/2 and is a theme underlying several of the blog posts google has made about QUIC.<br /><br />The \"aggression\" concept used in the paper is essentially the inclusion of redundant data in the TCP flow under some circumstances. This can, at the cost of extra bandwidth, bulk up mice flows so that their tail losses are more likely to be recovered with single RTT mechanisms such as SACK based fast recovery instead of timeouts. Conceivably this extra data could also be treated as an error correction coding which would allow some losses to be recovered independent of the RTT." nil nil "df60e6e5755221e660e5c2170014d8a9") (548 (21002 13224 598571) "http://bookmaniac.org/supporting-the-ada-initiative-and-making-more-room/" "Liz Henry: Supporting The Ada Initiative, and making more room" "Liz Henry" "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 03:37:21 +0000" "<p>People ask me all the time what they can do to help change our culture.

</ul>

</ul>
<p>There was work to improve the performance of CFI and EXIDX native unwinding, by improving performance of the data structures accessed by the CFI/EXIDX unwind algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>speedups for GetModuleForAddress — replaced a linear search with a binary search (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=892774\">892774</a>).</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>the unwinder spends considerable effort repeatedly re-generating unwind rules for the same relatively small set of code addresses.  Caching them makes a big difference (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=893542\">893542</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above fixes in place, native unwinding performance for x86_64-linux costs about 8100 instructions per frame, or around 145k instructions/unwind for an average 18-frame unwind.</p>
<p>There are still opportunities to remove inefficiency, but they are becoming scarcer.  It might be possible to get to about 5000 insns/frame without too much extra effort, but below that  could be difficult.</p>

I realy believe that it’s helping, and wil continue to help!</p>
<p>Personally I <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/donate/?\">donate monthly to The Ada Initiative</a> as well as participating on its <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/about-us/advisors/\">advisory board</a>. Over the past couple of years I’ve benefitted directly from The Ada Initiative as I see conference after conference put <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/conference-policies/\">anti-harassment policies into place</a>, which TAI has worked hard to facilitate.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer I had an amazing experience at <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/events/\">AdaCamp </a> in San Francisco. The Melbourne and DC AdaCamps bore fruit too, as they connected so many women in open tech and culture with the communities I’m already part of, and made us visible to each other. </p>
<p>The synergy from the feminist hackerspace discussions at AdaCamp SF led to the first meeting for a new feminist hacker and maker space in San Francisco. After a whole weekend of talking at AdaCamp, it was like we couldn’t stop!  I ended up with a dozen or so fierce activist women in my living room describing their vision for how we could make actual physical room for our projects and ourselves, a space we would invent, define, and maintain. It was really a dream come true.</p>
<p>As an long-time feminist activist, I have felt tremendous relief from the amount of peer support I’ve gained from working with The Ada Initiative.

I think the model for the <i>future</i> is \"web apps,\" by which I mean applications developed using HTML5, JavaScript, and the various APIs coming out of the W3C.<br /><br />An objection I've heard raised here -- actually, two different objections, but with the same root -- is (1) people don't want to open their web browser and surf to a web page to run their programs, and (2) the mobile web browsing experience is not terribly convenient.<br /><br />What's critical to realize is that \"web     apps\" aren't necessarily bound to the experience of \"opening up a web     browser as an explicit action, navigating to an application's web     site, and then interacting with it as if it were a web page.\"     Web-apps-as-first-class-apps is a viable model for development and deployment. And there is a team of people inside Mozilla who are working really hard to make this work as seamlessly as possible.<br /><br />Both FirefoxOS and BlackBerry 10 <i>inherently</i> treat     HTML5/JavaScript applications as \"first class\" apps. In FirefoxOS,     it's the sole means of developing applications; and BlackBerry 10     uses it as one of <a href=\"http://developer.blackberry.com/develop/platform_choice/index.html\">several native development    environments</a>. In both cases, the user's experience is     indistinguishable from what they're used to apps doing: there isn't     even an intermediating browser anywhere in the mix. The HTML5 and     JavaScript engines are an inbuilt part of both operating systems. <br /><br />I recognize that neither platform has the penetration to be a real game changer, at least, not at the moment. I'm holding them up as existence proofs     that the approach of \"web app as native app\" is viable. But let's     talk about how these technologies can be leveraged for native webapp deployment on Android, iOS, and Desktop systems.<br /><br />All of these systems have their own idea of \"installed applications.\"     To be successful, we need some way to make these     HTML5/JavaScript applications look, act, and feel like every other     kind of application (rather than \"something running in a web browser).<br /><br />This is where the work that Mozilla has been doing for web app deployment comes into play, and it's easier to demonstrate than it is to explain. If you have Firefox installed on your desktop (or     Firefox Aurora on your Android device), you can go to     <a class=\"moz-txt-link-freetext\" href=\"https://marketplace.firefox.com/\">https://marketplace.firefox.com/</a>, find apps that amuse you, and     click on \"install.\" At that point, Firefox takes the steps necessary     to put an icon in whatever location you're used to finding your     applications. On your Android device, you get an application icon. Under OS X, you get a new application in Launchpad. For Windows, you get... well, whatever your version of Windows uses to access installed apps.<br /><br />From that point forward, the distinction between these web apps     and native applications is impossible for users to discern.<br /><br />Interestingly, iOS was both a bit of a pioneer in this space, and     also remains the most frustrating platform in this regard. If you     recall Apple's stance when the original iPhone first launched, they     didn't allow third-party applications at all. Instead, their story     was that HTML and JavaScript were powerful enough to develop     whatever applications people want to write. Presumably as part of     this legacy, iOS still allows users to manually save \"bookmarks\" to     their desktop. If the content behind those bookmarks is iOS-aware,     then the bookmarks open in a way that hides the browser controls --     effectively acting like a native app. If you have an iOS device, you     can play around with how compelling this experience can be by going     to <a class=\"moz-txt-link-freetext\" href=\"http://slashdot.org/\">http://slashdot.org/</a> -- select the box-and-arrow icon at the     bottom of your browser, and click \"Add to Home Screen.\" Now,     whenever you open the newly-created icon, it acts and feels exactly     like you downloaded and installed a native \"Slashdot\" application     onto your device. It even appears in the task management bar as a     separate application.<br /><br />The reason the iOS experience remains frustrating is twofold. First,     and primarily an annoyance to developers: the only HTML5/JavaScript     rendering engine allowed on the platform is Apple's own webkit     implementation. This frustrates the ability to add new APIs, such as     may be required for new applications. So, new APIs are only added at     whatever pace Apple's product plan gets them added. Secondly -- and     of actual concern to users -- there is no programmatic way to add     web app icons to the desktop. Creating these icons requires a     relatively arcane series of user steps (described above). Basically,     Apple is playing the role of the napping hare in this     tortoise-and-hare race: they were very fast out the gate, but have     been asleep for quite a while now.<br /><br />But that covers all the bases: it's possible to develop HTML5/JavaScript apps that truly run     cross-platform for iOS, Android, Blackberry, FirefoxOS, and a variety of desktop systems     -- even if the Apple experience is somewhat less than satisfying     (for both developers and users).<br /><br />I suspect most of what's holding developers back is predominantly a     lack of knowledge that this is a viable technical model. I've heard developer feedback that one major reason they aren't targeting JavaScript environments involve concerns about     the speed of execution in a JavaScript environment. It's not yet clear whether these problems are merely perception or reality.  I've seen some impressive     things like <a href=\"http://polycrypt.net/\">usable cryptography</a>, <a href=\"https://brendaneich.com/2013/05/today-i-saw-the-future/\">high-def video codec decoding</a>, <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">and high-performance first-person 3D environments</a> (including <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/bananabread\">    viable multiplayer first-person shooters</a>) implemented in pure JavaScript, so I suspect it's more a perception problem based on very outdated experiences. I'd love feedback from anyone who has run into performance problems trying to use this model with a modern JavaScript interpreter.</div>" nil nil "d5492f061621985c7b7d5394725ea042") (539 (21001 59610 560179) "http://whereswalden.com/2013/08/12/micro-feature-from-es6-now-in-firefox-aurora-and-nightly-binary-and-octal-numbers/" "Jeff Walden: Micro-feature from ES6, now in Firefox Aurora and Nightly: binary and octal numbers" "Jeff" "Tue, 13 Aug 2013 02:51:32 +0000" "<p>A couple years ago when SpiderMonkey’s implementation of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode\">strict mode</a> was completed, I <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/01/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-in-firefox-4/\">observed</a> that strict mode forbids octal number syntax.  There was some evidence that novice programmers used leading zeroes as alignment devices, leading to unexpected results:</p>
<pre class=\"code\">var sum = 015 + // === 13, not 15!
197;
// sum === 210, <em>not</em> 212
</pre>
<p>But some users (Mozilla extensions and server-side <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">node.js</a> packages in particular) still want octal syntax, usually for file permissions.  <abbr title=\"ECMAScript, 6th edition\">ES6</abbr> thus adds new octal syntax that won’t trip up novices.  Hexadecimal numbers are formed with the prefix <code>0x</code> or <code>0X</code> followed by hexadecimal digits.  Octal numbers are similarly formed using <code>0o</code> or <code>0O</code> followed by octal digits:</p>
<pre class=\"code\">var DEFAULT_PERMS = 0o644; // kosher anywhere, including strict mode code
</pre>
<p>(Yes, <a href=\"https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2012-January/019784.html\">it was intentional</a> to allow the <code>0O</code> prefix [zero followed by a capital O] despite its total unreadability.  Consistency trumped readability in TC39, as I learned when <a href=\"https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2013-July/032192.html\">questioning the wisdom of <code>0O</code> as prefix</a>.  I think that decision is debatable, and the alternative is certainly not <a href=\"https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2012-January/019784.html\">“nanny language design”</a>.  But I don’t much care as long as I never see it.  <img alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://whereswalden.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" />   I recommend never using the capital version and applying a <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cluestick\">cluestick</a> to anyone who does.)</p>
<p>Some developers also need binary syntax, which ECMAScript has never provided.  ES6 thus adds analogous binary syntax using the letter <code>b</code> (lowercase or uppercase):</p>
<pre class=\"code\">var FLT_SIGNBIT  = 0b10000000000000000000000000000000;
var FLT_EXPONENT = 0b01111111100000000000000000000000;
var FLT_MANTISSA = 0b00000000011111111111111111111111;
</pre>
<p>Try out both new syntaxes in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/aurora/\">Firefox Aurora</a> or, if you’re feeling adventurous, in a <a href=\"http://nightly.mozilla.org/\">Firefox nightly</a>.  Use the <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles\">profile manager</a> if you don’t want your regular Firefox browsing history touched.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever needed octal or binary numbers, hopefully these additions will brighten your day a little.  <img alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://whereswalden.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>" nil nil "934f931eba9a936f3ed54ca3ed213e61") (538 (21001 59610 559534) "http://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2013/08/13/using-include-what-you-use/" "Nicholas Nethercote: Using include-what-you-use" "Nicholas Nethercote" "Tue, 13 Aug 2013 01:10:59 +0000" "<p><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/include-what-you-use/\">include-what-you-use</a> (a.k.a.

<p>After that, configure a Mozilla tree for a clang build and then run <code>make</code> with the following options: <code>-j1 -k CXX=/home/njn/local/src/llvm/build/Release/bin/include-what-you-use</code>. I’m not certain if the <code>-j1</code> is necessary, but since IWYU spits out lots of output, it seemed wise. The <code>-k</code> tells <code>make</code> to keep building even after errors; for some reason, IWYU triggers compilation failure on every file it looks at.</p>
<p>Pipe the output to a file, and you’ll see lots of stuff like this.</p>

<p>I focused on addressing the “should remove these lines” #includes, and I did it manually. There’s also a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=789028\">script</a> you can use to automatically do everything for you;  I don’t know how well it works.</p>
<p>Note that IWYU’s output is just plain wrong about 5% of the time — i.e. it says you can remove #includes that you clearly cannot.  (A lot of the time this seems to be because it hasn’t realized that a macro is needed.)  I also found that, while it produced output for all .cpp files, it only produced output for some of the .h files.  No idea why. Finally, it doesn’t know about local idioms; in particular, if you have platform-dependent code, its suggestions are often terrible because it only sees the files for the platform you are building on.</p>

Long live the HTML parser!" "mrbkap" "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 20:26:26 +0000" "<p>Many years ago, I got my start contributing to Mozilla by <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/mrbkap/2011/03/23/how-i-got-started-at-mozilla/\">working on the <q>new</q> HTML parser</a>. At the time that I was starting to contribute, there were big changes happening in Mozilla-land, most notably AOL laying off basically all of its Netscape engineers. With that stroke, the available manpower working on Gecko shrank to a shadow of its former self, leaving large portions of the codebase unowned. Naturally, this meant that the least sexy portions of the code received even less attention than before and the parser, which had not been actively worked on (except to fix critical bugs) fell even further onto the back-burner. The reasons for this abandonment were not only due to the fact that HTML parsers are not the most exciting thing in the world to work on, but also because of a few other factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code was very poorly documented, with many comments being incomprehensible. Understanding the code required reading both the immediately surrounding code as well as most of the rest of the class. In addition, there were often many ways of stating a simple constraint (e.g.  <q>HTML element <code>A</code> can contain HTML element <code>B</code></q>), each one with its own subtle side-effects.</li>
<li>The algorithm used was non-deterministic with regards to HTTP packet boundaries! When <a href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/\">HTML5</a> was introduced, this one factor was the reason that Ian Hickson ignored Gecko’s algorithm entirely when specifying what <em>should</em> happen.</li>
<li>The coding style used in the relevant source files was unlike any other code in the tree (as well as being both terse and overly verbose at the same time).</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, when Mozilla made the decision to switch to an HTML5 parser, we decided to go with a new parser entirely. <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/\">Henri Sivonen</a> was kind enough to figure out how to hook his existing implementation up to Gecko (including an automatic translation from Java to C++). We were able to switch over to this new parser for everything except parsing the magical <code>about:blank</code> page. Henri has been working on fixing that; however, in the meantime, we’ve been schlepping the old code around with us. The other day, I decided to remove the parts of the old parser that were no longer useful to its remaining use (that is, everything that didn’t simply output a blank document).</p>
<p>The result of all this is that with <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=903912\">bug 903912</a> landed, the old parser is basically gone. The most complicated bits have been torn out and we now only have one HTML parser in the tree.</p>" nil nil "a0c5d9fc2f539c2059bf574cfc7cb608") (535 (21001 59610 556075) "http://bookmaniac.org/supporting-the-ada-initiative-and-making-more-room/" "Liz Henry: Supporting The Ada Initiative, and making more room" "Liz Henry" "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 03:37:21 +0000" "<p>People ask me all the time what they can do to help change our culture.

<pre>18:41 < froydnj> \"constexpr constructor never produces a constant expression\"? what does *that* mean?
18:42 < philor> sweet, now you know what *every* compiler message sounds like to me</pre>
<p>Searching the web for the error was also unhelpful. There was a Qt bug report from a year ago that wasn’t relevant and a smattering of pages discussing just how smart the compiler needs to be to diagnose invalid constant expressions. The closest hit was from a <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45923#c13\">GCC bug on <tt>constexpr</tt> diagnostics</a>. But even that didn’t quite tell the whole story. So what’s going on here?</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what a literal type was, so I looked it up. The <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3337.pdf\">epsilon-close-to-the-standard draft, N3337</a>, defines the term literal type in [basic.types] paragraph 10 (you’ll usually see this abbreviated to just [basic.types]p10 in discussions or compiler front-end comments; I’ll be abbreviating standard references from here on out):</p>
<blockquote><p>A type is a <cite>literal type</cite> if it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a scalar type; or</li>
<li>a reference type referring to a literal type; or</li>
<li>an array of literal type; or</li>
<li>a class type (Clause 9) that has all of the following properties:
<ul>
<li>it has a trivial destructor,</li>
<li>every constructor call and full-expression in the <cite>brace-or-equal-initializers</cite> for non-static data<br />
members (if any) is a constant expression (5.19),</li>
<li>it is an aggregate type (8.5.1) or has at least one <tt>constexpr</tt> constructor or constructor template<br />
that is not a copy or move constructor, and</li>
<li>all of its non-static data members and base classes are of literal types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That bit explains how we have a non-literal type in debug builds: debug builds define a no-op protected destructor. Since that destructor is user-provided and not defaulted, it is non-trivial (in the language of the standard; you can read [class.dtor]p5 for the definition of trivial destructors and [class.ctor]p5 for the definition of trivial constructors). The destructor therefore fails the first property of a literal class type, above. (In debug builds, we define a protected destructor to ensure that nobody is improperly deleting our type. But in opt builds, we don’t define the constructor so that it becomes compiler-defaulted and optimized away properly by intelligent frontends. And that means that any static instances of <tt>nsSMILNullType</tt> don’t need static constructors.)</p>
<p>OK, but why is having a non-literal type a problem? The compiler ought to simply execute the constructor normally and not worry about the <tt>constexpr</tt> annotation, right? Except that there is this bit in the definition of constant expressions, [expr.const]p2: “A <cite>conditional-expression</cite> is a <cite>constant-expression</cite> unless it involves one of the following as a potentially evaluated subexpression…: …an invocation of a function other than a <tt>constexpr</tt> constructor for a literal class or a <tt>constexpr</tt> function”</p>
<p>Aha! Here is our real problem. We are claiming that the constructor of <tt>nsSMILNullType</tt> is <tt>constexpr</tt>, but actually executing that constructor in an expression is by definition not a constant expression. And so Clang issues an error, as it should.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: don’t define destructors for classes that you give <tt>constexpr</tt> constructors to…unless you can default them. Guess we might have <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=900134\">to add MOZ_DEFAULT to MFBT</a> after all!</p>" nil nil "44da9878ec08539a2749197a75e3fc49") (529 (21000 62157 28054) "http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2013/08/12/transitioning-into-a-new-role-at-mozilla/" "Doug Belshaw: Transitioning into a new role at Mozilla" "Doug Belshaw" "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 13:20:49 +0000" "<p><strong>TL;DR version:</strong> My ‘home’ at Mozilla is moving from the <a href=\"http://openbadges.org\">Open Badges</a> team to the Mentor team.

<hr />
<p>I joined the <a href=\"http://mozilla.org/foundation\">Mozilla Foundation</a> as Badges & Skills Lead 14 months ago. I’ve never really had a job description as such but, from the start, the plan was for me to work within (what was then) the Learning Team as an <a href=\"http://openbadges.org\">Open Badges</a> evangelist/advocate in Europe. And, while I wasn’t doing that, I was working on a Web Literacies framework to underpin Mozilla’s <a href=\"http://webmaker.org\">Webmaker</a> programme. I ended up writing <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard/Legacy/WebLiteraciesWhitePaper\">this white paper</a>.</p>
<p>With the help of a burgeoning community, we pivoted the Web Literacies framework I came up with into a <a href=\"http://mzl.la/weblitstd\">Web Literacy Standard</a>. Excitingly, it’s gaining some traction – and should gain even more when we launch v1.0 at the <a href=\"http://mozillafestival.org/\">Mozilla Festival</a> in October.</p>
<p>I’m delighted that Open Badges has become wildly successful; it seems not a day goes by without another big announcement with a big name backing it or an organisation aligning with it. I think that’s for all of the reasons that drew me to the project <a href=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2011/08/07/semester-of-learning-open-badges-and-assessment/\">back in 2011</a> before I joined Mozilla.</p>
<p>The world doesn’t really need me out there all the time telling it how awesome badges are. There’s plenty of people doing that on Mozilla’s behalf. I’m not giving up my Open Badges evangelism completely* but I’ll be focusing more on the Web Literacy Standard. Given that we’re looking for people to align with the standard using Open Badges, there’s no escape in any case. <img alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> </p>
<p>We’ve got broadly three teams within the Mozilla Foundation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mentor team</strong> – work with educators to focus on teaching and learning the Web</li>
<li><strong>Open Badges team</strong> – build, maintain and work with organisations integrating with the Open Badges Infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>Webmaker team</strong> – build products like <a href=\"http://thimble.webmaker.org/\">Thimble</a> and <a href=\"http://popcorn.webmaker.org/\">Popcorn Maker</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll be floating across all three using the Web Literacy Standard as the glue to bind together the teams. I’d like to thank <a href=\"http://twitter.com/carlacasilli\">Carla Casilli</a> who’s worked with me over the last few months on the Web Literacy Standard. I’ll be reporting to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/chrislarry33\">Chris Lawrence</a> now instead of <a href=\"http://twitter.com/eknight\">Erin Knight</a>.</p>
<p>So to a great extent, it’s <em>as you were</em>. However, if I look at bit confused at any point when you meet me you’ll now know why: I’m getting to grips with a slightly different role that will shift my landscape and day-to-day interactions a bit. <img alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>

<p>I’ve noticed that on many teams I’ve been a part of, not just at Mozilla, people tend to think that I am “lashing out”, or argumentative, and this, they assume, is not productive. I disagree entirely.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Peltzman_effect\">The Peltzman Effect</a> shows us that when people perceive a low level of risk (ie when they feel protected) they act less cautiously, and when they perceive a high level of risk they act more cautiously. It is my hypothesis that the same rule can be applied to intelligence. That is to say that when people feel more protected they will think less, and when they feel they have less protection they think more.</p>
<p>So how can this hypothesis be applied to team work?</p>
<p>Well before we dive in to the counterintuitive, let’s evaluate the concept of the yes-man, otherwise known as a sycophanct. The sycophanct does not use his/her own intelligence, ever, they always say “Yes” to their leader(s), and it should be obvious to all why a team of sycophancts would produce bad products. But why does the sycophanct behave this way? the answer is simple, they do it because it is low risk. If the idea is a good one, they agreed with a good idea, if the idea is a bad one then they cannot be blammed for it, because it was the leader who decided it was good, not the sycophanct.</p>
<p>So since we all know intuitively that a team of yes-men is obviously bad, why is it that some people think a team of people that are willing to say “No” is not good? The answer I suspect is pride.</p>
<p>In a team of people that are willing to say “No” pride is at risk, and in a team where people are concerned more about their pride than the productivity of the team someone that is willing to say “No” stands out, and risks being called a bad team-mate.</p>
<p>In my opionin personal attacks are unproductive, but attacking ideas should be completely necessary in producing an effective team, which would be most capable of producing the highest quality products.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Peltzman_effect\">The Peltzman Effect</a> shows us this.</p>
<p>If a member of a team feels no risk in submitting bad ideas to their team, then they will do so, because good ideas take more time to think through. However if a member of a team feels higher risk associated to submitting bad ideas, like having the idea publicly denounced, then they will think about it more, and produce a higher quality idea. Furthermore, if after thinking about their idea long and hard, they submit something that has flaws, then in a team of yes-men the poor idea will not be challenged, whereas in a team of no-men the idea will be challenged until the highest quality idea that the whole team is capable of is produced. This doesn’t mean that everyone will agree on the final decision of course, ultimately when there is disagreement and no way to bridge the gap, someone will have to make the final decision, and this person should be a cool headed mediator in my opinion, someone that is capable of collecting all of the facts, and calibrating their own opinions and emotions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion for Mozilla</h3>
<h4>Secret Meetings Are Bad</h4>
<p>In Vidyo/Skype meetings, who said what is lost, and therefore it is a safe place for people for submit bad ideas. Instead all discussion of any important should be written down and made public. If someone is worried about their pride call them out on it, they should expect that their ideas will be attacked, and they should be able to tell the difference between that and a personal attack. The former should be expected, and the latter should not be tolerated.</p>
<h4>Mediators Not Leaders</h4>
<p>We should not have leaders, but instead we should have mediators. If the people that are most passoniate about their own ideas are promoted then we will have teams of yes-men producing crap, if we instead promote the mediators, then we will have effective teams producing awesomeness.</p>
<h4>Drop The Torpedoes!</h4>
<p>If you are on a team, and you don’t agree with some idea, then be publically vocal about why you think it is bad, remember it is important to attack ideas and not the people behind them, this doesn’t mean you can’t use their name, but it does mean you should try to refrain from doing so. If you lean towards agreeing with the idea, then play devil’s advocate. The important part here is to be public, because that increases the risk for your team mates in having bad ideas, because they will be associated with the bad idea, and that should make them think harder next time.</p>

<h4>We All Make Mistakes</h4>
<p>Nobody is perfect, try to remember that. Those that smirk at you when you fall down, make a mistake, or have a bad idea are forgetting that they too are fallible, and if you remember this, then you will be not only wiser than they, but also a more beautiful human being.</p>

<p>The Reps Portal gets about 250 visitors each day, which is pretty impressive considering there are just under 400 Reps. The average person visits the site for 4 minutes 18 seconds. Amazingly, Reps are organizing and participating in over 1,000 events each year. Reps are organizing more events than any other group in Mozilla.</p>
<p>The core functionality of the Reps Portal is composed of profiles, events, monthly reports and a dashboard. Most recently, we have released a voting feature so Reps can vote and comment on polls, which help different groups and the program as a whole make decisions. We’re also planning to use the voting feature to approve swag and budget requests for events.</p>
<p>Some of the most useful tools are highly specific. Here are two powerful features that you may not have noticed yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can automatically add events that interest you to your calendar. On the <a href=\"https://reps.mozilla.org/events/\">events page</a>, search for a location or any keyword, click the Advanced Options icon, and choose Export iCalendar. This will add a feed of those events to your personal calendar.</li>
<li>You can send an email to Mozillians attending an event. On an event page, simply click on Mail attendees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with a great site, there is plenty more we can do. We are working to improve how you interact with events on the site, switch to a better reporting system, and show more insights and actionable items on your dashboard.</p>
<p>The team working on the Reps Portal continues to grow, and we have 14 people contributing to the site.

<p>I’m one of the founding board members and advisors to the <a href=\"http://adainitiative.org/\">Ada Initiative</a>, a 501(c)3 charitable non-profit that supports women in open technology and culture. This year, I am supporting the organization through a <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/donate/\">donation of $1024.</a></p>
<p>My reasons for supporting the Ada Initiative, advocating for their work, and now donating are many. I started out working with open source software in 1996, as a sysadmin setting up backups for a small research lab at the University of Oregon. I’d installed Linux from floppies in 1994, and surrounded myself with other open source advocates, sysadmins, hackers and finally, computer science students. Open source software has defined my career, and most of what I’ve chosen to do with my life.</p>
<p>In those few years in college, I met only two women who were interested in open source software – one that I brought with me from Chemistry into the Computer Science program and a woman who worked in Academic Services. I met no other professors, fellow students or friends online to collaborate or talk with.</p>
<p>All my mentors and friends were men. And, to be honest, I never thought much about that. Growing up, I tended to hang out with boys or spend a lot of time alone. As I started to think about computers and programming as fundamentally changing society, as tools that enabled and could dramatically change lives, I felt discomfort that only men seemed to know the things I knew.</p>
<p>A critically important aspect of being involved in the work that the Ada Initiative does is simply introducing women to each other in our communities. I’ve attended all three AdaCamps – in Melbourne, AU, Washington DC and San Francisco. Each gathering was larger than the last, and I’ve had important conversations at each that have changed my thinking and my activism in significant ways.</p>
<p>My most striking realization is how little work is done to educate adult women about computer science, about open source and open culture. Most outreach efforts focus on children, with the implication that adults are some how “not worth the effort”, “beyond help”, or that adults will simply find the things that interest them on their own.</p>
<p>My experience with the Ada Initiative, and with <a href=\"http://pyladies.com\">PyLadies</a> contradicts everything that I had assumed, and everything that some advocates for early CS education for girls have implied — that the only way to change diversity is to start with a new generation of kids.</p>
<p>Adult women want the same skills that anyone interested in computers want. But there are important social and economic barriers to pursuing those goals.</p>
<p>The grassroots movement to educate adult women in writing software is inspiring. It reinforces my belief that it is never too late to learn these skills, and the women who seek out these classes inspire me with their dedication and fearlessness. Because of what I’ve learned and experienced, I’m now taking a break from the Ada Initiative advisors board to focus on my work with PyLadies.</p>
<p>Many people share my discomfort with a world whose code is only written by men. We’re making important changes in the way women view open technology and culture. We’re showing women that they definitely can learn and master these skills, that there are huge benefits to doing so and that women fundamentally belong in our communities. That work, I believe, also leads to the kind of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality\">intersectional</a> awakening about diversity that all community builders should have.</p>
<p>The work of the Ada Initiative is difficult, wonderful and making a huge difference in my life. <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/donate/\">Please join me in supporting the Ada Initiative in 2013</a>.</p>" nil nil "15f6851b157634c922dc7cd910125eba") (522 (21000 35646 145281) "http://work.erikvold.com/jetpack/2013/08/09/jep-menuitems.html" "Erik Vold: JEP Menuitems" "Erik Vold" "Fri, 09 Aug 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "<p>I’ve created a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/wiki/JEP-Menuitems\">Menuitem JEP</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/voldsoftware/menuitems-jplib\">based on my old third party module</a>.

<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/mrz/2011/10/06/my-job-after-5-558-years/\">October 2011</a> I asked the following question:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>“How can Mozilla IT impact the Mozilla Community?”</i></p>
<p>Within Mozilla IT I helped focus our efforts around three pillars:</p>
<ol>
<li>Community IT</li>
<li>Community/Volunteer Sysadmins</li>
<li>Air Mozilla</li>
</ol>
<p>I was even so bold to call out three specific goals for the end of 2012:</p>
<ol>
<li>to have 5-10 volunteer Community Sysadmins actively helping run Mozilla’s network and servers.</li>
<li>to have a vibrant Community IT group…</li>
<li>to have a premiere source for open source video technology, a site where the Mozilla Community can find, share and create video content</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel that I generally failed. Or rather, I did not meet the goals I set out.</p>
<p>But I’ve talked about <a href=\"http://mrz.velvet.org/2013/03/28/failure/\">failure before</a> and the Mozilla IT I left is not the same that it was in 2011. In fact, on behalf of my former team, I’ll claim the following two successes:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=\"https://air.mozilla.org/\"> Air Mozilla</a>.
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In 2011 this wasn’t a thing. No one cared about it.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Nearly a year later we were discussing specific policies on what we’d stream (public? internal?). A year later it was assumed everything we did would be streamed.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Air Mozilla became one of the primary communication tools at Mozilla.</p>
</li>
<li>Created infrastructure for <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/MCS:Hosting\">Community Website/Email Hosting</a>.
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Through Mozilla Reps, Mozilla IT worked to provide Email hosting for 13 communities and Website hosting for more than 29 hosted sites.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially, Mozilla IT literally <strong>empowered</strong> the Mozilla Community to promote the Mozilla Mission.</p>

<p>The way <a href=\"http://lloyd.io/how-browserid-works\">Persona normally works</a>, after checking to see if your email provider natively supports the protocol, is that Persona will fallback to what we call a secondary provider. This is the point where most users end up creating a password for Persona, and then going to their email to verify to us that they really own their email address. If the email provider <em>did</em> support the protocol, they would get sent over to them to authenticate, and we’d step out of the way.</p>
<p>So, we made an <a href=\"http://identity.mozilla.com/post/56526022621/what-is-an-identity-bridge\">Identity Bridge</a> that we host, and uses Google’s OpenID endpoint to verify the user. The experience is pretty much exactly what it should feel like if there was native support from Google.</p>
<h3>Why this matters</h3>
<p>With both Gmail and Yahoo bridges online, <em>over half of all users</em> are just a couple clicks away from logging in with Persona.</p>
<p>So how does this affect you? If you have a website that has user accounts, you can switch to using <a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/introduction-persona\">Persona as your authentication system</a>. In most cases, it should be a <strong>better</strong> experience for your users, and easier for you.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a website, you can still help. Find a website you log in to frequently, and ask them to implement Persona. Tell them about this new bridging. Push for the change.</p>
<p>Soon, everyone will notice: <strong>we made signing into the Internet awesomer.</strong></p>" nil nil "bcce5e7dcad6a7ff8b14c8692a15917f") (518 (20996 43043 433042) "http://work.erikvold.com/ux/2013/08/08/mo-usage-mo-problems.html" "Erik Vold: Mo Usage Mo Problems" "Erik Vold" "Thu, 08 Aug 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "<h3>The Facade</h3>
<p>How can a serious UX designer think that designing for the majority is all that is necessary? a good design is not merely useful to the users that hardly use a product, or are new to a product. A truely good design is instead good for those that use the product infrequently and those that use it frequently.</p>
<p>A good song is not a good song if you initially hate it, nor is it a good song if you liked it at first and then hated it after a few listens. If you like the song after a few years it is highly unlikely that you will hate it in a decade, thus it is a good song. If you dislike the song at any period in that interval then it was not well designed.</p>
<p>Furthermore the more you listen to a song, the more you should enjoy it, because you take more from it.</p>
<p>This is why Beethoven was a master composer.</p>
<h3><a href=\"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog\">Boiling A Frog</a></h3>
<p>It’s said that if a frog is placed in boiling water, then it will quickly jump out, but if it is placed in cold water that is slowly heated, it will be cooked to death.</p>
<p>This is not a good analogy to use for UX design. A good UX designer should not be focused on cooking their frogs, they should be focused on providing awesome ponds with lots of flies for their frogs.</p>

<p><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/firepicker/\">FirePicker</a> adds a small color picker dialog when editing a CSS rule in Firebug. The addon scans for values that can be parsed as CSS colors and displays them in a drop-down list right below the firebug's CSS editor box. Clicking on the color value in the drop-down brings up a color picker dialog.</p>

<h3>Multiple Colors</h3>
<p>The integration works well and the UI/UX is pretty intuitive, so let me just mention how multiple color support look like. In case there are more colors values specified for single CSS property Fire picker previews them all in the drop down list.</p>
<p>See an example.</p>
<div class=\"dean_ch\" style=\"white-space: wrap;\"><span class=\"sc3\"><span class=\"re1\"><html<span class=\"re2\">></span></span></span><br />
<span class=\"sc3\"><span class=\"re1\"><head<span class=\"re2\">></span></span></span><br />

  <span class=\"sc3\"><span class=\"re1\"><style<span class=\"re2\">></span></span></span><br />
  body {<br />
    border: 1px solid;<br />
    border-color: red green blue orange;<br />
  }<br />
  <span class=\"sc3\"><span class=\"re1\"></style<span class=\"re2\">></span></span></span><br />
<span class=\"sc3\"><span class=\"re1\"></head<span class=\"re2\">></span></span></span><br />
<span class=\"sc3\"><span class=\"re1\"><body<span class=\"re2\">></span></span></span>Hello World!<span class=\"sc3\"><span class=\"re1\"></body<span class=\"re2\">></span></span></span><br />
<span class=\"sc3\"><span class=\"re1\"></html<span class=\"re2\">></span></span></span></div>
<p>If you click the <code>border-color</code> CSS property value to edit it FirePicker displays a little preview for every color.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"366\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firepicker/multiple-colors.png\" width=\"520\" /></p>

<p>Last Wednesday, July 31, I left Mozilla as a full time paid-staff.</p>
<p><em>Seven years at Mozilla has fundamentally changed how I operate. It’s redefined my values and helped define my personal mission & purpose.<br />
</em></p>
<p>The impact I had on Mozilla and on the Mozilla Project extended far outside Mozilla IT Operations and I hope to continue to be connected to the Mozilla Project (but more on that in another post).</p>
<p>For now I’ll simply share the note I sent to Everyone@Mozilla:</p>
<h5>Adios, au revoir, sayonara</h5>
<hr />
<p>On March 15, 2006 I quietly joined Mozilla. Seven years and four months later, I quietly take my leave.  July 31 will be my last day here.</p>
<p>I had this moment of clarity awhile ago when I realized I have an awesome set of leaders under me and it was time, as Mitchell has said, to let them step into new roles and for me to step out.</p>
<p>To my Mozilla IT:</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I have enjoyed being there for you.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I have enjoyed seeing you grow.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I have enjoyed seeing you handle some crazy, complicated challenges.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I will miss the camaraderie we developed and shared with each other.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I will miss the late nights working with you.</p>
<p>You always worked with me, never for me. And as much as I tried to help you, you helped me.</p>
<p>For this, and much much more, I thank you.</p>
<p>To my friends,</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I made friends with people I worked with, people who are friends first and co-workers second.  I will miss seeing you every day. This is probably the hardest realization.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">You have helped me grow and become who I am today.</p>
<p>To All@Mozilla,</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In many ways, you, and this organization, have made an impact on me that cannot be undone.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">My thoughts and actions have been shaped by what we have collectively been accomplishing and what we have set out to accomplish.</p>
<p>I could write much much more, of course so I’ll just leave with this:</p>
<p><em>“Parting is such sweet sorrow that I shall say goodnight till it be morrow.”</em></p>

<p>I’ve been actively involved in open source projects since around 1997, and as part of Mozilla since 2005. During that time I’ve noticed that successful projects usually make do with a short list of relatively simple tools. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A version control & source code management system</li>
<li>A bug tracker</li>
<li>A mailing list (for asynchronous discussion)</li>
<li>An IRC channel (for synchronous discussion)</li>
<li>A wiki (for documentation, designs, meeting notes, and so on)</li>
<li>An etherpad install (for collaborative note taking & a host of other things)</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s really it. There are more elaborate tools, and there are more elaborate processes that can be built around them, but I have seen it proven time and again that if you have these tools and a good group of smart and dedicated people, you can literally change the world.</p>

This made me curious if it was possible to implement libraries in Rust and call them from C. After the meeting I asked in #rust and got pointed to some projects that showed the way.</p>
<p>This lead me to trying to come up with as simple example as possible of compiling a Rust file into an object file, linking it to a C program and running it without the Rust runtime. The code is in my <a href=\"https://github.com/doublec/rust-from-c-example\">rust-from-c-example</a> github repository. It can be cloned and built with:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone http://github.com/doublec/rust-from-c-example
$ cd rust-from-c-example
$ make
$ ./test</code></pre>
<p>To avoid issues with integrating with the Rust runtime I’ve opted to not use it. This means no threads and limits the standard library usage. This example is very simple, only demonstrating adding two numbers. Extending from this will be an interesting exercise to see how much Rust can be used.</p>
<p>The Rust code is:</p>
<pre><code>#[crate_type = \"lib\"];
#[no_std];
#[allow(ctypes)];
#[no_mangle]
pub extern fn add(lhs: uint, rhs: uint) -> uint {
lhs + rhs
}</code></pre>
<p>The first three lines ensure that the file is compiled as a library, does not use the standard library and can use C types. The <code>no_mangle</code> declaration stops the Rust default of mangling function names to include their module and version information. This means that <code>add</code> in Rust is exported as <code>add</code> for C programs. The <code>extern</code> makes the function available from C and defaults to <code>cdecl</code> calling format.</p>
<p>To generate a <code>.o</code> file that can be linked into a C program:</p>
<pre><code>$ rustc -c mylib.rs</code></pre>
<p>The C program creates an <code>extern</code> declaration for <code>add</code> and calls it:</p>
<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>
extern unsigned int add(unsigned int lhs, unsigned int rhs);
int main() {
printf(\"add(40,2) = %u\\n\", add(40,2));
return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately we can’t just compile and link with the <code>mylib.o</code> file. This results in a linker error:</p>
<pre><code>mylib.o: In function `add':
mylib.rc:(.text+0x4f): undefined reference to `upcall_call_shim_on_rust_stack'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status</code></pre>
<p>Some searching pointed me to <a href=\"https://github.com/neykov/armboot\">armboot</a> which had a stub implementation for this in <a href=\"https://github.com/neykov/armboot/blob/master/zero/zero.c\">zero.c</a>. Compiling and linking to that worked successfully. A cut down variant of <code>zero.c</code> is included in the project.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of limitations with this approach. We’re basically using Rust as a higher level C. This post on <a href=\"http://brson.github.io/2013/03/10/embedding-rust-in-ruby/\">embedding Rust in Ruby</a> details some of the limitations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When calling Rust code you will not be executing in a Rust task and will not have access to any runtime services that require task-local resources. Currently this means you can’t use the local heap, nor can you spawn or communicate with tasks, nor call fail!() to unwind the stack. I/O doesn’t work because core::io (unfortunately, and incorrectly) uses @-boxes. Even logging does not work. Calling any code that tries to access the task context will cause the process to abort. Because code is not executing in a task, it does not grow the stack, and instead runs on whatever stack the foreign caller was executing on. Recurse too deep and you will scribble on random memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully some of these limitations will go away or ‘zero runtime’ libraries will appear to make this sort of usage easier. Some resources that helped putting this together were:</p>

It’s been amazing to see our community grow, and I want to share some of the strategies we’ve been using to engage volunteers.<br /><br /><strong>1. Make it easy to get started.</strong> We maintain a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Get_Involved\">\"Get Involved\" page</a> with links to a bunch of resources to help newcomers get started, including clear and up-to-date <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android\">build instructions</a>. We also share some guidelines for how exactly to get started, including things like making sure you have a build environment set up before trying to dive into a bug, and how to reach out to us when you need help.<br /><br /><strong>2. Be available to help.</strong> Our team is always on <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC\">IRC</a>, and we’re quick to answer questions. We also make an effort to respond to Bugzilla comments/requests in a timely fashion, especially if we see it’s someone’s first bug. Helping newcomers can require patience, but being responsive is a really important part of keeping volunteers engaged.<br /><br /><strong>3. Create contribution opportunities.</strong> We mark bugs as <a href=\"http://www.joshmatthews.net/blog/2011/09/making-bugs-more-attractive-for-other-people-to-fix/\">mentor bugs</a> as often as we can. In addition to simple “good first bugs”, we also try to mark more challenging bugs as mentor opportunities. The key with that is to set clear expectations about how challenging we expect the bug to be, and redirect newcomers to easier bugs if they find themselves in one that’s too hard.<br /><br /><strong>4. Recognize contributors.</strong> We made a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Notes/07-Aug-2013#Friends_of_the_Mobile_Team\">\"Friends of the Mobile Team\"</a> section of our weekly meeting notes, where we call out volunteer contributions that were made over the past week. We recently created a <a href=\"https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/badge/Friends-of-the-Mobile-Team\">badge</a> that we award to anyone who appears in this section (people love badges!) and we also try to publicize important contributions with our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FennecNightly\">@FennecNightly</a> Twitter account.<br /><br /><strong>5. Develop a culture of mentorship.</strong> This last point is a bit harder to act on, but it’s the most important. A big part of why we have more (and stronger) volunteer contributors is that we’ve taken the time to mentor them. On our team, most developers have mentored at least one bug (if not many), and make an effort to mark bugs as mentor bugs whenever they can. We also make a big effort to remain patient and friendly, and I think that attitude has spread through our community. One of the greatest rewards of developing this culture is seeing new contributors evolve into mentors themselves. It is an amazing feeling to watch some of the volunteers I mentored helping newcomers write their first patches, and do so with so much kindness and patience.<br /><br />I’ve been having lots of fun bringing new people into our team, and I’d love to help other teams at Mozilla do the same.

<p></p>
<p>Prior to the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=649537\" target=\"_blank\">great worker rewrite of 2011</a> exposing DOM objects in workers was pretty easy.  The same XPIDL/XPConnect layer that was used for most of the DOM worked off the main thread, and as long as the underlying implementation of your DOM object was threadsafe and you added a way to create the object in a worker or transfer it in (via postMessage) things just worked.  In fact, you could even <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ChromeWorker#Using_XPCOM_from_chrome_workers\" target=\"_blank\">send arbitrary threadsafe XPCOM objects</a> to ChromeWorkers.  But it turns out that XPConnect and the JS engine were not really threadsafe, and that we couldn’t share XPConnect and the JS engine state between threads.  So bent rewrote workers to use a separate JSRuntime.</p>
<p>XPConnect didn’t come along for the ride though.  Instead we took the opportunity to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=649537#c7\" target=\"_blank\">prototype</a> the next <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=580070\" target=\"_blank\">iteration</a> of <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/jorendorff/2008/10/09/quick-stubs/\" target=\"_blank\">quickstubs</a>.  XPConnect does a lot of work in each function call that can be done at compile time, at the cost of larger codesize.  As performance has become more and more important and codesize has mattered less, we have been moving towards using more and more generated code in the “binding” layer and less dynamic conversion and dispatch via XPConnect.  So workers got the first iteration of what would become the <a href=\"http://jstenback.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/new-dom-bindings/\" target=\"_blank\">WebIDL bindings</a>: a handwritten JSAPI binding layer.</p>
<p>This binding layer ended up diverging from what we did for the main thread in a number of ways.  Most notably memory management is handled quite differently.  One of the hardest problems in web browsers is how to handle cross-language cycles.  References from JS to the language the browser is implemented in (C++ in existing browsers) are ubiquitous.  But references from browser code to JS can exist too (e.g. event listeners).  Once references can exist in both directions, there’s the possibility for cycles.  There are 3 options for dealing with these cycles:</p>
<ol><li>Use a separate memory management system for C++, and have special purpose code that glues these two systems together.  This is what Gecko does on the main thread with the <a href=\"http://rickeyre.ca/2013/06/20/webvtt-cycle-collector-demo.html\" target=\"_blank\">cycle collector</a>.  C++ side objects are usually reference counted, and the cycle collector breaks both pure C++ and C++-JS cycles.  It also handles tracing the JS objects owned by C++.</li>
<li>Use the JS garbage collector to manage the lifetimes of the C++ objects too.  This is what we chose to do on the worker threads.  In this setup there are never any C++->C++ edges, a C++ object owns the JS reflection of the C++ object it wants to keep alive.</li>
<li>Implement something hacky for event listeners and hope that nobody ever wants to implement an API that requires other sorts of C++->JS edges.  This is the <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2012JulSep/0054.html\" target=\"_blank\">WebKit approach</a>.</li>
</ol><p>Option 3 is obviously a non-starter.  Option 2 is potentially what we would do on both threads if we were writing a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.servo/ufJM51SF3G4/8qhJFUbHR9QJ\" target=\"_blank\">browser from scratch,</a> but it is a pretty severe impedance mismatch with the rest of Gecko.  Code that wanted to work on both threads would have to be written to own C++ and cycle collect on one thread and own JS and manually trace it on another.  This, combined with the lack of automated binding generation, has made adding new APIs to workers essentially impossible for people who aren’t already seasoned DOM hackers.</p>
<p>The WebIDL code generator solved the problem of writing the binding layer manually.  At the DOM meetup in London back in February we had a meeting where the rest of us overruled bent and decided to move workers to the cycle collector.  This involved some pretty serious refactoring work.  We had to separate a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=882162\" target=\"_blank\">large amount</a> of <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=885866\" target=\"_blank\">code </a>from XPConnect so it could be used on both threads, while adding some customization hooks so that XPConnect could insert some of the strange behavior that only the main thread needs.  Then we were finally able to stand up a worker thread <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=845545\" target=\"_blank\">cycle collector implementation</a> and port <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/c3ae42b64ce9#l4.1\" target=\"_blank\">ImageData </a>to use it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this work was repeatedly delayed.  First by <a href=\"http://robert.ocallahan.org/2013/05/taiwan-travelogue.html\" target=\"_blank\">travel</a>, then by the length of bent’s <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/request.cgi?action=queue&requester=&product=&type=all&requestee=%3Abent&component=&group=type&do_union=1\" target=\"_blank\">review queue</a>, later by <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=893012\" target=\"_blank\">some</a> <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=896755\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a> <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=897701\" target=\"_blank\">OS</a> <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=896825\" target=\"_blank\">work</a>, and then by the effort needed to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=897433#c27\" target=\"_blank\">unbitrot </a>the patches from some other cycle collector changes.  All of this led to a Q2 goal slipping a third of the way through Q3.  But it is finally done, and future work should allow more opportunities for parallelism.  Some of the existing worker thread objects can be converted to use the cycle collector without waiting for events.  Other APIs can be ported to worker threads now if they don’t use events.  And Olli can work on <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853893\" target=\"_blank\">events</a> now that I am no longer blocking him.</p>
<p>Best of all, we have some plans in the works to port some <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709490\" target=\"_blank\">very interesting stuff</a> to workers.  Keep your eyes peeled for more.</p>" nil nil "46b6cf85252c5ca4cab560ed89d1547a") (504 (20994 22698 416391) "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HackingForChrist/~3/_KxWf2pBcAM/" "Gervase Markham: Copying Permissively-Licensed Code Into MPL 2 Files" "gerv" "Wed, 07 Aug 2013 13:21:59 +0000" "<p>Mozilla has always used some permissively-licensed (MIT/BSD) code, and more recently started using and now creating (most prominently in Gaia) Apache 2-licensed code.

This made me curious if it was possible to implement libraries in Rust and call them from C. After the meeting I asked in #rust and got pointed to some projects that showed the way.</p>
<p>This lead me to trying to come up with as simple example as possible of compiling a Rust file into an object file, linking it to a C program and running it without the Rust runtime. The code is in my <a href=\"https://github.com/doublec/rust-from-c-example\">rust-from-c-example</a> github repository. It can be cloned and built with:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone http://github.com/doublec/rust-from-c-example
$ cd rust-from-c-example
$ make
$ ./test</code></pre>
<p>To avoid issues with integrating with the Rust runtime I’ve opted to not use it. This means no threads and limits the standard library usage. This example is very simple, only demonstrating adding two numbers. Extending from this will be an interesting exercise to see how much Rust can be used.</p>
<p>The Rust code is:</p>
<pre><code>#[crate_type = \"lib\"];
#[no_std];
#[allow(ctypes)];
#[no_mangle]
pub extern fn add(lhs: uint, rhs: uint) -> uint {
lhs + rhs
}</code></pre>
<p>The first three lines ensure that the file is compiled as a library, does not use the standard library and can use C types. The <code>no_mangle</code> declaration stops the Rust default of mangling function names to enclude their module and version information. This ensures that <code>add</code> in Rust is exported as <code>add</code> for C programs. The <code>extern</code> makes the function available from C and defaults to <code>cdecl</code> calling format.</p>
<p>To generate a <code>.o</code> file that can be linked into a C program:</p>
<pre><code>$ rustc -c mylib.rs</code></pre>
<p>The C program creates an <code>extern</code> declaration for <code>add</code> and calls it:</p>
<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>
extern unsigned int add(unsigned int lhs, unsigned int rhs);
int main() {
printf(\"add(40,2) = %u\\n\", add(40,2));
return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately we can’t just compile and link with the <code>mylib.o</code> file. This results in a linker error:</p>
<pre><code>mylib.o: In function `add':
mylib.rc:(.text+0x4f): undefined reference to `upcall_call_shim_on_rust_stack'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status</code></pre>
<p>Some searching pointed me to <a href=\"https://github.com/neykov/armboot\">armboot</a> which had a stub implementation for this in <a href=\"https://github.com/neykov/armboot/blob/master/zero/zero.c\">zero.c</a>. Compiling and linking to that worked successfully. A cut down variant of <code>zero.c</code> is included in the project.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of limitations with this approach. We’re basically using Rust as a higher level C. This post on <a href=\"http://brson.github.io/2013/03/10/embedding-rust-in-ruby/\">embedding Rust in Ruby</a> details some of the limitations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When calling Rust code you will not be executing in a Rust task and will not have access to any runtime services that require task-local resources. Currently this means you can’t use the local heap, nor can you spawn or communicate with tasks, nor call fail!() to unwind the stack. I/O doesn’t work because core::io (unfortunately, and incorrectly) uses @-boxes. Even logging does not work. Calling any code that tries to access the task context will cause the process to abort. Because code is not executing in a task, it does not grow the stack, and instead runs on whatever stack the foreign caller was executing on. Recurse too deep and you will scribble on random memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully some of these limitations will go away or ‘zero runtime’ libraries will appear to make this sort of usage easier. Some resources that helped putting this together were:</p>

<p>Finally, Luke Wagner <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=880538\">greatly reduced the peak memory usage seen during parsing large asm.js examples</a>.  For the <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">Unreal demo</a>, this reduced the peak from 881MB to 6MB, and reduced start-up time by 1.5 seconds!  Luke also <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=899832\">slightly reduced the size of JSScript</a>, which is one of the very common structures on the JS GC heap, thus reducing pressure on the GC heap, which is always a good thing.</p>

It’s been amazing to see our community grow, and I want to share some of the strategies we’ve been using to engage volunteers.<br /><br /><strong>1. Make it easy to get started.</strong> We maintain a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Get_Involved\">\"Get Involved\" page</a> with links to a bunch of resources to help newcomers get started, including clear and up-to-date <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android\">build instructions</a>. We also share some guidelines for how exactly to get started, including things like making sure you have a build environment set up before trying to dive into a bug, and how to reach out to us when you need help.<br /><br /><strong>2. Be available to help.</strong> Our team is always on <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC\">IRC</a>, and we’re quick to answer questions. We also make an effort to respond to Bugzilla comments/requests in a timely fashion, especially if we see it’s someone’s first bug. Helping newcomers can require patience, but being responsive is a really important part of keeping volunteers engaged.<br /><br /><strong>3. Create contribution opportunities.</strong> We mark bugs as <a href=\"http://www.joshmatthews.net/blog/2011/09/making-bugs-more-attractive-for-other-people-to-fix/\">mentor bugs</a> as often as we can. In addition to simple “good first bugs\", we also try to mark more challenging bugs as mentor opportunities. The key with that is to set clear expectations about how challenging we expect the bug to be, and redirect newcomers to easier bugs if they find themselves in one that’s too hard.<br /><br /><strong>4. Recognize contributors.</strong> We made a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Notes/07-Aug-2013#Friends_of_the_Mobile_Team\">\"Friends of the Mobile Team\"</a> section of our weekly meeting notes, where we call out volunteer contributions that were made over the past week. We recently created a <a href=\"https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/badge/Friends-of-the-Mobile-Team\">badge</a> that we award to anyone who appears in this section (people love badges!) and we also try to publicize important contributions with our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FennecNightly\">@FennecNightly</a> Twitter account.<br /><br /><strong>5. Develop a culture of mentorship.</strong> This last point is a bit harder to act on, but it’s the most important. A big part of why we have more (and stronger) volunteer contributors is that we’ve taken the time to mentor them. On our team, most developers have mentored at least one bug (if not many), and make an effort to mark bugs as mentor bugs whenever they can. We also make a big effort to remain patient and friendly, and I think that attitude has spread through our community. One of the greatest rewards of developing this culture is seeing new contributors evolve into mentors themselves. It is an amazing feeling to watch some of the volunteers I mentored helping newcomers write their first patches, and do so with so much kindness and patience.<br /><br />I’ve been having lots of fun bringing new people into our team, and I’d love to help other teams at Mozilla do the same.

It depends on an attacker being able to notice a small difference in response size between two very similar requests.</p>
<p>Therefore, various mitigation methods which have been proposed involve attempting to disguise the length of a response. Some have said that this is mathematically infeasible, in that there is no way of disguising it enough without destroying the compression performance to such a degree that you might as well just switch compression off. I am not qualified to assess that claim, but I did have an idea as to how to add arbitrary length to the response in a transparent way.</p>
<p>My suggestion to vary the length is to add some non-determinism to gzip on the server side. This has the significant advantage of being transparent both to the application being served and to the client – it requires no changes to either. This makes it much easier to deploy than mechanisms which pad the content itself, or add data which needs to be explicitly ignored on the client. A quick review of the <a href=\"http://www.gzip.org/algorithm.txt\">algorithm</a> suggests that there are several places where you could introduce non-determinism. </p>
<p>The gzip algorithm either reproduces a string of bytes literally or, if that string has occurred before, replaces it with a pointer-length pair to a previously-occurring string of bytes. I suggest that the way that adds most variability to the output length would be to have gzip either not shorten a string, or shorten it to less than the maximum possible shortening, on some small percentage of occasions when it would otherwise do a full compression. The question is whether one can add enough length non-determinism to make the leaky length difference hard to detect without many repetitions and statistical analysis (which would drastically slow down the attack), without destroying the compression performance.</p>
<p>This scheme can be used to add arbitrary amounts of additional length (up to the original size of the file) in arbitrary places and patterns, dependent on static or variable factors. </p>
<p>As determinism may be an expected feature of gzip in some contexts, it would probably need to be made an option (which mod_gzip and similar libraries would invoke).</p>
<p>As an opening (and probably terrible) proposal for a static random length increase, I suggest that for each replaced sequence in the file, gzip decides either to replace it fully with a pointer+length, or to do so for all the chars bar the last one (emitting that char as a literal). It should do this with a probability of 1/N+1 for the Nth replacement in the file. This front-loads the non-determinism, producing an exponential decay in the likelihood of the sub-optimal choice being chosen, and meaning that the deleterious effect on large files is not overly large but small files still get a significant length variation. </p>
<p>This method might also work as a mitigation for CRIME.</p>

Some of them braved the perils of working on the beach to improve the responsiveness of Firefox.</em></p>
<h3>Session Restore</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The plans for Session Restore have been overhauled to make way for code that is more e10s-friendly. Our plans to provide a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=838577\">main thread async API</a> are therefore postponed indefinitely, in favor of a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=894595\">content script implementation of state collection</a>. While less asynchronous than earlier prototypes, this implementation should also provide considerable responsiveness benefits, even before we turn on the e10s switch in Firefox. We have also overhauled part of the implementation of Session Restore to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=867143\">ensure that it caches state whenever appropriate</a>, hence removing most of the jank due to state collection. Finally, we have started working on <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=886447\">compressing communications between the main thread and the worker to minimize serialization costs</a>. Additional clean-up has been completed, with more under way or is waiting for darker skies before landing.</p>
<h3>Places</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The titanic work to refactor Places into a non-blocking, off main thread, efficient API, continues. Ongoing works include making backups non-blocking and reducing the I/O cost of backups. We are also preparing a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=891303\">new asynchronous transaction manager for Places</a>. Once this transaction manager has reached a satisfying state, it might be possible to reuse the code (or at least the design) for projects unrelated to Places.</p>
<h3>Downloads</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The JavaScript downloads API is <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Downloads.jsm\">basically ready</a>. This API is fully asynchronous, JS-friendly and does just about everything off the main thread.</p>
<h3>Misc</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are getting close to having a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=874814\">fully off main thread implementation of mozStorage</a>. <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=891300\">Partial rewrite/cleanup/modularization of OS.File continues</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=895185\">extending</a> and converting code to Promise.jsm. Also, additional work on porting synchronous code to OS.File.</p>
<h3>Side-note</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our work with Async + Responsive has uncovered a number of bugs in the Firefox implementation of Workers and Chrome Workers. This, in itself, is not very surprising, as we are pushing these technologies into a number of places that hadn’t been explored yet. However, the owners of DOM:Workers have been extraordinarily reactive and we would like to thank them. Kudos, guys.</p>

<p>The <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2010/World_Expo\">World Fair</a> gave everyone a chance to share what it was like being a Mozillian from their part of the world and really highlighted how our mission resonates with people everywhere.  </p>
<p>There are a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=world+expo+mozilla+2010&client=firefox-aurora&hs=dDm&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=_SwBUvSlOO3oiALE7IDgAw&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&biw=1308&bih=687\">lot of photos from that</a> but I think the experience was captured best by the <a href=\"https://videos-cdn.mozilla.net/serv/drafts/FFxGlobal.webm\">Mozilla in your language video</a>.  Everyone was set up at tables in a long hall and it made it easy to go down and visit (or photograph or film) people.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://davidwboswell.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/world_expo_2010.jpg\"><img alt=\"world_expo_2010\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3335\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://davidwboswell.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/world_expo_2010.jpg?w=450&h=300\" width=\"450\" /></a></p>
<p>The same setup was used another day for a <a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AuGw_0xKIsJ2dHhsWTVfNDY1VHlJNHlWdUM4Wkp3blE&hl=en&output=html\">Science Fair</a>.  People had a chance to share what they were working on and it was a great demonstration of how Mozilla is a place where people have the opportunity to step up and drive change.</p>
<p>Since Mozilla is so decentralized, the Science Fair helped avoid duplication by surfacing projects and that helped make connections between people with similar interests.  Getting ideas out there also gave people a mandate for moving forward after the Summit.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://davidwboswell.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/science_fair_2010.jpg\"><img alt=\"science_fair_2010\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3343\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://davidwboswell.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/science_fair_2010.jpg?w=450&h=300\" width=\"450\" /></a></p>
<p>I was part of the Science Fair and I definitely left the Summit with a mandate—I had many discussions about a problem I had identified and got validation that other people had the same problem and got useful feedback about how to solve it.</p>
<p>At the time there were <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/community/directory.html\">over 100 Mozilla sites</a>, but no way to navigate between them.  I had a prototype of a <a href=\"http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2010/08/12/a-map-of-the-mozilla-community/\">dynamic map that showed all of the sites connected together</a> as part of a larger whole.  </p>
<p>Everyone who stopped by, even long-time Mozillians, learned something new after they saw the map.  This gave me a lot of momentum to launch the project after the Summit and iterate to make it better (this evolved into the tab at the top of Mozilla sites that connects them all together).</p>
<p><a href=\"http://davidwboswell.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/community_map.png\"><img alt=\"community_map\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2215\" height=\"476\" src=\"http://davidwboswell.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/community_map.png?w=450&h=476\" width=\"450\" /></a></p>
<p>So that’s why I’m excited about the chance to do another World Fair and Science Fair at this year’s Summit.  I’ve offered to help out with that and will be sharing more soon about how you can help if this sounds exciting to you too.</p>

<h3>Local Storage Example</h3>
<p>The user interface and experience is simple and intuitive. It looks and works just like you would expect from this kind of extension. Let's see a quick example that puts some data into the local storage:</p>
<div class=\"dean_ch\" style=\"white-space: wrap;\">localStorage.<span class=\"me1\">setItem</span><span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Father\"</span>, <span class=\"st0\">\"John, 32 years old\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>;<br />
localStorage.<span class=\"me1\">setItem</span><span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Mother\"</span>, <span class=\"st0\">\"Angela, 31 years old\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>;</div>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"194\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firestorageplus/localstorage.png\" title=\"Local Storage Example\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<h3>Modify Data</h3>
<p>You can also easily modify existing data. Just right click on an entry in the panel and pick <em>Edit</em>.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firestorageplus/edit.png\" title=\"Edit data\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<p>As you can see in the context menu there are more actions related to data management. You can also remove existing or create new storage entries.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" height=\"336\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firestorageplus/editdialog.png\" title=\"Edit Dialog\" width=\"376\" /></p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
<p>The <em>FireStorage Plus!</em> panel offers also a few buttons for filtering its content. See extended example that also stores some data into the session storage.</p>
<div class=\"dean_ch\" style=\"white-space: wrap;\"><span class=\"co1\">// Initialize local storage</span><br />
localStorage.<span class=\"me1\">setItem</span><span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Father\"</span>, <span class=\"st0\">\"John, 32 years old\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>;<br />
localStorage.<span class=\"me1\">setItem</span><span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Mother\"</span>, <span class=\"st0\">\"Angela, 31 years old\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>;<p></p>
<p><span class=\"co1\">// Initialize session storage</span><br />
sessionStorage.<span class=\"me1\">Vacation</span> = <span class=\"st0\">\"Bali, middle of August\"</span>;</p></div>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"207\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firestorageplus/localandsession.png\" title=\"Local and Session storage displayed\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Both</em> - display data from both local and session storage</li>
<li><em>localStorage</em> - display data from the local storage only</li>
<li><em>sessionStorage</em> - display data from the session storage only</li>
<li><em>localStorage all scopes</em> - display data from the local storage for all scopes</li>
</ul>
<h3>DOM Panel</h3>
<p>Note, that the (built-in) DOM panel has also basic support for data storage management. It's not that nice and useful especially in case of bigger amount of data, but worth of mentioning.</p>

UPDATED: 1.0.2 adds support for POST search engines. You’ll have to install it manually if you have 1.0, since non approved add-ons don’t get updated automatically.
</p>
<p>
If you’ve been keeping up with the development of Firefox 23, you know that one of the big complaints is the change to keyword search. Starting with Firefox 23, searches in the URL bar will always use the search engine that is set in the search bar. So if you change your search bar to Wikipedia, and then do a search in the URL bar, it will use Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
I’ve built an add-on that allows you to set the keyword search engine separately from the search bar. It can be any search engine you have installed. <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/keyword-search/\">It’s called Keyword Search and it’s available from AMO.</a>
</p>
<p>
Also note that this add-on includes DuckDuckGo as a recommended search engine. If you like the work I do, please consider trying it out and seeing if you like it.

<p>After previous work which went into improving tab animations in Firefox, It’s time to put it into Talos. TART is implemented as an addon which works either stand alone or from within Talos. It measures frames intervals during different animation cases, and it works equally well on mozilla-central and on the UX branch.</p>
<p>TART uses ASAP mode to iterate animation with unlimited frame rate, thus able to expose differences even if under normal conditions it would have been limited to 60Hz.</p>
<p>Joel Maher did most of the talos side of things, and currently the addon awaits review.</p>
<ul>
<li>TART tests animation on 3 main cases:
<ul>
<li>“simple” - open/close of about:blank.</li>
<li>“icon” - open/close of a blank html page with favicon and a long title.</li>
<li>“newtab” - open with and without newtab preload.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“simple” is tested at DPI scaling of 1.0, “icon” at scaling of 1.0 and 2.0, and “newtab” at default scaling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each animation produces 3 result values:
<ul>
<li>“all” - Overall average interval.</li>
<li>“half” - Average interval over 50% of the designated duration - from the end of the animation backwards.</li>
<li>“error” - The difference between the designated duration to the actual one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, “half” is the value which corresponds to the stable part of the animation once it’s hopefully settled. Most tab animations have first frame (or few) which are longer than the rest, so the “all” value, while not meaningless, doesn’t tell the whole story.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some issues which had to be resolved while working on TART:
<ul>
<li>Inactive tabs are throttled, so to get accurate timing (intervals, end event), the test is executed from the Chrome window (rather than from the tab itself).</li>
<li>At DPI scaling of 2.0 at the talos window size, Australis can’t open a second tab without shrinking the first (thus measures animation of more than one tab). Solution: keep the TART tab pinned.</li>
<li>On OS X, “ASAP mode” doesn’t work with OMTC. Solution for now: disable OMTC for TART.</li>
<li>On ASAP mode, mostly on OSX, paints can be starved (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=880036\">bug 880036</a>). Solution: use a temporary pref to prevent this (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=884955\">bug 884955</a>).</li>
<li>At DPI scaling of 2.0, Australis can only have 3 tabs before it starts overflowing the tabstrip (e.g. <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=891450\">bug 891450</a>). This made it very hard to test multi-tab shrink/expand in a comparable fashion on m-c and Australis, and eventually this test was dropped for TART v1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can watch TART at <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=848358\">bug 848358</a>. Other than a review, it also awaits <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=888899\">bug 888899</a> which should enable “ASAP” (stress) mode on OS X as well.</p>
<h3 id=\"absolute-scroll-smoothness-on-windows\">Absolute scroll smoothness on windows</h3>
<p>I was asked by <a href=\"http://taras.glek.net/\">Taras</a> to look into scroll smoothness on windows. Apparently, even after vlad’s great <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=731974\">timing improvement</a>, the timers <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=590422\">filter removal</a> and making vsync on windows <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856427\">work</a>, Firefox still almost never scrolls 100% smoothly on windows.</p>
<p>I did some extensive research into scroll performance of Firefox and other browsers on various platforms, and posted the results at <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=894128\">bug 894128</a>. You’ll also find there a a bookmarklet to test scroll performance on any browser.</p>
<p>One interesting observation is that it’s very hard to programatically detect if the scroll is absolutely smooth. Frame intervals apparently don’t tell the whole story (though they are not meaningless), and neither their standard deviation. To judge if the scroll is 100% smooth, it has to be assessed visually.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some interesting observations from this research:
<ul>
<li>On OS X, even with 50% perf per core (and half the cores as well) compared to a fast Windows system, Firefox scrolls much smoother than on Windows, even with OMTC off.</li>
<li>Firefox may occasionally degrade scroll for several frames for no apparent reason (the content is homogenous). GC/CC?</li>
<li>OMTC typically doubles the throughput on OS X. On windows OMTC is not yet mature enough to test this.</li>
<li>Very low intervals variance is <em>not</em> required for 100% smooth scroll (though IE and Chrome mostly manage very low variance compared to Firefox).</li>
<li>Looks like Chrome and IE use something like APZC during scroll. IE is especially exceptional and is able to practically never drop a frame even on extremely low-end HW (Atom z2760), and also almost never show blanks during scroll.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jet has already shown interest in looking into it. Hopefully some day Firefox will scroll as smooth as it can get…</p>" nil nil "bb0612e41497eb04c6142865578f4459") (493 (20993 4239 703055) "http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2013/08/06/using-json-data-type-in-production-with-socorro/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=using-json-data-type-in-production-with-socorro" "Selena Deckelmann: Using JSON data type in production with Socorro" "selena" "Tue, 06 Aug 2013 14:19:38 +0000" "<p>Back in June, we started using the JSON datatype in production for Mozilla’s <a href=\"http://github.com/mozilla/socorro\">Socorro</a>. Our implementation analyzes crashes from Firefox and other Mozilla products, configured with a HBase backend and Postgres version 9.2 processing and serving reports to middleware and a Django front-end.</p>
<p>The guts of the application that stores raw data into Postgres is implemented in a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/socorro/blob/master/socorro/external/postgresql/crashstorage.py#L106\">crashstorage class</a>, and an example of how we use this field in report generation is in a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/socorro/blob/master/socorro/external/postgresql/raw_sql/procs/update_tcbs.sql#L40\">stored procedure for rolling up our “Top Crashers By Signature” reports</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is to get the metadata we store for each crash into Postgres in its raw JSON form available to SQL queries. We are currently still storing core crash report data in a normalized table (extracted from the original JSON). We are considering re-writing everything to just use a JSON column at the core. There may be some significant negative performance impacts, so more testing is needed before we move forward.</p>
<p>Previously, we only stored metadata in HBase. While it is convenient to have a year’s worth of data in HBase for running arbitrary queries against, once we settle on reports, it is far faster and more convenient to be able to use Postgres with JSON functions and SQL to rollup aggregates. I’m sure this isn’t true for everyone. We’re working with large, but manageable data sets – around 30 GB per week of JSON, and only 2-3 weeks of data at a time.</p>
<p>The advantage to having the JSON in Postgres is that we <strong>no longer are adding columns to our base tables</strong>. It’s not terribly difficult to add columns, but it requires some special work to make the database schema migrations as low-lock as possible on tables with weekly partitions. Cutting out the DBA as an intermediary before developers can deploy new features and reports is a huge win for automation and sustainability of the application.</p>
<p>My preference is that developers never <em>require</em> a DBA to be present when deploying an app — even when there are schema changes. There are lots of features in Postgres that significantly reduce the need for DBA involvement — streaming replication, <code>pg_basebackup</code>, zero downtime column <code>ADD</code>, <code>DROP</code> and <code>ALTER</code>, transactional DDL and <code>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code> to name a few. We’re not quite there for Socorro, but my plan is to get there.</p>
<p>The ideal role of the Postgres DBA is more to write database code, monitor and improve performance. That kind of role feels a lot more like a partner to developers, rather than a separate, mysterious entity. In much the same way that DevOps and configuration management enable great cooperation between IT and developers, many of Postgres’ maintenance features enable greater cooperation and less friction between DBAs and developers deploying new features.</p>
<p>There are still a few configuration and initialization issues to work through before Postgres can be seen as completely past it’s reputation as a difficult to deploy database. Some of that can be solved with more widely used configuration recipes for tools like Puppet and Chef. My colleagues in IT have been working on a Puppet module that they plan to release that automatically sets up a master database and as many replicas as you’d like to configure.</p>
<p>My hope is that people more widely share their automation stories and code!</p>
<p>In anycase, the JSON datatype is solving an important problem for our team, and significantly reducing the demand for schema changes. I’d love to hear more reports from users trying out JSON the field.</p>" nil nil "6b63a0c1a89d730fec40346069db3489") (492 (20993 4239 700687) "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/SoftwareIsHardPlanetMozilla/~3/fpwctoF2tr0/" "Jan Odvarko: Firebug Extension: FireStorage Plus! =?utf-8?Q?=E2=80=93?= Manage web storage" "Honza" "Tue, 06 Aug 2013 14:08:47 +0000" "<p>Another Firebug extension we have tested with upcoming Firebug 1.12 (will be available in several weeks) allows managing web storage directly in your Firebug.<br />
 <br />
<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firestorage-plus/\">FireStorage Plus!</a> appends an extra Firebug tab which lets you inspect and modify the local and session storage.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"229\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firestorageplus/firestorageplus.png\" title=\"FireStorage Plus!\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<p><span id=\"more-785\"></span></p>
<h3>Local Storage Example</h3>
<p>The user interface and experience is simple and intuitive. It looks and works just like you would expect from this kind of extension. Let's see a quick example that puts some data into the local storage:</p>
<div class=\"dean_ch\" style=\"white-space: wrap;\">localStorage.<span class=\"me1\">setItem</span><span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Father\"</span>, <span class=\"st0\">\"John, 32 years old\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>;<br />
localStorage.<span class=\"me1\">setItem</span><span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Mother\"</span>, <span class=\"st0\">\"Angela, 31 years old\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>;</div>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"194\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firestorageplus/localstorage.png\" title=\"Local Storage Example\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<h3>Modify Data</h3>
<p>You can also easily modify existing data. Just right click on an entry in the panel and pick <em>Edit</em>.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firestorageplus/edit.png\" title=\"Edit data\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<p>As you can see in the context menu there are more actions related to data management. You can also remove existing or create new storage entries.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" height=\"336\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firestorageplus/editdialog.png\" title=\"Edit Dialog\" width=\"376\" /></p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
<p>The <em>FireStorage Plus!</em> panel offers also a few buttons for filtering its content. See extended example that also stores some data into the session storage.</p>
<div class=\"dean_ch\" style=\"white-space: wrap;\"><span class=\"co1\">// Initialize local storage</span><br />
localStorage.<span class=\"me1\">setItem</span><span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Father\"</span>, <span class=\"st0\">\"John, 32 years old\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>;<br />
localStorage.<span class=\"me1\">setItem</span><span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Mother\"</span>, <span class=\"st0\">\"Angela, 31 years old\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>;<p></p>
<p><span class=\"co1\">// Initialize session storage</span><br />
sessionStorage.<span class=\"me1\">Vacation</span> = <span class=\"st0\">\"Bali, middle of August\"</span>;</p></div>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"207\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firestorageplus/localandsession.png\" title=\"Local and Session storage displayed\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Both</em> - display data from both local and session storage</li>
<li><em>localStorage</em> - display data from the local storage only</li>
<li><em>sessionStorage</em> - display data from the session storage only</li>
<li><em>localStorage</em> - display data from the local storage for all scopes</li>
</ul>
<h3>DOM Panel</h3>
<p>Note, that the (built-in) DOM panel has also basic support for data storage management. It's not that nice and useful especially in case of bigger amount of data, but worth of mentioning.</p>

<p>I’m reimplementing some expensive database queries, moving them from our middleware into materialized view tables. We make pretty extensive use of <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/queries-with.html\">Common Table Expressions</a> (CTEs). And we generate many reporting queries that calculate averages and percentages of a total. One way this could be done is with a <code>CROSS JOIN</code>, which is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product\">cartesian product</a> of two tables, adding the total and then the percentage calculation to our original table that produces counts of events. For information about <code>JOIN</code> types supported by PostgreSQL, see <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM\">SELECT…FROM documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Or we could use <code>OVER()</code>, one of several <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/tutorial-window.html\">Window Functions</a> supported by Postgres. From the Postgres documentation, Window Functions are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row — the rows retain their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few other folks have written about Window Functions: <a href=\"http://postgresguide.com/tips/window.html\">Postgres Guide to Window Functions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.openlogic.com/wazi/bid/188074/Window-Functions-PostgreSQL-s-Best-Kept-Secret\">Window Functions: Postgres’s best kept secret</a>, <a href=\"http://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/sql-window-functions\">SQL Window Functions</a> (examples in Ruby). “All built-in and user-defined aggregate functions — such as count, max, bit_or, or xmlagg” — are available for computation as a window function, <a href=\"http://www.openlogic.com/wazi/bid/188074/Window-Functions-PostgreSQL-s-Best-Kept-Secret\">quoting Open Logic</a>, who phrased it well.</p>
<p>If you read about <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-expressions.html#SYNTAX-WINDOW-FUNCTIONS\">OVER()</a>, you’ll see that all the examples specify a <code>PARTITION</code> clause. But you don’t have to specify a <code>PARTITION</code> to take advantage of the feature.</p>
<p>We had a query containing two CTEs and a final <code>SELECT</code> that produced the matview data. Here’s an example of that query:</p>
<pre><code>WITH crashes as (
SELECT
product_name as category
, version_string
, SUM(report_count) as report_count
FROM signature_summary_products
JOIN signatures USING (signature_id)
WHERE signatures.signature = 'libflashplayer.so@0x1f2a14'
AND report_date >= now()::date - '15 day'::interval
AND report_date < now()::date
GROUP BY product_name, version_string
),
totals as (
SELECT
category
, version_string
, report_count
, SUM(report_count) OVER () as total_count
FROM crashes
)
SELECT category
, version_string
, report_count
, round((report_count * 100::numeric)/total_count,3)::TEXT
as percentage
FROM totals
ORDER BY report_count DESC;
</code></pre>
<p>The part under consideration is:</p>
<pre><code>    , SUM(report_count) OVER () as total_count
</code></pre>
<p>So, you see that <code>OVER()</code> has no <code>PARTITION</code> defined, meaning that the SUM will be calculated over the entire result.</p>
<p>Here is that same query, implemented using <code>SUM()</code> and a <code>CROSS JOIN</code>:</p>
<pre><code>WITH crashes as (
SELECT
product_name as category
, version_string
, SUM(report_count) as report_count
FROM signature_summary_products
JOIN signatures USING (signature_id)
WHERE signatures.signature = 'libflashplayer.so@0x1f2a14'
AND report_date >= now()::date - '15 day'::interval
AND report_date < now()::date
GROUP BY product_name, version_string
),
totals as (
SELECT
SUM(report_count) AS total_count
FROM crashes
)
SELECT category
, version_string
, report_count
, round((report_count * 100::numeric)/total_count,3)::TEXT
as percentage
FROM crashes CROSS JOIN totals
ORDER BY report_count DESC;
</code></pre>
<p>What’s the difference to Postgres between that and a <code>SUM()</code> plus a <code>CROSS JOIN</code>?</p>
<p>Here’s the <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/using-explain.html\">EXPLAIN</a> output from this query, pared down to the relevant section:</p>
<pre><code>   CTE totals
->  WindowAgg  (cost=0.00..0.03 rows=1 width=72) (actual time=0.112..0.114 rows=3 loops=1)
->  CTE Scan on crashes  (cost=0.00..0.02 rows=1 width=72) (actual time=0.097..0.100 rows=3 loops=1)
->  CTE Scan on totals  (cost=0.00..0.04 rows=1 width=104) (actual time=0.121..0.129 rows=3 loops=1)
</code></pre>
<p>The important bit to have a look at is <strong>WindowAgg</strong> right after <strong>CTE totals</strong>.</p>
<p>Now compare to the EXPLAIN output from a <code>SUM()</code> plus a <code>CROSS JOIN</code> query:</p>
<pre><code>   CTE totals
->  Aggregate  (cost=0.02..0.03 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.015..0.015 rows=1 loops=1)
->  CTE Scan on crashes  (cost=0.00..0.02 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.001..0.004 rows=3 loops=1)
->  Nested Loop  (cost=0.00..0.07 rows=1 width=104) (actual time=0.191..0.205 rows=3 loops=1)
->  CTE Scan on crashes  (cost=0.00..0.02 rows=1 width=72) (actual time=0.162..0.164 rows=3 loops=1)
->  CTE Scan on totals  (cost=0.00..0.02 rows=1 width=32) (actual time=0.006..0.006 rows=1 loops=3)
</code></pre>
<p>You can see here that we now have an <strong>Aggregate</strong> (for the <code>SUM()</code>) plus a <strong>Nested Loop</strong> (for the <code>CROSS JOIN</code>). This example query only has three results returned, but our more typical queries involve 10k or more rows returned.</p>
<p>Avoiding the Aggregate and Nested Loop will save us lots of memory and processing time on every run of a very expensive query.</p>" nil nil "bfdb4491413d9c6e64a8ec46be492fee") (490 (20992 64915 830330) "http://robcee.net/2013/pinchy/" "Rob Campbell: Pinchy Rediscovered" "rob" "Tue, 06 Aug 2013 12:30:40 +0000" "<p>I had a funny moment this morning.

If you’ve been keeping up with the development of Firefox 23, you know that one of the big complaints is the change to keyword search. Starting with Firefox 23, searches in the URL bar will always use the search engine that is set in the search bar. So if you change your search bar to Wikipedia, and then do a search in the URL bar, it will use Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
I’ve built an add-on that allows you to set the keyword search engine separately from the search bar. It can be any search engine you have installed. <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/keyword-search/\">It’s called Keyword Search and it’s available from AMO.</a>
</p>
<p>
Also note that this add-on includes DuckDuckGo as a recommended search engine. If you like the work I do, please consider trying it out and seeing if you like it.

<p>By using the approach mentioned in Vlad’s post we can target Visual Studio directly instead of a build system like Ninja. This gives Visual Studio the correct build flags for each file allowing features like IntelliSense and building from Visual Studio using MSBuild to work perfectly. I’m generating a project per shared library and a Visual Studio solution to group the results together. The results are quite neat because it shows at a glance which sources files are included in each library. Any files listed in the visual studio project are safe to edit which should cover the common developer workflow of editing cpp/headers and recompiling. Other rarer changes for platform developers like adding a new file and tweaking build settings should be done by closing visual studio, doing a local change and rebuilding with the mozilla build system and re-openning the updated Visual Studio Solution.</p>

<p>By using the approach mentioned in Vlad’s post we can target Visual Studio directly instead of a build system like Ninja. This gives Visual Studio the correct build flags for each file allowing features like IntelliSense and building from Visual Studio using MSBuild to work perfectly. I’m generating a project per shared library and a Visual Studio solution to group the results together. The results are quite neat because it shows at a glance which sources files are included in each library. Any files listed in the visual studio project are safe to edit which should cover the common developer workflow of editing cpp/headers and recompiling. Other rarer changes for platform developers like adding a new file and tweaking build settings should be done by closing visual studio, doing a local change and rebuilding with the mozilla build system and re-openning the updated Visual Studio Solution.</p>

<p>This isn’t ready for general use yet because we still don’t generate the Link step properly and handle some corner cases in XUL yet but simpler libraries like gkmedias.dll is already working well. Supporting XUL should only require a few days of work. Once this is fixed we can move to supporting advanced Visual Studio features like “Edit and Continue” and distributed compiling.</p>

This post describes how CSS transforms fit into the world of coordinate systems I described there.
<br />
<br />But first, a quick status update: since I wrote that post, a fair amount of code has been converted to use the new typed classes (CSSPoint, LayoutDevicePoint, etc.). Special thanks to Ms2ger who has been incrementally converting various bits of layout code to use these where appropriate. The conversion has turned up some type mismatches and flushed out bugs on B2G, Fennec, and recently even Metro.
<br />
<br />And now, on to the main event: CSS transforms. CSS transforms make things complicated because they are not really applied in layout code, but saved as a transform on the layer and applied at composition time. (Recall that the layer can be thought of as the rendered texture that gets uploaded to the graphics hardware). From a quick reading of the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/\">CSS transforms spec</a> this makes sense, because the transforms are not meant to affect the layout properties of elements. However it complicates coordinate system work because a \"transform: scale(2)\" CSS style, for instance, doesn't change the size of the element in LayoutDevicePixels but does affect the ScreenPixel size.
<br />
<br />If you recall from part 1, I defined LayoutDevicePixels as taking into account the device DPI and full zoom amounts; they're basically the coordinate system that the layout code outputs positioning data in. If there is an element with a 2x scale CSS transform applied, then the ScreenPixel height of the element must be twice the LayoutDevicePixel height of the element (for the moment let us ignore any OMTC transforms and resolution changes that might also be applied). However, there are no restrictions on the size of the layer, which means the LayerPixel that sits in between the LayoutDevicePixel and ScreenPixel can be anything.
<br />
<br />So, we could, for example, have the layer be the same size as the untransformed element (1 LayoutDevicePixel == 1 LayerPixel) and then do the entire 2x scale in hardware (1 LayerPixel == 2 ScreenPixels). Or we could do something like have gecko render at higher density (1 LayoutDevicePixel == 2 LayerPixels) and then not scale it in hardware (1 LayerPixel == 1 ScreenPixel). We could even render it 4x in gecko and then scale it down in hardware by 2x, if we wanted. Rendering it small in gecko and scaling it up in hardware results in a blurry image, and rendering it large in gecko and scaling it down in hardware is a waste of memory/CPU. In theory, the scaling that results in the best visual effect without wasting resources is to have no hardware scaling and have gecko render exactly at the specified CSS transform. However, in practice, we use <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/ff6bb97c0c74/layout/base/FrameLayerBuilder.cpp#l2694\">some heuristics</a> to figure out the best tradeoff here because the CSS transform can change over time.
<br />
<br />And while we're on the subject, a similar thing actually happens with the OMTC transform. If take a regular page and pinch-zoom it to 2x, what actually happens on the layout side is that the presShell resolution is set to 2x, the CSS transform on the page is <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/ff6bb97c0c74/layout/base/nsDisplayList.cpp#l1141\">updated to be 0.5x</a>, and the OMTC transform is again 2x. So the net effect is that the page is scaled up by 2x, with 1 LayoutDevicePixel == 2 LayerPixels == 2 ScreenPixels, but the fact that the CSS transform on the layer is modified is important from an implementation point of view.
<br />
<br />Ok, so that's all well and good, and gives us nice-looking CSS transforms efficiently, at the expense of some complicated coordinate transforms. Now we can flesh out our summary from last time to be a little more precise:
<br />
<br />CSSPixel x widget scale x full zoom = LayoutDevicePixel
<br />LayoutDevicePixel x CSS-driven resolution x OMTC-driven resolution = LayerPixel
<br />LayerPixel x CSS transforms x OMTC transforms = ScreenPixel
<br />
<br />But that's not all. Note that CSS transforms apply to elements in the DOM rather than the entire document. This means that different layers in the layer tree can have different transforms, and these transforms accumulate when mapping a particular layer up to the screen. Madness! That means there's no longer just one set of LayerPixels but many! And with the work that I've been doing to make subframes asynchronously scrollable, many of the layers can have their own individual OMTC-driven resolutions and OMTC transforms as well! More madness! (In practice only top-level layers for PresShells will have OMTC resolutions but I wouldn't count on that always remaining the case.)
<br />
<br />So to update the summary again, I need to introduce some layers. Assume that layer L is some random layer in the tree, it has a parent layer M, grandparent layer N, and so on up until the root layer R. Then:
<br />
<br />CSSPixel x widget scale x full zoom = LayoutDevicePixel
<br />LayoutDevicePixel x CSS-driven resolution (for R) x OMTC-driven resolution (for R) = LayerPixel (for R)
<br />LayerPixel (for R) x CSS-driven resolution (for Q) x OMTC-driven resolution (for Q) = LayerPixel (for Q)
<br />LayerPixel (for Q) x CSS-driven resolution (for P) x OMTC-driven resolution (for P) = LayerPixel (for P)
<br />...
<br />LayerPixel (for M) x CSS-driven resolution (for L) x OMTC-driven resolution (for L) = LayerPixel (for L)
<br />LayerPixel (for L) x CSS transform (for L) x OMTC transform (for L) x CSS transform (for M) x OMTC transform (for M) x ... x CSS transform (for R) x OMTC transform (for R) = ScreenPixel
<br />
<br />Simple, right? :) If I get around to it, the next post will cover how input events are mapped back from screen space to layout space. (It's not as straightforward as you might think.)

<p>I’m reimplementing some expensive database queries, moving them from our middleware into materialized view tables. We make pretty extensive use of <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/queries-with.html\">Common Table Expressions</a> (CTEs). And we generate many reporting queries that calculate averages and percentages of a total. One way this could be done is with a CROSS JOIN, which is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product\">cartesian product</a> of two tables, adding the total and then the percentage calculation to our original table that produces counts of events. For information about JOIN types supported by PostgreSQL, see <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM\">SELECT…FROM documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Or we could use OVER(), one of several <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/tutorial-window.html\">Window Functions</a> supported by Postgres. From the Postgres documentation, Window Functions are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row — the rows retain their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few other folks have written about Window Functions: <a href=\"http://postgresguide.com/tips/window.html\">Postgres Guide to Window Functions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.openlogic.com/wazi/bid/188074/Window-Functions-PostgreSQL-s-Best-Kept-Secret\">Window Functions: Postgres’s best kept secret</a>, <a href=\"http://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/sql-window-functions\">SQL Window Functions</a> (examples in Ruby). “All built-in and user-defined aggregate functions — such as count, max, bit_or, or xmlagg” — are available for computation as a window function, <a href=\"http://www.openlogic.com/wazi/bid/188074/Window-Functions-PostgreSQL-s-Best-Kept-Secret\">quoting Open Logic</a>, who phrased it well.</p>
<p>If you read about <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-expressions.html#SYNTAX-WINDOW-FUNCTIONS\">OVER()</a>, you’ll see that all the examples specify a PARTITION clause. But you don’t have to specify a PARTITION to take advantage of the feature.</p>
<p>We had a query containing two CTEs and a final SELECT that produced the matview data. Here’s an example of that query:</p>
<pre><code>WITH crashes as (
SELECT
product_name as category
, version_string
, SUM(report_count) as report_count
FROM signature_summary_products
JOIN signatures USING (signature_id)
WHERE signatures.signature = 'libflashplayer.so@0x1f2a14'
AND report_date >= now()::date - '15 day'::interval
AND report_date < now()::date
GROUP BY product_name, version_string
),
totals as (
SELECT
category
, version_string
, report_count
, SUM(report_count) OVER () as total_count
FROM crashes
)
SELECT category
, version_string
, report_count
, round((report_count * 100::numeric)/total_count,3)::TEXT
as percentage
FROM totals
ORDER BY report_count DESC;
</code></pre>
<p>The part under consideration is:</p>
<pre><code>    , SUM(report_count) OVER () as total_count
</code></pre>
<p>So, you see that OVER has no PARTITION defined, meaning that the SUM will be calculated over the entire result. So, what’s the difference to Postgres between that and a SUM() plus a CROSS JOIN?</p>
<p>Here’s the <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/using-explain.html\">EXPLAIN</a> output from this query, pared down to the relevant section:</p>
<pre><code>   CTE totals
->  WindowAgg  (cost=0.00..0.03 rows=1 width=72) (actual time=0.112..0.114 rows=3 loops=1)
->  CTE Scan on crashes  (cost=0.00..0.02 rows=1 width=72) (actual time=0.097..0.100 rows=3 loops=1)
->  CTE Scan on totals  (cost=0.00..0.04 rows=1 width=104) (actual time=0.121..0.129 rows=3 loops=1)
</code></pre>
<p>The important bit to have a look at is <strong>WindowAgg</strong> right after <strong>CTE totals</strong>.</p>
<p>Now compare to the EXPLAIN output from a SUM() plus a CROSS JOIN query:</p>
<pre><code>   CTE totals
->  Aggregate  (cost=0.02..0.03 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.015..0.015 rows=1 loops=1)
->  CTE Scan on crashes  (cost=0.00..0.02 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.001..0.004 rows=3 loops=1)
->  Nested Loop  (cost=0.00..0.07 rows=1 width=104) (actual time=0.191..0.205 rows=3 loops=1)
->  CTE Scan on crashes  (cost=0.00..0.02 rows=1 width=72) (actual time=0.162..0.164 rows=3 loops=1)
->  CTE Scan on totals  (cost=0.00..0.02 rows=1 width=32) (actual time=0.006..0.006 rows=1 loops=3)
</code></pre>
<p>You can see here that we now have an Aggregate (for the SUM()) plus a Nested Loop (for the CROSS JOIN). This query only has three results returned, but our more typical queries involve 10k or more rows returned. Avoiding the Aggregate and Nested Loop will save us lots of memory and processing time on every run of a very expensive query.</p>" nil nil "00f68d138ca362053e716ea4a14e57e5") (482 (20992 43973 734462) "http://whereswalden.com/2013/08/05/new-in-firefox-23-the-length-property-of-an-array-can-be-made-non-writable-but-you-shouldnt-do-it/" "Jeff Walden: New in Firefox 23: the length property of an array can be made non-writable (but you =?utf-8?Q?shouldn=E2=80=99t?= do it)" "Jeff" "Mon, 05 Aug 2013 23:05:12 +0000" "<h3>Properties and their attributes</h3>
<p>Properties of JavaScript objects include attributes for <em>enumerability</em> (whether the property shows up in a <code>for-in</code> loop on the object) and <em>configurability</em> (whether the property can be deleted or changed in certain ways).  Getter/setter properties also include <em>get</em> and <em>set</em> attributes storing those functions, and value properties include attributes for <em>writability</em> and <em>value</em>.</p>
<h3>Array properties’ attributes</h3>
<p>Arrays are objects; array properties are structurally identical to properties of all other objects.  But arrays have long-standing, unusual behavior concerning their elements and their lengths.  These oddities cause array properties to <em>look</em> like other properties but <em>behave</em> quite differently.</p>
<h4>The <code>length</code> property</h4>
<p>The <code>length</code> property of an array looks like a data property but when set acts like an accessor property.</p>
<pre class=\"code\">var arr = [0, 1, 2, 3];
var desc = <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptor\">Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor</a>(arr, \"length\");
print(desc.value); // 4
print(desc.writable); // true
print(\"get\" in desc); // false
print(\"set\" in desc); // false
print(\"0\" in arr); // true
arr.length = 0;
print(\"0\" in arr); // false (!)
</pre>
<p>In <abbr title=\"ECMAScript, 5th edition\">ES5</abbr> terms, the <code>length</code> property <em>is</em> a data property.  But arrays have a special <code>[[DefineOwnProperty]]</code> hook, invoked whenever a property is added, set, or modified, that imposes special behavior on array length changes.</p>
<h4>The element properties of arrays</h4>
<p>Arrays’ <code>[[DefineOwnProperty]]</code> also imposes special behavior on array elements.  Array elements also look like data properties, but if you add an element beyond the length, it’s as if a setter were called — the length grows to accommodate the element.</p>
<pre class=\"code\">var arr = [0, 1, 2, 3];
var desc = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(arr, \"0\");
print(desc.value); // 0
print(desc.writable); // true
print(\"get\" in desc); // false
print(\"set\" in desc); // false
print(arr.length); // 4
arr[7] = 0;
print(arr.length); // 8 (!)
</pre>
<p>Arrays are unlike any other objects, and so JS array implementations are highly customized.  These customizations allow the length and elements to act as specified when modified.  They also make array element access about as fast as array element accesses in languages like C++.</p>
<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty\"><code>Object.defineProperty</code></a> implementations and arrays</h3>
<p>Customized array representations complicate <code>Object.defineProperty</code>.  Defining array elements isn’t a problem, as increasing the length for added elements is long-standing behavior.  But defining array length is problematic: if the length can be made non-writable, every place that modifies array elements must respect that.</p>
<p>Most engines’ initial <code>Object.defineProperty</code> implementations didn’t correctly support redefining array lengths.  Providing a usable implementation for non-array objects was top priority; array support was secondary.  SpiderMonkey’s initial <code>Object.defineProperty</code> implementation threw a <code>TypeError</code> when redefining length, stating this was “not currently supported”.  Fully-correct behavior required changes to our object representation.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Brian Hackett’s work in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=827490\">bug 827490</a> changed our object representation enough to implement length redefinition.  I fixed <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=858381\">bug 858381</a> in April to make <code>Object.defineProperty</code> work for array lengths.  Those changes will be in Firefox 23 tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Should you make array lengths non-writable?</h3>
<p>You can change an array’s length without redefining it, so the only new capability is making an array length non-writable.  Compatibility aside, <em>should</em> you make array lengths non-writable?  I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Non-writable array length forbids certain operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t change the length.</li>
<li>You can’t add an element past that length.</li>
<li>You can’t call methods that increase (<abbr lang=\"la\" title=\"exempli gratia, for example\">e.g.</abbr> <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push\"><code>Array.prototype.push</code></a>) or decrease (e.g. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop\"><code>Array.prototype.pop</code></a>) the length.  (These methods <em>do</em> sometimes modify the array, in well-specified ways that <em>don’t</em> change the length, before throwing.)</li>
</ul>
<p>But these are purely <em>restrictions</em>.  Any operation that succeeds on an array with non-writable length, succeeds on the same array with writable length.  You wouldn’t do any of these things anyway, to an array whose length you’re treating as fixed.  So why mark it non-writable at all?  There’s no functionality-based reason for good code to have non-writable array lengths.</p>
<p>Fixed-length arrays’ only value is in <em>maybe</em> permitting optimizations dependent on immutable length.  Making length immutable permits minimizing array elements’ memory use.  (Arrays usually over-allocate memory to avoid <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code> behavior when repeatedly extending the array.)  But if it saves memory (this is highly allocator-sensitive), it won’t save much.  Fixed-length arrays may permit bounds-check elimination in very circumscribed situations.  But these are micro-optimizations you’d be hard-pressed to notice in practice.</p>
<p>In conclusion: I don’t think you should use non-writable array lengths.  They’re required by ES5, so we’ll support them.  But there’s no good reason to use them.</p>" nil nil "e8ac4f27acdb5b59f690344e4ef99a87") (481 (20992 43973 733379) "http://oduinn.com/blog/2013/08/05/infrastructure-load-for-july-2013/" "John O'Duinn: Infrastructure load for July 2013" "John" "Mon, 05 Aug 2013 19:05:13 +0000" "<ul>

<a href=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_07_trend.png\"><img align=\"center\" alt=\"Overall load since Jan 2009\" src=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_07_trend.png\" width=\"440\" /></a> <p></p>
</li><li><strong>#checkins-per-day:</strong> We had <strong>370 checkins</strong> checkins on 02jun. During July, 20-of-31 days had over 200 checkins-per-day, 18-of-31 days had over 250 checkins-per-day. Of note, 10-of-31 days had over 300 checkins-per-day – a huge jump in load.
</li><li><strong>#checkins-per-hour:</strong> Checkins are still mostly mid-day PT/afternoon ET. For 10 of every 24 hours, we sustained over 10 checkins per hour. Heaviest load time this month was 1pm-2pm PT (14.7 checkins-per-hour) – a new record.
</li>
<p>As usual, our build pool handled the load well, with >95% of all builds consistently being started within 15mins. The use of multiple inbounds is really helping improve bottlenecks. Our test pool continues to improve. All the hard work by RelEng, ATeam and IT is paying off, we’re seeing more test jobs being handled with better response times. The work on fixing/disabling any tests that are hidden-yet-still-being-run is also improving our test situation. The peak for July was 55,983 test jobs on 18jul. Still more work to be done here, but very encouraging. </p>
<p>As always, if you know of any test suites that no longer need to be run per-checkin, please let us know so we can immediately reduce the load a little. Also, if you know of any test suites which are perma-orange, and hidden on tbpl.m.o, please let us know – thats the worst of both worlds – using up scarce CPU time and not being displayed for people to make use of. We’ll make sure to file bugs to get tests fixed – or disabled – every little bit helps put scarce test CPU to better use.

<p><strong>mozilla-inbound, birch/b2g-inbound, fx-team:</strong><br />
mozilla-inbound continues to be heavily used as an integration branch. Its noteworthy that as developers start to use other -inbound branches, we saw mozilla-inbound reduce significantly to 21.3% of all checkins. Its still consistently far more then all other integration branches combined, but you can see the congestion reduced as people use other *-inbound branches. </p>
<p>The “birch as b2g-inbound” experiment is officially a great success, with 7.9% of this month’s checkins landing here, birch has now become the 3rd busiest branch (after try, and mozilla-inbound). Birch is also helping reduce pain of any mozilla-inbound closures, and further proving the lure of sheriff-assisted-landings to developers. As of 01aug, the official “b2g-inbound” branch is officially open, on a permanent basis, to use instead of birch. I expect the percentage on this branch to stabilize in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The fx-team branch increased slightly to 2.4% of checkins this month, as sheriffs coverage started late in the month. I expect the percentage on this branch to grow over August, as more people rely on sheriff support here.</p>
<p>The combined total of these 3 integration branches is 31.6%, showing just how much our sheriffs are helping.</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>mozilla-aurora, mozilla-beta, mozilla-b2g18, gaia-central:</strong><br />
Of our total monthly checkins:</p>
<ul>
<li> 1.8% landed into mozilla-central, slightly lower than last month. As usual, very few people land directly on mozilla-central these days, when there are sheriff-assisted branches available instead.
</li><li> 2.1% landed into mozilla-aurora, slightly higher than last month.
</li><li> 1.1% landed into mozilla-beta, slightly higher than last month.
</li><li> 1.2% landed into mozilla-b2g18, slightly lower then last month.
</li><li> Note: gaia-central, and all other gaia-* branches, are not counted here anymore. For details, see <a href=\"http://oduinn.com/blog/2013/07/25/infrastructure-load-for-june-2013/\">here</a>.

<p><strong>misc other details:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Pushes per day</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can clearly see weekends through the month. Its worth noting that we had >200 checkins-per-day almost every working day in July. This has been true for a few months now, so it is starting to feel like 200 checkins-per-day is the new “normal” for a working day at Mozilla. Having 10-of-31 days over 300 checkins-per-day is a big deal. <a href=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_07_pushes.png\"><img alt=\"#Pushes this month\" src=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_07_pushes.png\" width=\"400\"\" /></a>
</li><li><strong>Pushes by hour of day</strong>
<ul>
Mid-day PT is consistently the biggest volume of checkins, specifically between 1pm-2pm PT, with 14.77 checkins-per-hour, and 2pm-3pm PT, with 12.63 checkins-per-hour. Its interesting to see load spreading out across the day, with 10-of-every-24 hours sustaining over 10 checkins per hour. Heaviest load time this month was 1pm-2pm PT (14.7 checkins-per-hour) – a new record.

Over time, developers learn tricks (<em>“If I change file X, I have to rebuild in foo/, bar/, toolkit/library/”</em>), but this is error prone.  New developers also don’t have any of that knowledge, and they’re struggling with a lot of new things that having the build system slow down their learning hurts significantly.</p>
<p>Ehsan and BenWa had an idea for how to make this better.  The core idea was to just annotate the relevant build rules to spit out specific rules for each target and their inputs, thereby generating an alternate, faster, non-recursive build system as part of the first build.  Others have had this idea before, but usually only for testing or gathering some data.  BenWa did a first prototype, generating makefile fragments that could be included together.  I did some hacking to create a little python script for the fragment generation, which let us start experimenting with generating <a href=\"http://martine.github.io/ninja/\">ninja files</a> instead of using make – for what we were doing, <a href=\"http://martine.github.io/ninja/manual.html#_design_goals\">ninja is perfect</a>, since its purpose is to execute “generated build systems”.</p>
<p>BenWa is working on extending it to generate project files for some IDEs.  Since we have the full dependency graph, we can also do parallel builds with 100% cpu utilization, and can significantly distribute builds as well with little overhead.</p>
<p>Here’s the main result that you’re probably wondering about, all on my Windows 7, quad-core 4th Gen Core i7 (8 threads), 7200 RPM hard drive, 16GB memory desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean tree
<ul>
<li>top level pymake (-s -j8)
<ul>
<li>490 seconds (8 minutes, 10 seconds)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>top level ninja
<ul>
<li><strong>1.46 <em>seconds</em> </strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Touch a deep inner source (gfxGDIShaper.cpp – requires libxul relink)
<ul>
<li>top level pymake (-s -j8)
<ul>
<li>544 seconds (9 minutes, 4 seconds)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was going to make a chart, but it would have needed a logarithmic axis.</p>
<p>These commands of course don’t do the same thing; running make will redo the export step as well as recurse into a bunch of other targets that are never seen by hacky.mk.  But the <em>result</em> is the same for most developers, and the time savings is significant.  These numbers are also a good target for other more comprehensive build system work; the results above are purely bound my compiler and linker speed (and IO; I need to retry this on a SSD – and also wrapper scripts for python, executing bash, etc.  There’s a bit of room for improvement!).  It would be very difficult to end up with faster builds than the above, given equivalent parallelization.</p>
<h3>How to use it</h3>
<ol>
<li>Clone hacky.mk from github: <a href=\"http://github.com/bgirard/hacky.mk\">http://github.com/bgirard/hacky.mk</a>.  Then run <code>./hackify ../path/to/mozilla-central</code>.  It’ll patch rules.mk and copy some files into place (alternatively, you can patch by hand symlink the hackymake dir from the repo as build/tools/hackymake and js/src/build/tools/hackymake).</li>
<li>Do a normal build.  You’ll want to do a full build into a brand new objdir.</li>
<li>While that’s going, clone <a href=\"http://github.com/martine/ninja.git\">http://github.com/martine/ninja.git</a> and build it.  Copy the binary somewhere in your PATH.</li>
<li>When the Firefox build is done, run <code>$srcdir/tools/hackymake/reninja</code></li>
<li>To build, run <code>ninja</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>What it can do:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rebuild objects from C/C++ sources (for JS, libxul, and friends)</li>
<li>Rebuild libraries</li>
<li>On Windows, copy exported include files into your objdir’s dist/include dir if the original changes (since we can’t use symlinks on Windows)
** caveat: not JS, yet; JS has its own export rules that aren’t hooked up yet</li>
</ul>
<h3>What it can’t do:</h3>
<p>Basically, anything not listed above.</p>
<p>It doesn’t do anything outside of (mostly) libxul or JS deps.  It doesn’t know anything about any of the external build systems (e.g. nspr).</p>
<p>It doesn’t know how to build binaries (e.g. firefox.exe, the js shell).  It also doesn’t know how to regenerate headers from IDL files, or IPC stubs from ipdl files.  None of that would be very hard to add, it just wasn’t a top priority.</p>
<p>It can’t handle additions or removals of source files, at least not automatically.  If you just run a regular “make” in the directory where the source file was added and you rerun reninja, that should be enough.  Removals are harder; manually remove the relevant file from <code>$objdir/.hacky</code> and run reninja.</p>
<p>It can’t handle changes to the build configuration.  Build configuration changes are unlikely to be ever handled; they’ll require a rebuild using the regular build system first.</p>
<h3>Next steps, how can you help?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use it, tell others about it</li>
<li>Provide feedback; <a href=\"https://github.com/bgirard/hacky.mk/issues\">Github issues</a> work fine for this</li>
<li>We’ll work to get it into the tree</li>
<li>Add support for additional rules (binaries, idl/ipdl generators, etc!)</li>

In his multi-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson, Jefferson and His Time, Dumas Malone tells the story of how Jefferson handled the first meeting held to decide the organization of the future University of Virginia. The University had been Jefferson’s idea in the first place, but (as is the case everywhere, not just in open source projects) many other parties had climbed on board quickly, each with their own interests and agendas. When they gathered at that first meeting to hash things out, Jefferson made sure to show up with meticulously prepared architectural drawings, detailed budgets for construction and operation, a proposed curriculum, and the names of specific faculty he wanted to import from Europe. No one else in the room was even remotely as prepared; the group essentially had to capitulate to Jefferson’s vision, and the University was eventually founded more or less in accordance with his plans. The facts that construction went far over budget, and that many of his ideas did not, for various reasons, work out in the end, were all things Jefferson probably knew perfectly well would happen. His purpose was strategic: to show up at the meeting with something so substantive that everyone else would have to fall into the role of simply proposing modifications to it, so that the overall shape, and therefore schedule, of the project would be roughly as he wanted.

<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bilalghalib\">Bilal Ghalib</a> introduced me to a Hackerspace founder from Beirut, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RajaOueis\">Raja Oueis</a>, just before they were scheduled to talk about <a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/289.html\">Hackerspaces and creativity in conflict zones</a>. As they fiddled around with Bilal's slides, I talked to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarasibai\">Sara</a>, a poet, also from Beirut, who had been a member of the hackerspace <a href=\"https://lambalabs.org/doku.php/start\">Lamba Labs</a> until the space closed last month down due to disagreements between founders. Half the founders believed Lamba Labs was a community space for people to be creative and make, any one was welcome. The other half believed it was a place for serious technologists who focused on specific types of programming that should be welcome. They thought the hackerspace should be exclusive to their definition of “hackers”. The inability to compromise led to the closing of the Lamba Labs space.
<strong>Raja and Sara's story reminded me of a pattern I've seen before.</strong> Several times I've witnessed and/or heard stories like this. <strong>Stories of strict exclusion and elitism in certain segments of Hacker (and Maker) Culture.</strong>
How do we bring an extremely segmented series of communities together in a way that benefits everyone? How do we do it in a way that doesn't make people feel like a specific entity (e.g. \"Mozilla\") is trying to commandeer their community? How do we ensure that our own radical ideologies don't get in the way of collaboration, particularly in parts of the world where hacker/maker/idealist sub communities need to work together as a cohesive unit to bring about real change? How do we appreciate and understand nuances at a local level so that we can do a rethinking of our work when necessary?
<strong>Or do we just accept</strong> that the greater hacker community is segmented so drastically, not worry about it and just try to win over those who are willing to be won? How can we measure impact on the greater problem when we're only able to catalogue people that interact with us in specific ways?

After the talk, they introduced me to a few other people, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/h0mee\">Praveen</a>, a hacker and mentor at the <a href=\"https://www.noisebridge.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Noisebridge Hackerspace</a> in San Francisco. I started to explain a new concept I've been thinking about, what I'm calling the <strong>Pedagogy of Discomfort</strong>, but we were interrupted before I could finish explaining.
Basically, I've been thinking about the fact that:
<blockquote><em>“Emotional content can change the formation and recollection of a memory event, consistent with findings in both human and animal studies. Compared to neutral items, humans remember better emotionally arousing information, including emotionally charged stories, film clips, pictures, and words. “ <a href=\"http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cognition_and_emotion\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Luiz Pessoa</a></em></blockquote>
When I have a workshop, session, panel, class or presentation I am almost always extremely extroverted in the way I interact with my participants. The loudness of my personality (likely) makes people uncomfortable – I'm basing that on initial reactions – and I'm convinced that this <strong>discomfort aids in motivation and retention.</strong> At the beginning of my sessions, people express their discomfort in a variety of ways, mostly through body language and facial expression. By the end of my sessions, people are no longer uncomfortable, instead elated and excited about what they've learned. Of course I'm generalizing, but most of the time, people are truly happy to have gone through that shift from discomfort to learning.
This conversation with Praveen began moments before the start of <a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/282.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bankisaga: An Economic Tragicomedy</a>, a hilarious play about the economic collapse in Iceland.
After the play, we had an epic night of impromptu karaoke and dance-offs during which I got to hang around with plenty of other interesting, inspiring folks who are working to make the world a better place.
On <strong>Saturday</strong>, we ran our final workshop for a smaller group. I taught two ladies how to write HTML using a pen and post-it notes before they started playing around with Popcorn and Thimble. Despite my attempts to set them loose and get to making, both of these learners wanted/needed a more focused approach. I had fun teaching this way, but it also made me a bit uncomfortable because I was intensely aware of the role I had as the “instructor”. <strong>Still, teaching is about adjusting your expectations and helping people learn. This includes people who are unable or unwilling to make/play/remix without a baseline understanding.</strong>
After we spent a couple of hours making, it was time for food, then <a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/115.html\" target=\"_blank\">Food Hacking</a>, then a spontaneous reading of <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/zombies/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Zombies\">Chapter 1 of my unfinished, untitled, might-be-about-zombies book</a>, followed by a <a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/362.html\" target=\"_blank\">piano concert</a> and <a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/360.html\" target=\"_blank\">closing ceremonies</a> (including an amazing <a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/114.html\" target=\"_blank\">Spoken Word poem from Sara</a>). The rest of the evening was taken up by <a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/1.html\" target=\"_blank\">the party</a> (which had lots of lasers).
At some point in the evening (after doing some random tie-dying), we joined a group of folks that were recording a podcast for <a href=\"http://citizenreporter.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Citizen Reporter</a>. People in this group were talking about hacking to change the world and what “they” don't understand. I voiced concern when I felt like some of the participants in this conversation were generalizing too broadly and being somewhat incendiary about “them”. The conversation took me back to thinking about segmentation within the hacker community, and I tried to say “<strong>You have to meet people where they are</strong>” but I'm not sure if anyone got that.

The rest of my OHM experience was flat out delightful, so a special thanks to the folks who were on Rainbow Island singing songs and playing Pacman at 3am and to the couple we didn't mean to lose in the sea of hackers.

<h3>Thursday Timeline:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Went to “<a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/423.html\" target=\"_blank\">Programming is terrible—Lessons learned from a life wasted</a>” After which, I went looking for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClareSutcliffe\" target=\"_blank\">cofounder</a> of <a href=\"https://www.codeclub.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Code Club</a> whom I met in London a few months ago. She wasn't there, but I met the other cofounder, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hyper_linda\" target=\"_blank\">Linda</a>, for a brief moment. I introduced myself, mentioned <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\">Mozilla</a> and <a href=\"http://webmaker.org\" target=\"_blank\">Webmaker</a> and she said <strong>“Oh yeah, we're big fans, but in 80% of the schools we service, there's no Internet, so online tools are impossible for us to use.”</strong></li>
<li><strong>First Webmaker + MDN workshop</strong>, scheduled at the same time as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Andrews_Drake\">Thomas Drake</a> and <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesselyn_Radack\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jesselyn Radack\">Jesselyn Radack</a>'s talk, <a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/185.html\" target=\"_blank\">Enemy of the State</a> (which I would have also attended, had our workshop not been at the same time).
<ul>
<li>A few Mozilla fans showed up and after we got them started, they spent the time helping one another make things in Thimble. Unfortunately, a couple people became frustrated and packed in in as Persona constantly kicked them out while they were trying to make. <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=894860\" target=\"_blank\">This bug is really, really serious on the ground. </a></li>
<li>Ali and Janet talked about <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/tag/Mozilla/feed/www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox OS</a>, the MDN and Mozilla in general with another few people who were less interested in making (at the moment anyway) and more interested in understanding our mission and values. <a href=\"https://assdasdas.makes.org/thimble/asdlkj\" target=\"_blank\">The others made stuff like this.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Later, I attended part of the <a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/172.html\" target=\"_blank\">Evolution, Memory, Sex, Computers</a> talk and smiled big when the speaker mentioned that it was “quite likely” that the half-assed theory I wrote up <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/psycho/evolution-of-the-homosapieninformare/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> (the FIRST post I ever stuck on Zythepsary) is true</li>

<h3>Friday Timeline</h3>
<img alt=\"IMAG0780\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1970\" height=\"296\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMAG0780-500x296.jpg\" width=\"500\" />
On Friday, we decided to head to the festival a bit later in the day, both because we wanted to see some cheese (Alkmaar is the cheese capital of Holland, apparently), and because we wanted to have the energy to stay later, which meant not being in the sun all day.
Friday's workshop was well attended. Lots of people came because they wanted to learn how to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb</a> to others, how to make their own webpage or just what Mozilla is doing in education. The 2 hour session was highly focused on making and peer learning, and by the end of it I had a stack of post-it notes with bugs to file. Including:
<ul>

<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=901460\" target=\"_blank\">Code view should jump to the element where the User is clicking in display</a></li>
</ul>
<em>(Side note: today as I was sifting through said post-its, I couldn't reproduce everything and some of them I just flat out couldn't remember what I had meant).</em>
At the end of this session, I asked <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RedplanetAT‎\" target=\"_blank\">this attendee</a> what he thought of learning collaboratively and he said <strong>“I spent half the session teaching that other guy in CSS, and it was so much fun.”</strong>
After the workshop, Ali and Janet went to see some talks they were interested in, and I ran into a hacker <a href=\"http://twitter.com/thornet\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle</a> connected me with via Twitter.

<h3>Thursday Timeline:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Went to “<a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/423.html\" target=\"_blank\">Programming is terrible—Lessons learned from a life wasted</a>” After which, I went looking for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClareSutcliffe\" target=\"_blank\">cofounder</a> of <a href=\"https://www.codeclub.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Code Club</a> whom I met in London a few months ago. She wasn't there, but I met the other cofounder, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hyper_linda\" target=\"_blank\">Linda</a>, for a brief moment. I introduced myself, mentioned <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\">Mozilla</a> and <a href=\"http://webmaker.org\" target=\"_blank\">Webmaker</a> and she said <strong>“Oh yeah, we're big fans, but in 80% of the schools we service, there's no Internet, so online tools are impossible for us to use.”</strong></li>
<li><strong>First Webmaker + MDN workshop</strong>, scheduled at the same time as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Andrews_Drake\">Thomas Drake</a> and <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesselyn_Radack\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jesselyn Radack\">Jesselyn Radack</a>'s talk, <a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/185.html\" target=\"_blank\">Enemy of the State</a> (which I would have also attended, had our workshop not been at the same time).
<ul>
<li>A few Mozilla fans showed up and after we got them started, they spent the time helping one another make things in Thimble. Unfortunately, a couple people became frustrated and packed in in as Persona constantly kicked them out while they were trying to make. <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=894860\" target=\"_blank\">This bug is really, really serious on the ground. </a></li>
<li>Ali and Janet talked about <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/tag/Mozilla/feed/www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox OS</a>, the MDN and Mozilla in general with another few people who were less interested in making (at the moment anyway) and more interested in understanding our mission and values. <a href=\"https://assdasdas.makes.org/thimble/asdlkj\" target=\"_blank\">The others made stuff like this.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Later, I attended part of the <a href=\"https://program.ohm2013.org/event/172.html\" target=\"_blank\">Evolution, Memory, Sex, Computers</a> talk and smiled big when the speaker mentioned that it was “quite likely” that the half-assed theory I wrote up <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/psycho/evolution-of-the-homosapieninformare/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> (the FIRST post I ever stuck on Zythepsary) is true</li>

<p></p>
<p>Prior to the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=649537\" target=\"_blank\">great worker rewrite of 2011</a> exposing DOM objects in workers was pretty easy.  The same XPIDL/XPConnect layer that was used for most of the DOM worked off the main thread, and as long as the underlying implementation of your DOM object was threadsafe and you added a way to create the object in a worker or transfer it in (via postMessage) things just worked.  In fact, you could even <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ChromeWorker#Using_XPCOM_from_chrome_workers\" target=\"_blank\">send arbitrary threadsafe XPCOM objects</a> to ChromeWorkers.  But it turns out that XPConnect and the JS engine were not really threadsafe, and that we couldn’t share XPConnect and the JS engine state between threads.  So bent rewrote workers to use a separate JSRuntime.</p>
<p>XPConnect didn’t come along for the ride though.  Instead we took the opportunity to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=649537#c7\" target=\"_blank\">prototype</a> the next <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=580070\" target=\"_blank\">iteration</a> of <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/jorendorff/2008/10/09/quick-stubs/\" target=\"_blank\">quickstubs</a>.  XPConnect does a lot of work in each function call that can be done at compile time, at the cost of larger codesize.  As performance has become more and more important and codesize has mattered less, we have been moving towards using more and more generated code in the “binding\" layer and less dynamic conversion and dispatch via XPConnect.  So workers got the first iteration of what would become the <a href=\"http://jstenback.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/new-dom-bindings/\" target=\"_blank\">WebIDL bindings</a>: a handwritten JSAPI binding layer.</p>
<p>This binding layer ended up diverging from what we did for the main thread in a number of ways.  Most notably memory management is handled quite differently.  One of the hardest problems in web browsers is how to handle cross-language cycles.  References from JS to the language the browser is implemented in (C++ in existing browsers) are ubiquitous.  But references from browser code to JS can exist too (e.g. event listeners).  Once references can exist in both directions, there’s the possibility for cycles.  There are 3 options for dealing with these cycles:</p>
<ol><li>Use a separate memory management system for C++, and have special purpose code that glues these two systems together.  This is what Gecko does on the main thread with the <a href=\"http://rickeyre.ca/2013/06/20/webvtt-cycle-collector-demo.html\" target=\"_blank\">cycle collector</a>.  C++ side objects are usually reference counted, and the cycle collector breaks both pure C++ and C++-JS cycles.  It also handles tracing the JS objects owned by C++.</li>
<li>Use the JS garbage collector to manage the lifetimes of the C++ objects too.  This is what we chose to do on the worker threads.  In this setup there are never any C++->C++ edges, a C++ object owns the JS reflection of the C++ object it wants to keep alive.</li>
<li>Implement something hacky for event listeners and hope that nobody ever wants to implement an API that requires other sorts of C++->JS edges.  This is the <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2012JulSep/0054.html\" target=\"_blank\">WebKit approach</a>.</li>
</ol><p>Option 3 is obviously a non-starter.  Option 2 is potentially what we would do on both threads if we were writing a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.servo/ufJM51SF3G4/8qhJFUbHR9QJ\" target=\"_blank\">browser from scratch,</a> but it is a pretty severe impedance mismatch with the rest of Gecko.  Code that wanted to work on both threads would have to be written to own C++ and cycle collect on one thread and own JS and manually trace it on another.  This, combined with the lack of automated binding generation, has made adding new APIs to workers essentially impossible for people who aren’t already seasoned DOM hackers.</p>
<p>The WebIDL code generator solved the problem of writing the binding layer manually.  At the DOM meetup in London back in February we had a meeting where the rest of us overruled bent and decided to move workers to the cycle collector.  This involved some pretty serious refactoring work.  We had to separate a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=882162\" target=\"_blank\">large amount</a> of <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=885866\" target=\"_blank\">code </a>from XPConnect so it could be used on both threads, while adding some customization hooks so that XPConnect could insert some of the strange behavior that only the main thread needs.  Then we were finally able to stand up a worker thread <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=845545\" target=\"_blank\">cycle collector implementation</a> and port <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/c3ae42b64ce9#l4.1\" target=\"_blank\">ImageData </a>to use it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this work was repeatedly delayed.  First by <a href=\"http://robert.ocallahan.org/2013/05/taiwan-travelogue.html\" target=\"_blank\">travel</a>, then by the length of bent’s <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/request.cgi?action=queue&requester=&product=&type=all&requestee=%3Abent&component=&group=type&do_union=1\" target=\"_blank\">review queue</a>, later by <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=893012\" target=\"_blank\">some</a> <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=896755\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a> <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=897701\" target=\"_blank\">OS</a> <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=896825\" target=\"_blank\">work</a>, and then by the effort needed to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=897433#c27\" target=\"_blank\">unbitrot </a>the patches from some other cycle collector changes.  All of this led to a Q2 goal slipping a third of the way through Q3.  But it is finally done, and future work should allow more opportunities for parallelism.  Some of the existing worker thread objects can be converted to use the cycle collector without waiting for events.  Other APIs can be ported to worker threads now if they don’t use events.  And Olli can work on <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853893\" target=\"_blank\">events</a> now that I am no longer blocking him.</p>
<p>Best of all, we have some plans in the works to port some <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709490\" target=\"_blank\">very interesting stuff</a> to workers.  Keep your eyes peeled for more.</p>" nil nil "c0326c4aa15b89c912a8b0f559cb80e2") (472 (20991 23982 797292) "http://blog.alinamierlus.com/2013/08/on-friendship/" "Alina Mierlus: On =?utf-8?Q?friendship=E2=80=A6?=" "Alina Mierlus" "Sun, 04 Aug 2013 12:20:28 +0000" "<p>Walking through the streets of Sitges, I saw a sculpture of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Rusi%C3%B1ol\">Rosiñol</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Casas_i_Carb%C3%B3\">Casas</a> .

Hello Mozillians!
</p>
<p>
In early 2010 when I applied for an internship at Mozilla I was
anxious. It was a kind of test for what I learned and for the value
of the projects I did up until that point. That is when I met my
first manager. When I was invited to join the new developer tools
team, I was thrilled, excited and really happy that somehow \"I did
it!\". I did it in the sense that \"yes! now I can do real work!\",
and yes, since 2010 I work on things that make a difference. This
was, and still is, the job I really wanted to have. Back then, the
team was preparing the initial versions of the Web Console and of
the Inspector. We released the Web Console in Firefox 4.
</p>
<p>
In July 2010, when I started to work with the team, I was new to
XUL and Gecko-specific APIs for chrome-privileged JavaScript. Since
then I learned a lot more about technologies, about what it takes
to work in a big project, what it takes to work in a team and I
also learned about how managers work. I had no clue about a lot of
things, and learning never ends - which is what I really enjoy
about the work I am doing.
</p>
<p>
I had the opportunity to meet the whole team and other colleagues
from Mozilla on several occasions - in London, Sunnyvale, Mountain
View, San Francisco and soon in Paris. The people I met, the
Mozilla offices and places I have seen, have, in some ways, humbled
me about what the future can hold. They were all really great
experiences that I did not dream of.
</p>
<p>
A bit of stats: in three years I fixed approximately 300 bugs and
reported ~320 bugs (~210 are fixed already). I worked on the Web
Console (I still do), the Inspector, the Computed Style view (in
the really early days, in 2010), the Source Editor, the network
monitor (the backend for network logging which is shared with the
console), the <a>about:home</a> page introduced
in Firefox 4 and a bit on Panorama (the tab grouping feature
introduced in Firefox 4).
</p>
<p>
I look forward to continue to work on more cool projects and to
work with really great people! The people make Mozilla what it is
and they have been really great with me. For everything, big thanks
to my colleagues, managers and, actually, friends who work on tools
for the open web platform.

Busy times. So here you go with a casual Firefox tip:</p>
<p>One of my favorite \"hidden\" features in Firefox are \"smart keywords\". Essentially, you write a keyword + a phrase into the URL bar, and it'll issue a search on the site corresponding to this keyword.</p>
<p>For example, I enter <strong>\"wp elephants\"</strong> and it takes me to the Wikipedia page on Elephants, rather than searching Google for the phrase. Neat!</p>
<p>There is a great <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-search-from-address-bar\">Firefox Support article</a> on how to add you own keywords. Essentially you right-click on a search box on your favorite website and click \"Add a keyword for this search\":</p>
<p><img alt=\"add a search keyword\" src=\"http://fredericiana.com/media/2013/smartkeyword.jpg\" /></p>
<p>Here are the keywords I have added (I linked them to the search they represent, respectively):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=%s\"><strong>bug</strong></a>: Searches bugzilla.mozilla.org (bug 12345, for example)</li>
<li><a href=\"http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&lang=de&searchLoc=0&cmpType=relaxed&sectHdr=on&spellToler=&search=%s\"><strong>leo</strong></a>: Searches dict.leo.org (a German-English dictionary)</li>
<li><a href=\"http://dict.leo.org/frde?lp=frde&lang=de&searchLoc=0&cmpType=relaxed&sectHdr=on&spellToler=&search=%s\"><strong>leofr</strong></a>: Searches the French version of dict.leo.org</li>
<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&search=%s\"><strong>wp</strong></a>: Searches Wikipedia in English</li>
<li><a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spezial%3ASuche&search=%s\"><strong>dewp</strong></a>: Searches Wikipedia in German</li>
<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&q=%s\"><strong>imdb</strong></a>: Searches the IMDB movie database</li>
<li><a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=%s\"><strong>slang</strong></a>: Searches UrbanDictionary for English slang terms</li>
<li><a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/%s\"><strong>mw</strong></a>: Searches Merriam-Webster's dictionary</li>
<li><a href=\"http://wwwapps.ups.com/WebTracking/processInputRequest?sort_by=status&tracknums_displayed=1&TypeOfInquiryNumber=T&loc=en_us&InquiryNumber1=%s&track.x=0&track.y=0\"><strong>ups</strong></a>: Searches UPS for tracking numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>My attentive readers may have noticed that Firefox will just take the search term you entered and put it into the URL in place of the placeholder \"%s\". This way if you can't find a search box, you can still add a keyword search by bookmarking a URL, putting the placeholder \"%s\" in an appropriate spot, and assigning a keyword.</p>
<p>That's what I did with UPS, where I couldn't find a working search form on the website. So I snagged the URL Google uses when it does UPS tracking and manually assigned it a keyword.</p>
<p>Do you use any search keywords you'd like to share? Let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>Happy keyword hacking!</p>

<p>I'm <a href=\"http://fredericiana.com/2013/01/07/writing-challenge-accepted/\">blogging about once a week in 2013</a>, on various topics.

<p>Surely that can’t be the whole story.  A mozilla-central build from a day or two took about 24 minutes on my machine (Linux x86-64 hyperthreaded 8-core @ 2.6GHz, srcdir on SSD, objdir on mechanical hard drive).  We are not compiling 2.4x times more code than we were a year ago…or are we?  Let’s look at some numbers.</p>
<p>I looked at my mozilla-central repository for some convenient tags to pick from and found the <tt>FIREFOX_AURORA_${REV}_BASE</tt> set of tags.  I started compiling with mozilla-central tip, and then with <tt>FIREFOX_AURORA_24_BASE</tt>, and resolved to go as far back as I could without undue fiddling with things that wouldn’t compile.  I made it to <tt>FIREFOX_AURORA_14_BASE</tt> before hitting compilation errors with moz_free.  (19 and previous required small fiddling with <tt>js/src</tt> to set the right <tt>PYTHON</tt>, but that was easily scriptable.)  That gives me 11 markers covering over a year of development.</p>
<p>I didn’t try compiling things multiple times to see how much the numbers fluctuated.  I didn’t attempt to control for operating system disk caches or anything like that, just <tt>hg up -r $TAG</tt>, generated configure, ran <tt>configure --enable-optimize --disable-debug --disable-gstreamer</tt> (I haven’t bothered to get my gstreamer dependencies right on my development box) in a newly-created objdir, and recorded time for <tt>make -srj20</tt>.  The compiler was GCC 4.7 from Debian stable.</p>

<p>Those 10-minute clobber build times were apparently the result of warm disk cache or my dreams.  Or perhaps they’re due to an older compiler; I only started using GCC 4.7 recently and I’ve done some tests that show it’s a fair amount slower than GCC 4.4.  Or maybe I was using a different build config then.  Whatever the reason, we can see that compilation times have been increasing steadily, but can we correlate that to anything?</p>
<p>Let’s look at the number of C++, C, WebIDL, and IPDL source files. We include the last two because the conversion to WebIDL has been cited as a reason for increasing compilation times and IPDL because the IPDL compiler generates a number of source files as well (roughly three source files for every IPDL file). The C++ source files are split by extension; <tt>.cpp</tt> is the usual prefix to use inside Gecko, so separating <tt>.cpp</tt> and <tt>.cc</tt> gives some idea of how much outside C++ source code is being compiled. (Just counting source files is subject to issues, since we don’t compile everything <a href=\"http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/widget/\">in <tt>widget/</tt></a> for every platform, but we’re counting all the source files therein as if they were. This is a rough estimate.)</p>

<p>First things first: we have a lot of code in the tree.</p>
<p>Now, there’s a couple of interesting things to point out. While there’s a lot of IPDL source files, the increase in IPDL can hardly be held responsible for the increase in compile time. So that’s one suspect out of the way. From 16 to 17, we barely increased the amount of code, but build times went <strong>down</strong>. This change might point to the recorded times being subject to quite a bit of variability.</p>
<p>We added a lot of WebIDL files from 20 to 21 while holding everything else constant and build times went up quite a bit! But we added roughly the same number of WebIDL files from 21 to 22 along with a <strong>lot</strong> more code and while build times went up, they didn’t go up by the same amount: 28 minutes of user time going from 20 to 21 and ~20 minutes of user time going from 21 to 22. There are a number of reasons why this could be so: we might not be compiling all those 500 C/C++ source files we added in 22 (ICU landed off by default in 22, so that’s ~400 files right there), the WebIDL files added in 21 might have had more of an impact, compilation-wise, the timings might fluctuate quite a bit, and so on and so forth.  And notice that we added the same number of WebIDL files again from 23 to 24 and build times <strong>hardly changed</strong>.  Sure, WebIDL means more files to compile.  But I don’t think they are adding a disproportionate amount of time.</p>
<p>And finally, source code file counts.  We had about 7800 source code files to compile back at Aurora 15 (remember, IPDL counts as three).  We have about 10600 source files to compile now on trunk.  That’s about a 40% increase that corresponds to roughly a doubling in time to compile.  And yes, there’s also a lot of JS and other things that have been added that increase our time to compile.  But I don’t think the amount of source code is the whole story.</p>" nil nil "3bdbe55a7b9643e67078b100b6b949ea") (466 (20987 54922 452249) "http://sporadicdispatches.blogspot.com/2013/08/its-official-no-sdes-in-browsers.html" "Adam Roach: It's official: No SDES in the browsers."

In that post, I mentioned that RTCWEB was contemplating what role, if any, SDES would play in the overall specification.<br /><br />At yesterday's RTCWEB meeting, we concluded what had been a rather protracted discussion on this topic, with a wide variety of technical heavy hitters coming into express opinions on the topic. The result, as recorded in the <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/87/minutes/minutes-87-rtcweb\">working group minutes</a>, is:<br /><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><pre>Question: Do we think the spec should say MUST implement SDES,<br />MAY implement SDES, or MUST NOT implement SDES. (Current doc<br />says MUST do dtls-srtp)<br /><br />Substantially more support for MUST NOT than MAY or MUST<br /><br />**** Consensus: <b>MUST NOT implement SDES in the browser.<br /></b></pre></blockquote><br />So, what does this mean? The short version is that we just avoided a very real threat to WebRTC's security model.<br /><br />I'd like to put a finer point on that. There was a lot of analysis during the conversation around the difference in difficulty of mounting an active attack versus a passive attack, the ability to detect and audit possible interception, and a variety of other topics that would each require their own article (although I think <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/87/slides/slides-87-rtcweb-5.pdf\">Eric Rescorla's slides</a> from that session do a good job of summarizing the issues rather concisely). Rather than go into that level of detail, I want to share a brilliant layman's description of SDES by way of an anecdote.<br /><br />One of the RTCWEB working group participants brought along a companion to Berlin for this weeks' meeting. She sat in on the RTCWEB encryption discussion. When she asked what the lively conversation was all about, the working group participant directed her to the relevant portions of <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4568\">the SDES RFC</a>.<br /><br />Yesterday evening, when we were talking about the day's events, she summarized her impression of SDES based on this lay reading: \"It's like having the most state-of-the-art safe in the world, putting all of your gold inside, and then writing the access code on the outside.\"" nil nil "924904ef9271ee86af77da9a8e08dc73") (465 (20987 54922 449744) "http://blog.ziade.org/2013/08/02/loads-01-released/" "Tarek =?utf-8?Q?Ziad=C3=A9=3A?= Loads 0.1 released" "Tarek Ziade" "Fri, 02 Aug 2013 13:19:00 +0000" "<p>We're currently focusing on <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-services/loads\">Loads</a>
with Alexis and I have just released the first <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/loads\">version at PyPI</a>.</p>
<p>It's a distributed load testing tool.</p>
<p>It's still at a very early stage but I think it's worth releasing it to share
it with people that might be interested in doing heavy distributed load testing.</p>
<p>From a user's perspective, the key concepts of Loads are:</p>
<ol class=\"arabic simple\">
<li>Write functional tests in any language using the tools you love.
Currently we support Python using WebTest, Requests and/or ws4py for web sockets,
and Javascript using Mocha (the JS support is still experimental).</li>
<li>Use Loads to load test a server using those functional tests</li>
<li>Get the results in real-time</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to give it a shot, <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://loads.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/\">install it</a> ,
then follow the guide here: <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://loads.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide\">http://loads.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide</a> and let us
know what you think.</p>
<p>Beware that it's an early prototype, probably still full of bugs.</p>
<div class=\"section\" id=\"design\">
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>From a design point of view, this is how Loads is organized when you run a load test
across several servers:</p>
<div class=\"figure\">
<img alt=\"http://loads.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/loads.png\" src=\"http://loads.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/loads.png\" />
</div>
<p>Loads uses a ZeroMQ <strong>Broker</strong> that drives several <strong>Agents</strong> to run tests.
Tests results are sent in real time into a publisher.</p>
<p>In detail:</p>
<ol class=\"arabic simple\">
<li>The Loads program sends a message to the broker, asking it to run the
tests on N agents.</li>
<li>The broker selects available agents and send them the tests to run.</li>
<li>Each agent run the tests</li>
<li>When a test is done, whether it has failed or succeeded, the agent sends
back to the broker information about what happened.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class=\"section\" id=\"next-steps\">
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Right now, we've deployed Loads on AWS on several boxes, and started
to use it to load test a few of our applications we're currently
building at Mozilla Services.</p>
<p>The long term goal is to offer a load testing service to our team,
so anyone can send huge loads on a staging or dev application with
a simple command line call.</p>
<p>I hope that we will have something that works well by the
end of the summer and be useful to more people than our own team.</p>

Unlike role “presentation”, which marks only one particular element as uninteresting for accessibility, aria-hidden does the same for an element and all its child elements. </p>
<p>Especially considering that Chrome and Safari mercilessly prune the whole tree underneath and including the element marked with aria-hidden=”true”, dangerous things can happen if aria-hidden is used irresponsibly or carelessly.

<p>Firefox, therefore, takes a less offensive approach. We give aria-hidden marked elements an object attribute, but leave the element and its children in tact in the accessibility representation otherwise, so that screen readers can opt-in to ignore the sub tree.</p>
<p>And this is where Firefox OS suddenly comes into play. When <a href=\"http://monotonous.org\">Eitan</a> and I started working on this a year ago, we immediately noticed that there were several problems with Gaia, the UI and apps library shipping on Firefox OS devices. It is built completely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. When i started playing with a device, I noticed that apps were showing me content that was not on the screen, didn’t go away when I closed them, etc.</p>
<p>The reason for this behaviour was the fact that much of the styling in Gaia uses the z axis to “hide” elements. They just get pushed into the background. But putting stuff on a negative z axis does not prune them from the accessibility tree traditionally.</p>
<p>Eitan then started experimenting with changing the visibility to use display: none; or visibility: hidden; instead, depending on the reflow demands. While this solved some problems, it definitely didn’t solve all of them. Most importantly, there were often visual artefacts interfering with animations and other things. And the last thing we want is that accessibility is the cause for visual unpleasantness!</p>
<p>So in the course of the last two months, it became apparent that the least intrusive method of solving this problem is to introduce aria-hidden in strategic places into Gaia to manage what is visible to our screen reader, and what is not. Consequently, our screen reader for Firefox OS was enhanced to support ignoring trees that are marked with aria-hidden.</p>
<p>And here it is, the reason why I grudgingly accept aria-hidden as a useful reality. It not only solves a big chunk of problems with only a few attributes in strategic places. It also makes sure we do not interfere with the visual experience, and it saved us from having to touch each and every CSS in Gaia to manipulate it to fit our needs, and by doing so, cause that visual degrading we want so desperately to avoid. Also, it helps prevent breakage, because Gaia developers can change the relevant CSS without having to be afraid to break accessibility</p>
<p>So while I was searching for external sources to tell me why aria-hidden is actually useful and needed, the reason that convinced me built up inside Mozilla! <img alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.marcozehe.de/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<p>I still think that aria-hidden is a rather dangerous attribute, I count on the educational skills of the accessibility community at large to make sure the situation doesn’t get really bad! And I will do my part to help with that effort!</p>

<p>And here it is, the reason why I grudgingly accept aria-hidden as a useful reality. It not only solves a big chunk of problems with only a few attributes in strategic places. It also makes sure we do not interfere with the visual experience, and it saved us from having to touch each and every CSS in Gaia to manipulate it to fit our needs, and by doing so, cause that visual degrading we want so desperately to avoid. Also, it helps prevent breakage, because Gaia developers can change the relevant CSS without having to be afraid to break accessibility</p>
<p>So while I was searching for external sources to tell me why aria-hidden is actually useful and needed, the reason that convinced me built up inside Mozilla! <img alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.marcozehe.de/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<p>I still think that aria-hidden is a rather dangerous attribute, I count on the educational skills of the accessibility community at large to make sure the situation doesn’t get really bad! And I will do my part to help with that effort!</p>

<br />
Jason talked about multiple efforts he's involved in, including his early (and ongoing) work on <a href=\"http://textfiles.com/\">textfiles.com</a>, collecting writing from the time when people first got online, and some other initiatives I'll mention at the end of this blog, but the main focus was on The Internet Archive, the non-profit he is working for nowadays and which has public collections of historical digital content as its main mission.<br />
<br />
<a href=\"http://home.kairo.at/?d=g&i=317&m=f&f.i=23153\"><img alt=\"Image No. 23153\" src=\"http://home.kairo.at/?d=g&p=23153&f.m=normal\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 400px;\" /></a><br />
<br />
The site and organization are probably best known for the <a href=\"http://archive.org/web/web.php\">Wayback Machine</a>, which has archived \"over 240 billion web pages\" going back more then 15 years, see e.g. a <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/19990430050942/http://www.mozilla.org/\">Mozilla homepage from around the time when I first encountered the project</a>. But next to that, they have tons of other digital content archived - <a href=\"http://archive.org/movies\">video</a>, <a href=\"http://archive.org/audio\">audio</a>, <a href=\"http://archive.org/texts\">texts</a>, <a href=\"http://archive.org/projects/\">and more</a>. Jason said they are basically seeking to store everything available in digital format that could be of any historical use at some point - preferably first making sure it's store and worrying about legal questions only as they arise, as it's better to have something but take it down than to be able to publish it but not having lost it to history. He went as far as to say they want to be \"the hard drive of the Internet\" and store everything anyone gives to them, be it personal documents, software that was published at some point, or other digital content. For example their <a href=\"http://archive.org/details/software\">software collection</a> contains collections of entire FTP servers of the past as well as CD images and terabytes (!) of software and firmware for old systems to run in emulators.<br />
<br />
And there's an \"Upload\" button on the site as well, inviting me, you, and everyone else to contribute content that they can archive!<br />
So, if you have old digital content lying around, go to <a href=\"http://archive.org/\">archive.org</a> and make it available to the public, including the kids of the future, before it gets covered with enough dust or otherwise degrade in a way that the media can't be cleanly read any more.<br />
<br />
If you have really important pieces of history that are on media that you fear is too dusty and old to still be read cleanly, or where it's hard to find any drive to read that media any more, or you know of such things that might otherwise be hard to recover, you might be interested in another project that Justin Scott is involved in: the <a href=\"http://www.archiveteam.org/\">Archive Team</a>. That group is dedicated to rescue old digital contents where it's not easy, and to save history before it's actually lost. They have specialized equipment to read even aged disks and tapes, and they are building up communities to save sites before they die - they even <a href=\"http://archive.org/details/archiveteam-geocities\">archived most of Geocities before it died</a>!<br />
A quite awesome story is also how they helped to <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/04/prince-of-persia-source-code/\">recover the original \"Prince of Persia\" source code</a>.<br />
<br />
And then, there's one more of Jason's projects that Mozilla folks will probably like: <a href=\"http://jsmess.textfiles.com/\">JAVASCRIPT MESS</a>!<br />
<img alt=\"\" class=\"bb\" src=\"http://jsmess.textfiles.com/jssmurf3.png\" /><br />
Jason used <a href=\"http://emscripten.org/\">EmScripten</a> to port the <a href=\"http://www.mess.org/\">MESS emulator</a> into JavaScript and run it from a browser. Yes, you can run Atari 2600 or Sega Genesis games in the browser! This is only a beta right now, but it shows how the \"browser\" (or should I say \"web runtime\"?) can help us enable to make software history available to future generations!<br />
<br />
All those projects can profit from your help, so if you have anything you can contribute, please do so! <img alt=\":)\" class=\"icon\" src=\"http://home.kairo.at/?d=b&p=s_smile\" style=\"height: 19px; width: 19px;\" title=\"smile\" /><br />

<p>The first order of business was to add trace-saving capabilities to the tracer.  With this change, I could capture traces on my Android device and view them on my desktop, which is much more convenient than looking at them on my phone.  (Especially because <a href=\"http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/\">Simile Timeline</a>, which the about:timeline extension uses, is difficult to use on mobile and <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=846128\">slow in Firefox</a>, so it needs all the CPU power it can get.  If any JS hackers out there have a replacement timeline widget recommendation, I am all ears!)</p>
<p>The second order of business was to modify Firefox to start and stop tracing automatically, rather than requiring the user to push buttons in about:timeline.  Pushing buttons works fine on desktop, not so much on automated tests on mobile devices.  I experimented with way too many fully general solutions before settling on the straightforward path: modifying <a href=\"http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/docshell/base/nsDocShell.cpp#4066\">nsDocShell::LoadURI</a> to start and stop the tracer when certain URIs were fetched.</p>
<p>Now the tracer would automatically record profiles, on to viewing them!  I modified Jan’s about:timeline extension to function properly in a browser not built with event tracing support.  I also added the ability to use a trace saved in a file, rather than recording one in a browser.  You can see the changes I made in my <a href=\"https://github.com/froydnj/about-timeline\">about:timeline github repository</a>.</p>
<p>With all those changes in hand, we can view pretty pictures of what’s going on when the browser runs Eideticker tests.  First, a normal Firefox for Android.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/nfroyd/files/2013/08/android-cached.png\"><img alt=\"android-cached\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-194\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/nfroyd/files/2013/08/android-cached-580x365.png\" width=\"580\" /></a></p>
<p>That almost-4-second delay you see there is the cache getting opened.  Yes, that’s happening on the main thread and yes, it’s blocking everything else from moving forward.  This is a great illustration of why <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/nfroyd/feed/www.janbambas.cz/new-firefox-http-cache-backend-implementation/\">we are rewriting the network cache</a>.  If the cache is so slow, what happens if we disable the cache?</p>
<p><a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/nfroyd/files/2013/08/android-uncached.png\"><img alt=\"android-uncached\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-196\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/nfroyd/files/2013/08/android-uncached-580x365.png\" width=\"580\" /></a></p>
<p>It’s hard to tell from the picture, but if you looked at the Eideticker log of network requests, you’d see that everything completes somewhere around a 0.5-1 second faster (!).  Why doesn’t it speed up more than that, since we’ve removed all that cache blocking by disabling the cache?  Not sure yet, although you can see that cache entries are still getting opened.  Also, you can see highlighted in the picture that the first network request takes about 250ms to start executing from the time that it’s fired off.  That also needs to be investigated (and fixed!).</p>
<p>What about this new cache rewrite, how does it fare?  Thought you’d never ask.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/nfroyd/files/2013/08/android-newcache.png\"><img alt=\"android-newcache\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-195\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/nfroyd/files/2013/08/android-newcache-580x365.png\" width=\"580\" /></a></p>
<p>Again, you have to check out the HTTP request log, but this is still another 0.3 seconds or so faster than the <strong>uncached</strong> case that we see above.  So the new network cache is a clear win in this instance.  It’s worth pointing out that the network request delays are still present here and are taking slightly longer than the cache-disabled case.  Variance in profiles?  Effects of the new cache?  Not sure yet!</p>
<p>I’m still figuring out my way around the tracer, but it’s a useful tool to peer into the Firefox network stack.  It would be great if other subsystems (images, CSS, layout) would hook into the event tracer so we could have visibility into what they’re doing, too.  <a href=\"http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/xpcom/base/VisualEventTracer.h\">The API is pretty simple</a> and causes no runtime overhead in our usual release builds.</p>" nil nil "5b22e28936f0038b75f7b7a5033c9972") (460 (20987 26870 591951) "http://work.erikvold.com/bugzilla/2013/07/31/using-needinfo-bugzilla-pro-tip.html" "Erik Vold: Bugzilla Pro Tip - Use Needinfo" "Erik Vold" "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "<p>I see people forgetting to do this on a daily basis now, so I’d like to make the <code>needinfo</code> feature of <a href=\"http://bugzilla.mozilla.org\">Bugzilla</a> clear to everyone.</p>

<p>What’s open source got to do with it?</p>
<p>Free software sounds like a 70s era free-love pipe dream. The idea and a copyright hack to enable it were born in 1984, brought to term by an academic who just wanted to fix a problem he had with his printer.</p>
<p>Free and open source software underpin Cash Music’s platform. Why should that matter to you? Software developers prefer working with code they can freely read, understand and modify. But the benefits to end users are not always as clear.</p>
<p>There’s a method to the madness that is giving away something many believe is worth more if kept secret. It’s not just about sharing, but also accountability, choice and freedom. And, it’s about creating communities we love contributing to, with the kind of people we love to collaborate with.</p>

Mostly very common and well-known things: GMail, Picasa, seraching Google, reading news websites, talking on Skype, the Russian social network <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odnoklassniki\">Odnoklassniki</a>, and not much more than that.</p>
<p>One of the most curious things that I found in my experiences with them is that emails and popups about new features are completely unhelpful to them. They always call me when they get them and ask me what to do now. It is awkward, because basically the emails tell them what to do, but instead of reading them and learning, they are reading them aloud to me:</p>
<p>— “It says: ‘Now you can find your friends more easily by typing their names in the search box’—so what do I do now?”</p>
<p>— “I don’t know… When you want to find somebody, type their names in the search box maybe?”</p>
<p>I am not saying that my parents are stupid; they aren’t. I am saying that these emails are not helpful. They appear to arrive from the helpful people in Google or Odnoklassniki, but the fact is that every time it happens, my parents are confused.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder: Is the effectiveness of these emails and popups and callouts researched? What are they good for? I don’t find them useful, because I actually like to find out things by myself; that’s my idea of user-friendliness: if it’s not self-explanatory, it is not user-friendly. My parents don’t find them useful, because they ask me what do the have to do. So is it useful for anybody?</p>
<hr />
<p>PS 1: I know that Odnoklassniki is awful. They insisted.</p>
<p>PS 2: I know that Skype is not Free Software and that it doesn’t respect people’s privacy. Give me something properly Free that actually works. For what it’s worth, I did teach both of my parents to use Firefox and they hate other browsers, and on my mother’s laptop I installed Fedora, so except Skype, her online experience is almost completely Free.</p>

<p>The response usually involves asking the user what kind of technical expertise they have; if they’re a programmer, we point them at the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/wiki/Assertions\">specification</a>. If they’re not, well, we usually point them to a place like <a href=\"http://badg.us/\">badg.us</a> or <a href=\"https://credly.com/\">credly</a>.</p>
<p>One of the problems with pointing people at the specification is that it’s highly technical. JSON, the format the badge takes, is unfamiliar to non-programmers and doesn’t support code comments to make things a bit easier to grasp. Once a badge is hosted as JSON, the URL to the JSON file needs to either be opaquely “baked” into a PNG file, or it needs to be given to the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/wiki/Issuer-API\">Open Badges Issuer API</a> behind the scenes, which requires additional programming. Furthermore, the JSON file needs to at least specify a criteria URL, which necessitates the creation of a human-readable HTML page.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of parts.</p>
<p>But what if a badge were <em>just</em> a Web page, formatted in a consistent way that made it easy for machines to read?  What if issuing a badge was as easy as filling out a form, copying out a resulting HTML snippet and pasting it into your blog or website?</p>
<p><a href=\"http://microformats.org/about\">Microformats</a> can help us do this, because they were designed precisely for this kind of purpose.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the other solution: hosting one’s badges through third-party services like badg.us or credly.  While incredibly easy, one of the problems is that the badge metadata is hosted on—and therefore <em>issued by</em>—a domain that the badge’s creator doesn’t actually own. This will be particularly confusing for recipients and verifiers who discover that their badge was issued by a domain they may never have heard of.</p>
<p>When badges can be represented as HTML, however, we make it really easy for people to host badges on domains they already own. If someone’s presence on the internet is already represented by their blog or website, shouldn’t we make it as easy as possible for them to issue badges from there, rather than an unrelated domain?</p>
<p>I made a proof-of-concept Web service that allows you to play around with this idea at <a href=\"https://badge-bridge.herokuapp.com/\">badge-bridge.herokuapp.com</a>. Just fill out the form and paste the resulting HTML snippet in your blog or website, and you’re good to go. The snippet even includes a “push to backpack” button that allows the recipient to push the badge to their backpack.</p>
<p>One of the limitations with my service is that it’s really just a “bridge”, or hack, that translates between the Badge microformat I’m proposing and the JSON specification that Open Badge tools currently support. As a result, the issuer of the badge will appear to be badge-bridge.herokuapp.com rather than your actual blog or website. If we add an HTML microformat to the Open Badges specification, however, we won’t need a bridge, so this problem will go away.</p>
<p>For more information on the technical details of the microformat, including potential security concerns, see the <a href=\"https://github.com/toolness/badge-microformat-fun#readme\">README</a> for the Github project.</p>" nil nil "9e2c250720f378c9ad3f991b34776d2d") (454 (20986 6538 938255) "http://mryuked.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/end-to-almost-end-prototyping-please/" "Kevin Hanes: End-to-almost-end prototyping please" "kevinhanes" "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 18:51:10 +0000" "<p>you know what i want?</p>

<p>I think my first community involvement was early 2000 when I started helping people on usenet having technical problems creating web pages for Netscape 4. I was not a very technical person at that time (I had studied business and languages, computing was just a hobby) but I was very excited by the transformation of Netscape into an open source project and was regularly testing the Mx builds (which most of the time just crashed a few seconds after launch <img alt=\";)\" class=\"smiley\" src=\"http://www.chevrel.org/carnet/themes/dcBootstrap/smilies/wink.gif\" /> )</p>
<p>At that time, there was very few resources on the web about Mozilla and none in French. Since I was always answering the same questions on usenet, I started working on a FAQ in 2001 about Mozilla Suite (and later Netscape 7) which became the first (actually the only for a few years) semi-technical resource about Mozilla in French (a copy is still online here <a href=\"http://www.chevrel.org/fr/faq/\">http://www.chevrel.org/fr/faq/</a>).</p>
<p>From 2001 to 2003, I broadened my community involvement by translating my FAQ into Spanish, opening blogs about Mozilla in French and Spanish, translating documentation through the <a href=\"http://mozfr.mozdev.org/\">mozFR</a> project and getting involved in the <a href=\"http://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article3164.html\">Tech Evangelism program that Bob Clary had started</a>. In 2003, after chatting with Spanish Free Software advocates on IRC, I created the first Mozilla web forums in Spanish on the web, copying largely the format that mozillazine.org had chosen. A couple of months later, with many people from the community we had created the first Spanish-speaking portal about the Mozilla project, called <a href=\"http://www.mozillaes.org\">MozillaES</a> (which still exists). </p>
<p>Netscape was being shut down and it was clear to me that we had to strenghten Mozilla from the community side as there was no guarantee that the just created Mozilla Foundation would survive alone with just a <span>dozen</span> employees.</p>
<p>At the end of 2003, Tristan (that I knew from Usenet) contacted me to talk about the possibility of creating a European not for profit organization that would promote Mozilla and would help build a European community around the Mozilla project. This is how a bunch of Mozilla supporters created Mozilla Europe that we later presented to the larger FLOSS European community at Fosdem 2004. I quickly focused on what I was doing best, community building, and started working on bringing volunteers into translating the website into multiple languages (27), organizing/participating in events in Europe with the help of Mozilla Foundation (~20 events per year), building an internship program, guerilla marketing, PR... We also hosted firstrun/whatsnew pages for all of Firefox locales (not just European ones) for a couple of years so as to help Mozilla which was not ready for that. In parallel, I was also pursuing my involvement into other areas of the project, from writing simple extensions for Firefox and Thunderbird, working on promoting Mozilla by all means (creating multilingual Firefox download buttons, reporting bugs in bugzilla, organizing events, talking to the Spanish press...) to writing <a href=\"http://livre.fnac.com/a1656524/Pascal-Chevrel-Mozilla-Firefox-et-Thunderbird\">a book</a> about Firefox and Thunderbird.</p>
<p>Early 2006, Paul kim, marketing director at Mozilla corporation contacted me to work on first fixing then managing the localization of Mozilla web properties, build a community of localizers around it and continue my work as a Mozilla spokeperson for Spain (basically replicate what I had done as a volunteer in Europe but as paid staff and full time, cool isn't it <img alt=\";)\" class=\"smiley\" src=\"http://www.chevrel.org/carnet/themes/dcBootstrap/smilies/wink.gif\" /> ). Firefox 2.0 was planned for the end of the year in 40+ locales and was the first release fully localized both on the product and web sides.</p>
<p> I still hold this position and I also continue my community involvement, both at a personal level (like writing patches for the Linux version of Firefox, building collaboration  with other Libre software projects, empowering clever people to build cool Mozilla resources such as <a href=\"http://www.mozilla-hispano.org\">Mozilla Hispano</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bonjourmozilla.fr\">BonjourMozilla</a>, <a href=\"http://planete.mozfr.org/\">MozFR</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.mozilla-europe.org\">the European Community Blog</a>...) and at the professional level help release Firefox, Thunderbird and all of our other projects in 80+ languages across the world.</p>

</p>
<p>You may not know it (especially if you are not European), but Serbian can be written in both Cyrillic and Latin scripts, people live with the two writing systems, that is a phenomenon called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraphia\">synchronic digraphia</a>.
</p>
<p>I was wondering of it would be easy to create a version of Firefox or Firefox OS in Latin script and since our l10n community server just got an upgrade and now has PHP 5.4, I played a bit with the recent transliterator class in that version that uses the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/icusite/\">ICU</a> library.
</p>
<p>Basically, it works, and it works well. With one caveat though, I found out that the ICU library shipped with Linux distro is old and exposes a bug in Serbian transliteration that was fixed in more recent ICU libraries.
</p>
<p>How does it work? Here is a code example:
</p>
<pre><code>$source = 'Завирите у будућност';
$t = Transliterator::create('Serbian-Latin/BGN');
print \"Serbian (Cyrillic): $source <br>\";
print \"Serbian (Latin): {$t->transliterate($source)}\";
</code></pre>
<p>And here is the output:</p>
<p>Cyrillic: Завирите у будућност<br />
Latin: Zavirite u budućnost</p>
<p>The bug I mentioned earlier is that the cyrillic letter j is systematically converted to an uppercase J even if the letter is inside a word and should be lowercase.
</p>
<p>Example:
This string : Најгледанији сајтови<br />
Should be transliterated to: Najgledaniji sajtovi<br />
But my script transliterated it to: NaJgledaniJi saJtovi
</p>
<p>I <a href=\"https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=65361\">filed a bug</a> in the PHP ticket system and got an inmediate response that my test script actually works on Windows. After some investigation by the PHP dev, it turns out that there is no bug on the PHP side, the bug is in the ICU library that ships with the OS and it happens to be version 48.x on Linux distros while Windows enjoys a more recent version 50 and the ICU project itself is at version 51.2
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't find any .deb package or ppa for Ubuntu that would propose a more recent ICU library version, Chris Coulson from Canonical pointed me to this ticket in Launchpad: <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/icu/+bug/1088921\">[request] upgrade to icu 50</a>, but this was an unassigned one.
</p>
<p>As a consequence, I had to compile the newer ICU library myself to make it work. Fortunately, I could follow almost all the steps indicated in <a href=\"http://www.orocrm.com/forums/topic/centos-6-4-icu-installation-via-compilation\">this post for a CentOS distro</a>, I only had to adjust the php.ni locations (and also update the php.ini file for the development server) and restart Apache <img alt=\":)\" class=\"smiley\" src=\"http://www.chevrel.org/carnet/themes/dcBootstrap/smilies/smile.gif\" /> </p>

This post was fairly thought provoking for me because on some level I was projecting a very personal internal conflict that I have regarding my identity and work. I wrote the post because I was trying to understand my personal connection to badges, and what they could offer me - Jess Klein - as an individual. While I currently am employed in a job that I love, and surrounded by a community of intellectuals and design thinkers, I notice that I am constantly pushing myself to round out my work and to become what I consider to be a <i>real designer.  </i>This is a good desire, in my opinion, because I am constantly pushing myself to go further in my field and refine my craft.

So, I wonder - why would anyone use this? How would I use this? How will it help me to feel like a real designer and continue to enjoy my lifelong learning?<br /><br />On a very basic level a Badge Backpack currently is a place to store open badges and share them out with the world - big deal. But there are a lot of reasons that this should be a BIGGER DEAL. For starters, learners throughout their lives are constantly creating their \"data\" around their learning for someone, but rarely for themselves. This is an opportunity for learners to reclaim their data and to use it as a tool for analysis, self reflection and wayfinding. I don't have an answer as to how we can evolve our current Open Badges offerings yet, but I have a few rough ideas and some teaser images.<br /><br />1.

<p>The bug I mentioned earlier is that the cyrillic letter j is systematically converted to an uppercase J even if the letter is inside a word and should be lowercase.
</p>
<p>Example:
This string : Најгледанији сајтови<br />
Should be transliterated to: Najgledaniji sajtovi<br />
But my script transliterated it to: NaJgledaniJi saJtovi
</p>
<p>I <a href=\"https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=65361\">filed a bug</a> in the PHP ticket system and got an inmediate response that my test script actually works on Windows. After some investigation by the PHP dev, it turns out that there is no bug on the PHP side, the bug is in the ICU library that ships with the OS and it happens to be version 48.x on Linux distros while Windows enjoys a more recent version 50 and the ICU project itself is at version 51.2
</p>
<p>Unfortunatley, I couldn't find any .deb package or ppa for Ubuntu that would propose a more recent ICU library version, Chris Coulson from Canonical pointed me to this ticket in Launchpad: <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/icu/+bug/1088921\">[request] upgrade to icu 50</a>, but unfortunately this is unassigned.
</p>
<p>As a consequence, I had to compile the newer ICU library myself to make it work. Fortunately, I could follow almost all the steps indicated in <a href=\"http://www.orocrm.com/forums/topic/centos-6-4-icu-installation-via-compilation\">this post for a CentOS distro</a>, I only had to adjust the php.ni locations (and also update the php.ini file for the development server) and restart Apache <img alt=\":)\" class=\"smiley\" src=\"http://www.chevrel.org/carnet/themes/dcBootstrap/smilies/smile.gif\" /> </p>
<p>So now, I can transliterate easily from cyrillic to Latin a full repository, I put a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/pascalchevrel/6069330\">gist file online</a> with the full script doing the conversion of a repo if you want to use it.</p>" nil nil "607734742d8db14c7118825b0896268a") (448 (20984 50462 40461) "http://christianheilmann.com/2013/07/31/playing-with-leapmotion-for-accessibility/" "Christian Heilmann: Playing with Leapmotion for accessibility" "Chris Heilmann" "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 01:01:06 +0000" "<p>Today I spent a few hours in the <a href=\"https://www.leapmotion.com/\">Leap motion</a> offices talking about the web possibilities of this cool new technology. On the way back we had an internet connectivity outage, so it was a great opportunity to start playing with some of the ideas. Here is a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoytMqwygZ0&\">video of what I am working on</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In essence, this means:<br />
</p><ul><li>Swiping your finger right will scroll the page down, left will scroll up. The speed of the swipe defines the amount of pixels scrolled</li><li>Making a clockwise circular gesture will jump to the next link, making a counter-clockwise one to the previous link</li><li>A tap gesture in the air will activate the link</li></ul><p></p>
<p>The code is actually amazingly simple, once you use the <a href=\"https://github.com/leapmotion/leapjs\">Leap.js</a> library:</p>

This is a shameless plug for an add-on I worked on. It’s called <a href=\"https://trackif.com/\">TrackIF</a>. The way it works is that when you see a product you want to track the price of, you click the add-on button and add it to your tracker list. It will then notify you when the price drops or reaches a specific threshold. And it’s not just about stores, you can track craiglist, eBay or even real estate.

<p>Last week I was at O’Reilly Open Source Convention representing the Mozilla Community and meeting with folks to talk about some of the cool things going on in the Mozilla Community.</p>
<p>This year was especially exciting because Mozilla sponsored Community Leadership Summit the weekend before which had an amazing turnout and had several Mozillians in attendance. Even better, OSCON itself had a great line up of Mozillians speaking about technology and topics they are passionate about.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the week several of us gathered and I hosted a Mozilla Birds of Feather session which saw a small but good turnout of developers and even students from Oregon State University Open Source Labs. It was interesting because even the non-Mozillians had strong ties to the Mozilla community in one manner or another.</p>
<p>I think OSCON was a great opportunity for Mozillians this year to engage the greater open source community and do some networking but I think next year we can have a even larger role and perhaps a booth where we can do some Firefox OS evangelism.</p>

<h3>Dark Pattern: False Features</h3>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Providing and touting a feature that does absolutely nothing, something completely different, or worse the opposite of what it claims to do.</p>
<h4>Example: Do Not Track</h4>
<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track_Policy\">Do Not Track</a> is not what its’ title says, it is a completey anti-intuitive feature whose title and function are completely different. The title is meant to stir up emotion (after all who wants to be tracked?) and the meaning has nothing to do with tracking, it has to do with advertisting. Furthermore the “feature” does absolutely nothing, it is completely ignorable (meaning websites can choose to ignore it), and so it is typically ignored.</p>
<p>I first discovered this dark pattern when filing <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=858839\">Bug 858839</a>.</p>
<p>I remember when Mozilla first implemented the “feature”, there was a lot of self boasting (which still continues) about being the first browser to implement this do nothing feature, and ofcourse every other browser quickly supported it because it is in fact a do nothing feature which produced a ton of hype. The fact is that even Mozilla web developers ignore the DNT header (see <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=858839\">Bug 858839</a>), and use obfuscated explanations that “tracking” really means “advertising” in order to divert attention from the dark pattern.</p>

After all reacting late is almost as bad as not reacting at all.</p>
<p>So here are some of my tips on how to spot a white elephant design:</p>
<h3>1. Give It Resources!</h3>
<p>Will the design require a ton of development before any prototyping can be done?</p>
<h3>2. Straight To Product!</h3>
<p>Is the designer claiming that the idea should just land in Firefox immediately when it could obviously be an extension first?</p>
<h3>3. Add It To That New Thing!</h3>
<p>Is the designer claiming that adding the design to some new product (which is already in development) would be a good test bed for the design?</p>
<h3>4. It’s Going To Need Marketing!</h3>
<p>Is the designer claiming that the design will require marketing?</p>
<h3>5. It’s Totally Better I Swear!</h3>
<p>If the designer drops dead tomorrow, is there no one else that can pick up the design and speak for it?</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you can say yes to any of the above, then beware, because you might be looking at a white elephant design.</p>" nil nil "ca6be5d2d9d9e663cf999225182c44c9") (440 (20984 50462 35925) "http://dbaron.org/log/20130729-debug-builds" "L. David Baron: Why debug builds (and assertions) are important" "David Baron" "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 00:35:00 +0000" "<div>
<p>I want to talk about why <code>DEBUG</code> builds are important.</p>
<p>First, though, I'd like to clarify terminology.  When developers talk
about debug builds, they might be talking about one of three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>builds that have the <code>DEBUG</code> macro defined, so that <code>#ifdef DEBUG</code> blocks are used</li>
<li>builds that have compiler-generated debugging information, so that they work better in a debugger</li>
<li>builds that have optimization disabled, so that they work better in a debugger</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to talk about the first of these, the <code>#ifdef
DEBUG</code> blocks.  The most important difference when
<code>DEBUG</code> is defined is often that assertions (in their various
forms) are checked.  See, for example <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3d40d270c031/content/base/src/Element.cpp#l897\">the
beginning of Element::BindToTree</a> (which is called when an Element is
attached to its parent).  All of these NS_PRECONDITION macros are tested
only in debug builds.  They're not included in the release builds that
we ship to users because they would slow things down.  But in debug
builds, they print a warning to the console, and they cause any xpcshell
test to fail, and causes any reftest or mochitest (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=847275\">except
browser-chrome mochitests</a>) that isn't already marked as having known
assertions (i.e., known failures) to fail.  We also have fatal
assertions, such as the <code>MOZ_ASSERT</code> macro, which cause any
debug build to crash instantly, which would cause any test that hits it
to fail.</p>
<p>To explain one reason this is important, I'd like to step away from
software engineering for a minute and talk about airplanes.  Airplanes
are expected to be really safe, and the people who make them and fly
them have developed ways of doing that to make them safe.  One of these
is the idea that it's generally hard for an airplane to fail
catastrophically with only one thing going wrong; most serious airplane
crashes have required multiple failures.  Consider, for example, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_191\">crash
of American Airlines Flight 191</a> in 1979.  In this incident, due to
faulty repair procedures, the left engine detached from the wing due to
failure of the rear engine mount, swung around in front of the wing, and
ejected itself over top of the wing.  This, alone, should have been
survivable.  However, the engine detaching from the wing damaged the
hydraulic lines and cut power to some monitoring systems whose power
source was only connected to a single engine.  The damaged hydraulic
line led the leading edge slats on the wing to retract, reducing the
aerodynamic stall speed of that wing to below its takeoff speed, and
causing the aircraft to roll over and crash.  The response to this crash
was not only to forbid the maintenance procedures that damaged the
engine mount.  The response also included mandating slat relief valves
so that the slats would not retract due to loss of hydraulic
pressure.</p>
<p>So, back in the world of software, there are also times we want to
make sure a single mistake can't lead to a serious failure.  For
example, when I see an exploitable security bug, I often want to fix
that bug in two different ways, so that a single mistake, alone,
couldn't lead to a similar bug happening again.
(See, for example, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=607222#c53\">followups
to bug 607222</a> or the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=468645#c33\">multiple
fixes to bug 468645</a>.)
This is possible quite
often, as many exploitable security bugs are the result of a sequence of
things going wrong, just like airplane crashes.</p>
<p>But when bad things don't happen immediately when something goes
wrong, how do we know that something is wrong in the first place?
That's one thing all these assertions are for.  They document our
understanding of how the system is supposed to work.  We generally
shouldn't crash in an exploitable way when one thing goes wrong.  But we
generally should assert.  The assertion might show that something has
gone wrong that we assume won't, or that something has gone wrong which
we know will produce bad results when interacting with another feature
(even if it might not be interacting with that feature when the
assertion fires).  Running all of our test suites in debug builds and
making the tests fail when new assertions fire allow us to prevent
introducing these first-step-of-a-sequence problems in anything tested
by our test suites.</p>
<p>Also (and less related to airplane crashes), the process of debugging
a software problem is often a process of working backwards in time:  we
observe a problem and figure out what led to that state.  This leads to
another case where it's useful to have assertions:  to document things
that we know will lead to a failure (such as a crash) in the near
future, but which represent a much easier point to debug backwards from
(for example, the assertions about callback reentry in <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3d40d270c031/xpcom/glue/pldhash.cpp\">pldhash</a>).
When good assertions are present, problems are often easier to debug,
since there will be assertions documenting something that goes wrong
earlier, which shortens the amount of working backwards that we have to
do to find the problem.</p>
<p>Likewise, we can also use assertions so they fire in cases where we
know something has gone wrong, but we might not notice it.  For example,
if we can write an assertion that will fire in a certain case where
things would be drawn incorrectly, we'll detect any case in which that
incorrect painting happens, even if it happens in the middle of a test
that was designed to test something else and isn't actually looking at
what appears on the screen.</p>
<p>So assertions, the key component of debug builds, help us in multiple
ways.  They prevent problems from being introduced that are one step of
a sequence that could lead to more serious problems, and they help us
debug failures that have been observed in other ways, and they allow us
to increase our test coverage.</p>

<p>Continuous deployment is the holy grail of application development. It reduces bottlenecks between stages of the development process, allowing the team to move faster and be pretty confident in the quality of the code. Once in place, it can also reduce the work to test and release new functionality. We think it’s a win for everyone.</p>
<p>It also means pushing every code change to a production environment (that’s the deployment part). Our team is interested in a variation of this called continuous delivery, which means that we have the <em>ability</em> to push to production at any time. This will give us more flexibility, since we’ll be able to separately make code changes and update the site when it is most convenient for the team.</p>
<p>What do we need to build to move to continuous delivery?</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous integration server</li>
<li>Source control commit check</li>
<li>Simple deployment script</li>
<li>Real-time alerting</li>
<li>Root cause analysis</li>

<p>One of the tools that Firefox developers interact with nearly daily is
Mercurial. As I've observed from coworkers and from community
contributors, many don't have Mercurial configured for optimal
development. For first-time contributors, this can manifest in patch
rejection - an experience that can be embarassing and demotivating. This
is frustrating to me because most issues are easily identifiable and
correctable. And, when addressed, everyone wins.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm pleased to announce that there is now a configuration wizard
in the Firefox source tree to help with configuring Mercurial. To run it,
just type:</p>
<pre><code>./mach mercurial-setup
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, it's aimed for first-time contributors. So, it's missing
things that more seasoned developers rely on. But you need to start
somewhere, right?</p>
<p>Currently, the tool isn't advertised anywhere other than <em>mach help</em>.
Please run it and report issues in
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=794580\">bug 794580</a> or
file a new report. Once things have baked in, I'd like to add some kind
of notification/tips system to mach where it will encourage you to do
things like automatically run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em>. Until then, I
recommend trying to remember to run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> every few
weeks to ensure your Mercurial environment is up to date and properly
configured.</p>

<p>There's another project called <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/translate-toolkit/en/latest/index.html\">Translate Toolkit</a>
that you could use for item 1, but it doesn't have Pirate! and I like
my pipeline architecture since it's more \"pluggable\" (whatever that
means). Plus it didn't have a linter that covered my specific issues

The main difference is that the “x” tests stress Firefox by iterating animations as fast as possible, AKA “ASAP mode”.</p>
<p>The old tests were performing some animation and then report overall (or average per frame) duration. However, they were using intervals which were not stressing Firefox at all, making the results almost meaningless WRT svg/scroll performance, and rather mostly sensitive to timing changes.</p>

<p>After previous work which went into improving tab animations in Firefox, It’s time to put it into Talos. TART is implemented as an addon which works either stand alone or from within Talos. It measures frames intervals during different animation cases, and it works equally well on mozilla-central and on the UX branch.</p>
<p>Joel Maher did most of the talos side of things, and currently the addon awaits review.</p>
<ul>
<li>TART tests animation on 3 main cases:
<ul>
<li>“simple” - open/close of about:blank.</li>
<li>“icon” - open/close of a blank html page with favicon and a long title.</li>
<li>“newtab” - open with and without newtab preload.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“simple” is tested at DPI scaling of 1.0, “icon” at scaling of 1.0 and 2.0, and “newtab” at default scaling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each animation produces 3 result values:
<ul>
<li>“all” - Overall average interval.</li>
<li>“half” - Average interval over 50% of the designated duration - from the end of the animation backwards.</li>
<li>“error” - The difference between the designated duration to the actual one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, “half” is the value which corresponds to the stable part of the animation once it’s hopefully settled. Most tab animations have first frame (or few) which are longer than the rest, so the “all” value, while not meaningless, doesn’t tell the whole story.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some issues which had to be resolved while working on TART:
<ul>
<li>Inactive tabs are throttled, so to get accurate timing (intervals, end event), the test is executed from the Chrome window (rather than from the tab itself).</li>
<li>At DPI scaling of 2.0 at the talos window size, Australis can’t open a second tab without shrinking the first (thus measures animation of more than one tab). Solution: keep the TART tab pinned.</li>
<li>On OS X, “ASAP mode” doesn’t work with OMTC. Solution for now: disable OMTC for TART.</li>
<li>On ASAP mode, mostly on OSX, paints can be starved (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=880036\">bug 880036</a>). Solution: use a temporary pref to prevent this (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=884955\">bug 884955</a>).</li>
<li>At DPI scaling of 2.0, Australis can only have 3 tabs before it starts overflowing the tabstrip (e.g. <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=891450\">bug 891450</a>). This made it very hard to test multi-tab shrink/expand in a comparable fashion on m-c and Australis, and eventually this test was dropped for TART v1.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can watch TART at <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=848358\">bug 848358</a>. Other than a review, it also awaits <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=888899\">bug 888899</a> which should enable “ASAP” (stress) mode on OS X as well.</p>
<h3 id=\"absolute-scroll-smoothness-on-windows\">Absolute scroll smoothness on windows</h3>
<p>I was asked by <a href=\"http://taras.glek.net/\">Taras</a> to look into scroll smoothness on windows. Apparently, even after vlad’s great <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=731974\">timing improvement</a>, the timers <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=590422\">filter removal</a> and making vsync on windows <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856427\">work</a>, Firefox still almost never scrolls 100% smoothly on windows.</p>
<p>I did some extensive research into scroll performance of Firefox and other browsers on various platforms, and posted the results at <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=894128\">bug 894128</a>. You’ll also find there a a bookmarklet to test scroll performance on any browser.</p>
<p>One interesting observation is that it’s very hard to programatically detect if the scroll is absolutely smooth. Frame intervals apparently don’t tell the whole story (though they are not meaningless), and neither their standard deviation. To judge if the scroll is 100% smooth, it has to be assessed visually.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some interesting observations from this research:
<ul>
<li>On OS X, even with 50% perf per core (and half the cores as well) compared to a fast Windows system, Firefox scrolls much smoother than on Windows, even with OMTC off.</li>
<li>Firefox may occasionally degrade scroll for several frames for no apparent reason (the content is homogenous). GC/CC?</li>
<li>OMTC typically doubles the throughput on OS X. On windows OMTC is not yet mature enough to test this.</li>
<li>Very low intervals variance is <em>not</em> required for 100% smooth scroll (though IE and Chrome mostly manage very low variance compared to Firefox).</li>
<li>Looks like Chrome and IE use something like APZC during scroll. IE is especially exceptional and is able to practically never drop a frame even on extremely low-end HW (Atom z2760), and also almost never show blanks during scroll.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jet has already shown interest in looking into it. Hopefully some day Firefox will scroll as smooth as it can get…</p>" nil nil "35c6b7c55bfe1c8b63c0236d9d2c3fd1") (434 (20984 50462 31790) "http://www.darktrojan.net/news/2013-07/rethinking-add-on-localization" "Geoff Lankow: Rethinking add-on localization" nil "Sun, 28 Jul 2013 11:31:25 +0000" "<p>As an add-on developer, I don't like doing localization.

I’m sure it’s on a roadmap, but as with all v1 products you have to make some tough calls when it comes to feature prioritization.</p>
<p>This tutorial provides a step-by-step walk through of how to backup and restore your contacts on a B2G or FirefoxOS phone.

<p>To complete this tutorial you’ll need a B2G/FirefoxOS phone, a USB cable to connect your phone to your computer, and the <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html\">Android Debug Bridge</a> installed (referred to as `adb` later in the tutorial).</p>
<p>1. Start up your FirefoxOS phone and go to <em><strong>Settings</strong></em>.</p>

<p>2. Go to <em><strong>Device Information</strong></em></p>
<div id=\"image\"><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/JbTGG16.png\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JbTGG16.png\" /> </a></div>

<div id=\"image\"><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/q7ta2i9.png\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/q7ta2i9.png\" /> </a></div>
<p>5. Enable “<em><strong>Remote Debugging</strong></em>”. This will allow you to use ADB to pull data off of the phone.</p>
<div id=\"image\"><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZSKf0F7.png\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZSKf0F7.png\" /> </a></div>
<p>6. Connect your phone to the computer using the USB cable.</p>
<p>7. In your console, type `<em><strong><code>adb devices</code></strong></em>` to check that the phone has connected properly. You should see your phone listed as an attached device. At this point you can now use `adb shell` to browse through the system files on the phone.</p>
<p>8. Type `<code><em><strong>adb pull /data/local/indexedDB/chrome/3406066227csotncta.sqlite</strong></em> .</code>` This will pull the contacts IndexedDB database off of your phone and in to your local working directory. If you are curious about the contents of the database, you can <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/indexeddb-browser/\">install the IndexedDB Browser add-on for Firefox</a> which will let you open up the database.</p>

<p>And you are now done with backing up your contacts. If you need to reset your phone in the future, you can just follow these steps again but replace step 8 with the following: `<code>adb push 3406066227csotncta.sqlite /data/local/indexedDB/chrome/3406066227csotncta.sqlite</code>`.

<h3>What is gecko.git?</h3>
<p>
<a href=\"http://git.mozilla.org/?p=releases/gecko.git;a=summary\">gecko.git</a> is a git repo on git.mozilla.org that Mozilla's B2G partners view as the Repository of Record (RoR) for Mozilla B2G gecko code.  It's a read-only synced version of a <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/users/hwine_mozilla.com/repo-sync-tools/file/ac1ed25c3533/keep_updated#l58\">handful of Mozilla's mercurial gecko repos</a>.
</p><p>
<a href=\"http://dtor.com/halfire/index.html\">Hal Wine</a> set this repository up, using his <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/users/hwine_mozilla.com/repo-sync-tools\">vcs-sync</a> <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/users/hwine_mozilla.com/repo-sync-configs/\">repos</a>; his <a href=\"http://people.mozilla.com/~hwine/tmp/vcs2vcs/\">vcs-sync docs</a> are well written and comprehensive for the single-repo variety of job.
</p><p>
As <a href=\"http://dtor.com/halfire/2013/05/20/2013_Releng_talk.html\">Hal noted in his RelEngCon talk</a>, this repository has a number of requirements we don't have elsewhere (see the \"Challenge Areas (Con't)\" section):
</p><ul><li>
all changes must be fast-forwardable; no deletes
</li><li>
the conversion is not foolproof
</li><li>
git email validation is stricter than hg
</li><li>
commits already live on hg.mozilla.org, so we have to change hg-git to allow for special cases
</li></ul><p>
We have identified some upstream processes and behaviors that would cause problems, should they show up in gecko.git.  For example, historically our <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Merge_Documentation\">merge day process</a> has involved closing the tip of the downstream branch (e.g. Aurora), and landing the upstream branch (e.g. Central -> Aurora) in, creating a new default head.  This process violates the \"only fast-forwardable changes\" rule above.  We were avoiding this issue previously by not converting the aurora/beta/release repos, and only pushing the b2g18* repos, which don't ride trains.
</p><p>
Since then, we identified <code>hg debugsetparents</code> as a potential solution to make the merge day landings artificially fast-forward; it's unclear if we currently have that implemented.  We would need to before we could successfully push aurora/beta/release to gecko.git without violating this fast-forward rule.
</p><p>
Also, our current release process for Firefox desktop and Firefox Mobile (aka Fennec) involves creating a BUILD<i>n</i> tag and a RELEASE tag.  The former generally doesn't change; the latter changes on any respin.  Because of this, we use a <code>-f</code> in our <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools/file/46ab5f5bacf2/scripts/release/tag-release.py#l53\"><code>hg tag</code> command</a>.  Here's <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/rev/a4d3a6506491\">a changeset where we move a RELEASE tag for a build 2</a>.
</p><p>
However, <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html#_on_re_tagging\">Git doesn't allow for re-tagging</a> like mercurial does.  If you push a new tag with the same name as an old tag, any downstream repository owners will need to take action to move their tags.  This is problematic on sensitive release repositories that multiple downstream partners rely on.
</p><p>
I can imagine two longer-term solutions here: one is to continue to severely limit which tags can be pushed to gecko.git; the other is to change how Mozilla's release automation determines which revision to pull.  Our current strategy of not pushing aurora/beta/release has delayed this decision.
</p><p>
As noted in <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.gaia/KNk8ebA2jLE/ZqkGr-J2QL4J\">a recent thread (Whoops, I'm bad with git...)</a>, it's safest to not make changes to git history if there are <a href=\"http://justinhileman.info/article/git-pretty/git-pretty.png\">enough users downstream to form a lynch mob</a>.

<h3>What is beagle?</h3>
<p>
I'm not entirely sure about the code name, but the purpose is an official replacement of <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central\">Ehsan's github/mozilla/mozilla-central repo</a> with shas that match gecko.git.  (Due to differences in the conversion processes and toolchains, the current two repos' shas do not match.)
</p><p>
As I understand it, this is a developer-oriented repo, with important mercurial repos pulled in as git branches.  This allows for easier cross-branch diffing for git-based developers, though landings still happen in hg.
</p><p>
There are a number of <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/branches\">branches tracked by the existing github/mozilla/mozilla-central repo</a> that don't necessarily follow the above rules for gecko.git, which complicates having a single git repo that serves both purposes.  Notably, larch, birch, alder, and cypress are project branches, which, if they follow the standard project branch life cycle, will get hard-reset at some point.  This violates both the expectation of fast-forwardability as well as no deletes.  And, as noted above, it appears as though the movable *_RELEASE tags from the beta+release repos are getting populated here, which would be problematic for gecko.git.
</p><p>
Also, if the \"Whoops...\" thread was any indication (as well as the occasional \"please purge this revision from hg.m.o\" bug that pops up): in this world of many downstream users, we have to become better at not needing to purge revisions or rewrite history.  But given a split between a partner-oriented gecko.git and a developer-oriented beagle, we're at least allowed some additional leeway in the latter.
</p><p>
I tackled the beagle project with an eye to being able to support both gecko.git and beagle.

<h3>Problems encountered / lessons learned: master-only conversion</h3>
<p>
I came in with the assumption that this was a fully solved problem, and I would merely be making existing processes more robust, more scalable, and maintainable.  RelEng is currently converting and supporting over 300? repos on git.mozilla.org, using early prototype code currently live in production, so this needs to be improved.  And certainly, many of the issues were already fixed and upstreamed, and many of the processes were <a href=\"http://git.mozilla.org/?p=users/eakhgari@mozilla.com/mozilla-history-tools.git;a=blob;f=initial_conversion/README.md;h=f57d06b1706235406e15b218effba46e572e25ef;hb=3c8e758d128e42b7ce36010a4bd0d752e5f96b78\">well</a> <a href=\"https://people.mozilla.com/~hwine/tmp/vcs2vcs/clean_room_run-4.html\">documented</a>, just not all.  I definitely underestimated how much I would have to learn about the process.
</p><p>
However, I knew that I would be changing the workflow and process (as Hal is fond of saying, his scripts are a proof of concept running in production).  I wasn't going to just tweak existing scripts; I wanted to make the entire process automated and config-driven, rather than human-intensive.
</p><p>
How best to test these changes?  The most data we have to test with is in m-c history.  So converting m-c from scratch, and verifying that everything looks the way we want afterwards, was the best test for my new process.
</p><p>
The project was down-scoped to just hg->git conversions. (Previously I had been aiming for a generic, config-driven vcs sync project that could convert hg -> git or git -> hg, or sync hg -> hg or git -> git (e.g., github -> git.m.o) to cover all of our vcs-sync needs.)  Once I had a machine to test on, I started my first m-c conversion to verify my script + configs.  About a week in, <a href=\"http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2013/04/14/making-hg-git-faster/\">gps blogged about faster hg-git</a>.
</p><p>
<a href=\"http://escapewindow.dreamwidth.org/237935.html\">As I noted earlier</a>, I switched over.  But that wasn't seamless; Hal was running on a <a href=\"http://puppetagain.pub.build.mozilla.org/data/python/packages/hg_git-0.3.2-moz2.tar.gz\">forked hg-git 0.3.2</a>; gps' changes were landed as a part of 0.4.0.  Rather than try to backport gps' changes, we thought I should use the latest hg-git (0.4.0), since as far as we knew all of the forked changes had been upstreamed.
</p><p>
However, as noted in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=835202#c9\">bug 835202 comment 9</a>, my conversion failed using the latest upstream hg-git; <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/hg-git/UE65Ba-FXiE\">our timezone fix had never been upstreamed</a> because of missing unit tests.  When I <a href=\"http://puppetagain.pub.build.mozilla.org/data/python/packages/hg-git-0.4.0+.tar.gz\">forked hg-git with this patch</a>, I was able to continue and convert everything as expected... except the shas diverged.  Which I consider to be a major no-no, a violation of a central goal of this project.
</p><p>
It turns out that hg-git 0.4.0 deals with <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/26a2aacf9e3a4322a15378a7101adbcb6dfd7dfb\">this revision</a>, which I fondly refer to as <code><h<surkov</code>, differently than Hal's 0.3.2-moz2 fork.  These <a href=\"https://github.com/escapewindow/hg-git/commit/706fb1750102e304e88c4e00e110342964a145fb\">two</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/escapewindow/hg-git/commit/58ba440425ada6e0f1338c8243c556d9ea8cc870\">revisions</a> change the second angle bracket '<code><</code>' into a question mark '<code>?</code>', turning the initial portion of the email address into <code><h?surkov</code>.  The previous behavior was to drop the second angle bracket '<code><</code>' entirely, <a href=\"http://git.mozilla.org/?p=releases/gecko.git;a=commit;h=bb21a29da4b38469de567d33065a059fac2d46c5\">as seen in gecko.git's</a> <code><hsurkov</code>.  Both are valid ways to change <code><h<surkov</code> into a well-formed git email address, but only one of these resulted in the same shas as gecko.git.  I <a href=\"https://github.com/escapewindow/hg-git/commits/master\">backed those commits out of my hg-git fork</a>, and started verifying that my latest <a href=\"http://puppetagain.pub.build.mozilla.org/data/python/packages/hg-git-0.4.0-moz2.tar.gz\">0.4.0-moz2 fork</a> gave us expected behavior.  And it did, for a master-branch-only conversion, like we currently have in gecko.git. (Phew!)
</p><p>
(While it may seem like I was spending an inordinate amount of time converting and re-converting mozilla-central, I was, in fact, testing against the largest data set we had in terms of unexpected, real-world commit data.  Shaking out bugs in the conversion process <i>before</i> pushing live avoids massive headaches in the future for developers, partners, and maintainers.  If the conversion scripts could robustly handle anything we'd seen so far, we'd have greater confidence about these systems in live use.)

<h3>Problems encountered / lessons learned: full branchlist conversion</h3>
<p>
A master-branch-only conversion was good for gecko.git, but I was looking to support beagle as well.  <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/branches\">Ehsan's repo currently has all of mozilla-central's tags and branches</a>, and not only did he <a href=\"http://git.mozilla.org/?p=users/eakhgari@mozilla.com/mozilla-history-tools.git;a=blob;f=initial_conversion/README.md;h=f57d06b1706235406e15b218effba46e572e25ef;hb=3c8e758d128e42b7ce36010a4bd0d752e5f96b78#l56\">gexport each of those branches</a>, he also ran <a href=\"http://git.mozilla.org/?p=users/eakhgari@mozilla.com/mozilla-history-tools.git;a=blob;f=initial_conversion/README.md;h=f57d06b1706235406e15b218effba46e572e25ef;hb=3c8e758d128e42b7ce36010a4bd0d752e5f96b78#l106\">git filter-branch on them after the cvs prepend</a>, and <a href=\"http://git.mozilla.org/?p=users/eakhgari@mozilla.com/mozilla-history-tools.git;a=blob;f=initial_conversion/README.md;h=f57d06b1706235406e15b218effba46e572e25ef;hb=3c8e758d128e42b7ce36010a4bd0d752e5f96b78#l134\">translated each of the tags</a>.  Had I proceeded without doing this work, I could foresee a future where we would be asked to shoehorn these changes onto a live production repo, well after the downstream audience had crossed lynch-mob-levels.  Worse still, I wasn't able to push to github without running a <code>git gc aggressive</code>, which would make future conversion of these branches and tags very difficult.  I couldn't use gecko.git as the base if I wanted these branches and tags; I couldn't use Ehsan's repo as the base if I wanted the shas to match gecko.git.  It wasn't difficult for me to add this added workflow to the script, just compute-time-intensive.  So I added it, and started the full conversion at that point.
</p><p>
This took a bit longer to complete than I predicted, because I had to either use the <code>-f</code> option in <code>git filter-branch</code> and potentially overwrite revisions already created in the map directory, or not halt on failure should one of the <code>git filter-branch</code> runs exit non-zero.  Neither of these seemed like comfortable sensitive-production-service decisions to make.  (In the end, the <code>-f</code> turned out to be the lesser evil.)
</p><p>
As a side note: certainly at this point (if not before), a second machine or a fast local disk with enough inodes+space to handle a second parallel conversion would have helped speed up the process immensely, as I could have run both conversion workflows in parallel, rather than serially as I have been (with lots of tar backups and restores to try to save time).  I did finally get that second machine last week (yay!), though that was well after most of my time-consuming compute churn was over.  (I estimate that had I had this second machine at the start of the project, I would have saved at least a month of calendar time; very likely more.)  Still, I'm making good use of it now.
</p><p>
Unbeknownst to me, <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/82e4f1b7bbb6e30a635b49bf2107b41a8c26e3d2\">this seemingly innocuous commit</a> landed between my successful master-only conversion and the first full-branch conversion attempt that made it through without halting-on-failure.  During the cvs prepending step, for some unknown reason, <code>git filter-branch</code> changes \"Carlos G.\" into \"Carlos G\" sans-period; <a href=\"http://git.mozilla.org/?p=releases/gecko.git;a=commit;h=8962237ccb5c517d8a63ac681c89e758afda3bdb\">gecko.git preserves the original name</a>.  My theory was that hg-git was dealing with this user's name appropriately, and <code>git filter-branch</code> was munging it.  Enter <code>hg strip</code>: <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=847727#c54\">I theorized</a> that if I stripped the problem commit before cvs prepending, and then updated and converted via hg-git normally afterwards, we'd be golden.  And that's almost true. <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=847727#c58\">But not quite</a>.
</p><p>
The main problem, as I found out after a second full conversion (and having my conversion machine reboot from under me, which only cost me 5 compute days) pass later, is that the <code>hg strip</code> didn't leave <code>default</code> as the tip of its own branch; due to unnamed branches+merges as DVCS allows, I had to <a href=\"https://github.com/escapewindow/mozharness/blob/beagle/scripts/poc_beagle.py#L475\"><code>hg strip</code> three times</a> to get to a single tip-of-default head.  Without that, <code>git filter-branch</code> would move the <code>master</code> branch to cvs-based shas, but the additional forks stayed on the old, non-cvs-based shas.  Once I landed this change, (and once I restarted this conversion pass after the machine reboot), <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=847727#c62\">we now have a full conversion of mozilla-central</a>, with all mozilla-central branches and tags, with cvs history, with shas that match up with gecko.git.  The toolchain, config, and script have been tested against a huge number of historical revisions and held up; this is a good sign for future robustness.  A bonus side effect is we can predictably recreate our git history now, which is great, but was never the primary goal.
</p><p>
I pushed the resulting repo to this <a href=\"https://github.com/escapewindow/test-beagle\">test repository on github</a>; please feel free to poke at it (but be forewarned that I reserve the right to reset it in the future).  I <a href=\"https://github.com/escapewindow/test-beagle/branches\">started populating the repo branch list</a> to include branches that we think make the most sense given the use cases for this repo and all the gotchas described above.  During this process, I came across some things that need fixing in the code+configs (for instance, you'll note that the mozilla-central branches+tags aren't there, and the mozilla-beta+mozilla-release release tags.  I have the former in my conversion repo, and have a partial plan for the latter).  But we're definitely past the long compute time hump.
</p><p>
(As another side note -- I fixed some of these cvs prepend issues via specific revision hardcodes rather than generic solutions.  This isn't ideal; I'd love to write this tool in a way that could apply to any project, anywhere.  However, given some of the unique constraints (cvs prepending, matching previous shas that were built with a different process and toolchain), and limited time, I decided hardcodes in this section of code, which in theory should only need to be run once barring some sort of emergency, was the lesser of evils.)

<div style=\"padding: 1em;\">
<h3>Still to do</h3>
<ul><li>
From the start, even before we down-scoped the project, I was planning on being able to push a subset of repos, branches, and tags to a number of different locations.  My <a href=\"https://github.com/escapewindow/mozharness/blob/beagle/configs/users/aki/beagle1.py#L50\">configs</a> for doing that are a bit ugly currently, but they work!  So if I'm pulling <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-b2g18\">mozilla-b2g18</a> into my conversion repo, I can push the master branch of that repo to <a href=\"http://git.mozilla.org/?p=releases/gecko.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/gecko-18\">gecko.git:gecko-18</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/tree/b2g18\">beagle:b2g18</a>, and create a standalone mozilla-b2g18 repo on github or git.m.o where it's b2g18:master.  Since these would be pushed from the same conversion directory, they would be guaranteed to have the same shas.
<br /><br />
And since I've made the effort to make my code modular, config-driven, and well tested, I would have no qualms about running two instances of the script in parallel: one for gecko.git, one for beagle.  After painstaking and time-consuming effort to try to guarantee matching shas, and with the same toolchains and code paths, I wouldn't be worried about the two repos diverging.  The split would mainly serve to avoid pushing any bad changes to the more sensitive, partner-oriented gecko.git.  It's easier to guarantee a change won't be pushed if the change doesn't exist in the conversion repo at all, rather than only relying on push-time checks.
<br /><br />
Currently I'm leaning towards the split (for more stable gecko.git), with the multiple-target logic in the former living in the beagle process.
<br /><br />
</li><li>
As I was pushing the various repos to my test-beagle github repo, I <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=847727#c63\">noticed a few things about tags and branches</a>.  The <a href=\"https://github.com/escapewindow/mozharness/blob/beagle/configs/users/aki/beagle1.py#L50\">branch and tag configs</a> are not creating the {FIREFOX,FENNEC}_*_{BUILDn,RELEASE} tags, among others, even when I <a href=\"https://github.com/escapewindow/mozharness/blob/beagle/configs/users/aki/beagle1.py#L197\">changed the tag_regexes</a>.  This is probably because the release tags are all created on <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/graph/138623\">relbranches</a>, and outside of mozilla-central, I'm only converting the branches listed in an explicit branch whitelist.
<br /><br />
I imagine I need branch and tag configs for incoming branches+tags (branches and tags designated for conversion); these would need to be a superset of all branches and tags that we would want to push.  Limiting this set would help prevent pushing any unwanted branches and tags, which could prove problematic if they either violate the no-deletes or fast-forward-only rules, or if the tags in question move on the mercurial side.  A whitelist would work, but by itself would require a lot of manual intervention.  I need to add regex or wildcard support.  The outgoing branch and tag configs would be similar, but could be a subset of available branches and tags, and continue to involve different configs for different push targets (e.g., the above gecko.git:gecko-18, beagle:b2g18, b2g18:master example).
<br /><br />
Since we'll be adding to this list and modifying it on the fly when this script is in production, a config file validator and a more sane format become less optional and more production best practice.
<br /><br />
</li><li>
For <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=848908\">bug 848908 - prevent repo corruption due to bad pulls for hg-git conversion</a>, I already have three types of repos on local disk: clean staging clones, the conversion repo, and test target repos.
<br /><br />
The conversion repo is the same as gecko.git and Ehsan's repo.  The staging clones are clean clones designed to catch any hg.mozilla.org repo corruption from a pull, as noted in in the bug.  Basically, it's a matter of minutes to blow away and reclone a clean clone.  It's a matter of hours or days if we corrupt the conversion repo.
<br /><br />
I haven't caught any repo corruption yet, but I do know we've seen at least three or more instances of repo corruption in Hal's production conversion repos, each time a multi-hour restoration process, each delaying further changes from making their way downstream.  I knew that beagle, with its massively larger matrix of repos, branches, and tags, would be even harder and likely more time consuming to un-corrupt.
<br /><br />
The local disk test target repos are there to give debuggable local repos to push to.  I imagine we could set them up in such a way that they would need to pass certain tests before allowing the script to push to a public repo.
<br /><br />
To do here: catch staging clone repo corruption, and make sure the automated response deals with it appropriately; potentially add test target repo validation to avoid pushing bad commits to public repos.  I'm not sure these are blockers, but they would go a long way to making the process more robust.
<br /><br />
</li><li>
For <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799845\">bug 799845 - For git mirrored repositories, please provide status on what the last successfully sync time was</a>, I create a json file with what I think is adequate information about the latest pull/push times, and the configuration involved.  It currently looks like <a href=\"http://escapewindow.com/tmp/repo_update.json\">this</a>.
<br /><br />
I need to make sure the format works for downstream users, and find a place for this file (and the logs, etc.) to get uploaded to.
<br /><br />
</li><li>
When <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=892563\">bug 892563 - Add a timeout parameter to mozharness' run_command</a> landed, I added <code>output_timeout</code> settings to various commands I felt might hang at some point in the future; they also run through the <code>retry()</code> method, and each successful and unsuccessful run sends email (<a href=\"https://github.com/escapewindow/mozharness/blob/beagle/configs/users/aki/beagle1.py#L292\">configurable</a>, of course).  I have yet to see timeout/retry code successfully exercised; I'd love some verification before production.
<br /><br />

Split the patch up for review!

It’s help me form opinions about people, tools and processes that make teams effective at shipping software products.</p>
<p>Who makes up a software product team? Mileage may vary, but I like to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers</li>
<li>Testers</li>
<li>UX Designers</li>
<li>Project Managers</li>
<li>Product Managers</li>
<li>Support</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of companies organize people into functional groups: All the developers in a group, all the testers in a group, all the designers in a group… and so on. This doesn’t make it easy to ship software. It can create walls and make it harder to communicate. You also lose the “team” feeling, as well as the focus and drive that comes from that.</p>
<p>Product-centric teams seem to be more effective at shipping. These multidisciplinary teams embed members from the various groups on the team, all working together to create and ship a software product.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve seen productive teams using a few basic concepts. Some are process related, some can be aided by tools, but most deal with relationships between people:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trust each other:</strong> Each member has a role, and members need to trust in each other’s ability to perform.</li>
<li><strong>Talk to each other:</strong> Lots of open communication is important. The team is a safe place, so there are no stupid questions. Meet as a group often to discuss progress.</li>
<li><strong>Support each other:</strong> You win and lose together. Help others, even if not asked directly.</li>
<li><strong>Be passionate:</strong> The team needs to be passionate about succeeding and hungry to ship a great product. There will be rough spots on the way. There always are, but the team needs that passion to be able to power through.</li>
<li><strong>Move as a single, focused group:</strong> Speed is important. Decisions, implementation, feedback – all need to happen ASAP. Distractions kill speed.</li>
<li><strong>Plan work as a group and document the plan:</strong> If everyone is part of the planning, everyone is committed to the plan. Keeps the team focused.</li>
<li><strong>Create a roadmap:</strong> You need a Big Picture too. What’s the vision and strategy? It helps set the tone for everything else.</li>
<li><strong>Break work into small tasks and track the tasks:</strong> Small tasks are manageable and trackable. Small tasks are easy to scope and keeps the team focused. Watch out for scope creep.</li>
<li><strong>Create milestones and track progress:</strong> Deadlines are a good thing, even if just internal. Forward progress is essential for shipping and milestones are great for tracking progress.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust as needed:</strong> Don’t be afraid to adjust anything: schedule, milestones, tasks. You are collecting data every day. Use it to make informed decisions ASAP. Triage your work often.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like to keep things lightweight. This includes tools and processes. Focus more on your product and the work at hand. Processes and tools can be distractions. The best ones are those that stay out of your way.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/tglek/\">Taras</a> reminded me indirectly about the importance of passion, so I added it to the list.</p>" nil nil "ada413a7a9bf4ae59b69ca2f25b9d2a8") (430 (20984 50462 26440) "http://shizen008.wordpress.com/2013/07/26/b2g-compilation-error-on-mac-os-x/" "Naoki Hirata: B2G Compilation error on Mac OS X" "shizen008" "Fri, 26 Jul 2013 21:55:04 +0000" "<p>On Mac OS X 10.7 or newer, with Xcode 4.5 or newer, if you ran into this compilation error:</p>

The purpose of TRIBE is to transform the Mozilla culture by developing leadership skills across the project. (Modest, I know.) The focus of the initial session is on you – knowing your strengths, identifying your reactive tendencies, and understanding the ways in which you listen.</p>
<p>I completed TRIBE session 1 this week in Toronto. I have previously taken a good chunk of the IBM leadership and soft skills training course catalog. That is to say, I have a pretty good understanding of how this type of course is typically structured and delivered. (IBM courses are delivered by a number of different vendors.) TRIBE session 1 was something different. After the last two days I am left blown away by the extremely well put together material and delivery of this newly developed course.</p>
<p>The initial TRIBE session is a group experience but an individual journey. What I mean by that is that all of the members of this session participate in the same discussions and exercises and all have access to the same course materials. However, as this session focuses on you, your journey will be very personal and not one that will be replicated by anyone else in the program. Your takeaway thoughts and actions will be specific to you. You will succeed by building trusted allies in your course mates, who will equally rely on you for their own success. So, while I cannot tell you exactly what you will get out of this course, judging from the reactions of the people with whom I shared the last two days, I can tell you that this time looking inward will serve you well.</p>
<p>I have three suggestions for anyone who has signed up for TRIBE session 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>The strength finder assessment that you will complete before the course may not make sense to you initially. Don’t judge the strength finder assessment until after you have completed the initial TRIBE session.</li>
<li>Before attending the session spend a few minutes thinking about the where you would like your career to be in 2-5 years.</li>
<li>Before attending the session jot down the names of a few people who you admire and think would be valuable to you as mentors.</li>
</ol>
<p>When something is well done acknowledgement and thanks are in order. As such, I want to thank Debbie and the People team for developing a truly excellent course offering. I also want to thank Kate Roeske (<a href=\"http://redcarrotleadership.com\">Red Carrot Leadership</a>) and Athena Katsaros (<a href=\"http://ideatribe.com\">IdeaTr!be</a>) for doing a wonderful job facilitating our session this week.</p>
<p>As the purpose of TRIBE is to transform the Mozilla culture, <strong>TRIBE is open to all Mozillians</strong>. Course schedule and registration details can be found on the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/People:TRIBE\">TRIBE wiki page</a>.</p>

The first 5 minutes, we chit-chatted and welcomed each other to the call, while we waited for everyone to arrive. Then we quickly explained the purpose (above) and the technology so any newcomers could settle right in.
Our first activity was <a href=\"https://teach.etherpad.mozilla.org/mentors-thursday\">silent etherpad hacking</a>, a tried and true method of together brainstorming and documenting. The question was <strong>“What's your favorite experience in the last week?”</strong> I don't know if you're aware of this, but the Webmaker Mentor Community is global, so our silent etherpadding led to a diverse collection of interesting links, ideas and actions. For example:
<ul>
<li><strong>In the USA:</strong> Hive NYC Maker Ed Maker Corps interns planned and delivered  Maker Parties in NYC Summer School. http://hivemakercorps.weebly.com/</li>
<li><strong> In Germany:</strong> @empeiria <a href=\"http://popcorn.webmadecontent.org/10ry\" target=\"_blank\">played with popcorn</a>, hacked a MOOC + OER video AND made two german <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/empeiria/sets/72157634335535541/\" target=\"_blank\">Translations of Infographics for OpenBadges</a></li>
<li><strong> In Canada:</strong> Karen filed her first, second and <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=896496\" target=\"_blank\">third bug</a></li>
<li><strong> In Serbia:</strong> Michelle got emotional and wrote what we were all thinking “Favorite experience in the last week? Seeing all these familiar faces on the call!” (Others agreed :D)</li>
<li><strong> In Malaysia:</strong> Syafiq had an awesome prep meeting for Storycamp Malaysia</li>
<li><strong> In India:</strong> <a href=\"http://is.gd/X0Src8\">Maker Party in Bangalore</a> was part of Free Software Movement Karnataka. Was awesome :) <a href=\"http://is.gd/R6a2AI\">See some pictures</a>.</li>
</ul>
And there are so many more, <a href=\"https://teach.etherpad.mozilla.org/mentors-thursday\" target=\"_blank\">check them out starting at line 58</a>.
Next up, we talked about what had been frustrating lately. Along with being frustrated that the XRay Goggles are still in the shop and that <a href=\"http://thimble.webmaker.org\" target=\"_blank\">Thimble</a> has some bugs (which have been filed!), I was pleased to see that <strong>people wrote in things they would like to learn and ideas to deal with frustrations surrounding connectivity</strong>. It's really a great group, we asked for frustrations, we got solutions.
<a href=\"https://teach.etherpad.mozilla.org/mentors-thursday\" target=\"_blank\">See the Etherpad</a> at line 84 for more.
After celebrating <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/party\" target=\"_blank\">Maker Party</a> with a great share out from Amira (line 111), we talked about user testing and user feedback. We found a typo and scheduled some 1-on-1 time to talk about specific Webmaker things. Check out Lines 125 to 166.
Michelle introduced <a href=\"http://mozillafestival.org\" target=\"_blank\">Mozfest</a> and we had collective excitement over <strong>the most awesomesauce event of the year</strong>, and then we wrapped up the call with a little bit of a logistic discussion. Should we take more time for these monthly calls? Should we focus on specific themes? Check out what works and what doesn't starting on line 197.
All in all, great call! Looking forward to the next one!

Mozilla is pretty serious about wanting to increase the level of graphics capability accessible to the web on both the desktop and mobile.  As some sharp observers may have noticed, we (and by we, I mean largely Guillaume Abadie) at Mozilla <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX/WebGL2\">have been working quietly</a> on implementing the bulk of OpenGL ES 3.0 capabilities as extensions to WebGL 1 (all disabled by pref by default, for now!).  “WebGL 2”, when it’s specified, will likely just be the union of all of these extensions, but all on by default.  A WebGL 2 tied to OpenGL ES 3.0 is a big step towards exposing more modern graphics capabilities, but it’s still behind what’s current on the desktop.  What we need is a unified API on both desktop and mobile that can allow access to the maximum capabilities of each.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s <a href=\"http://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2013/07/24/kepler-to-mobile/\">announcement of Project Logan</a>, their next-generation mobile processor, is pretty exciting.  By bringing desktop-class GL 4.4 in addition to ES 2 and ES 3 to mobile, I’m hoping that it will spur the mobile industry to push the mobile graphics envelope forward, instead of stagnating for years as it did with ES2.  Having the <a href=\"http://android-developers.blogspot.ca/2013/07/android-43-and-updated-developer-tools.html\">latest version of Android support ES 3</a> is a good start, but it’s still behind what’s available on the desktop.  While having OpenGL 4.4 isn’t immediately going to help WebGL – we still need to deliver a consistent API for the web – the presence of the “desktop” API on a mobile platform blurs the line between the two.  The difference between what can be done on a traditional desktop or laptop PC vs a tablet or a smartphone is shrinking rapidly.  The difference in graphics capabilities should shrink as well.</p>
<p>Under the hood, Firefox can take advantage of the additional capabilities even if they aren’t exposed to content through WebGL.  We currently have many paths to access the various hardware acceleration APIs on different platforms.  Being able to access desktop-class GL on a mobile device will enable us to bring some acceleration paths to mobile that should make Firefox really shine on Logan-class mobile hardware.  I’m looking forward to getting my hands on a Logan-powered device and running some content through Firefox for Android!</p>" nil nil "0e24bcc6cbcd0fa2cdafb0909f813ead") (426 (20984 50462 21710) "http://work.erikvold.com/pathfinder/2013/07/26/pathfinder-storage.html" "Erik Vold: Pathfinder Storage" "Erik Vold" "Fri, 26 Jul 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "<p><a href=\"http://work.erikvold.com/jetpack/2013/07/15/do-not-use-simple-storage.html\">It is my opinion that simple-storage should not be used</a>. It is true that it is simple to use, and if you need to prototype something quickly then I would suggest using simple-storage, but if you need something professional then I would stick to my original opinion and suggest against it. When I stated this opinion I said it was because it was writing to disk every 5 minutes, and at the time I knew we could optimize that a bit which the jetpack team is working on in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=893276\">bug 893276</a>, but there are actually deeper issues with the module, that was just the most ridiculous one.</p>
<p>The module was designed to mimic localStorage, which has a synchronous API, which is always a bad sign. This means that when you first access the storage the whole file (which by design could be as much as 5MB with default settings) is read from disk, meanwhile blocking the main thread until this reading is complete. This is not fixable and will not change due to the synchronous API design. The second issue is the default limit of 5MB, <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/#disk-space\">it’s a completely arbitrary decision</a> made by Ian Hickson from Google which we merely followed.</p>
<p>So I promised I would make a sane alternative in the <a href=\"https://github.com/erikvold/addon-pathfinder\">Add-on Pathfinder</a>, and I’m ready to present that to you now. I’ve simply called the module <code>storage</code> and it is completely async, it has no size limit, and it will simply save a string blob.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>let storage = require('pathfinder/storage');
let originalData = JSON.stringify(myData);
let savePromise = storage.set({ data: originalData, charset: 'UTF-8' });
savePromise.then(function({ data: dataSaved }) {
let fetchPromise = storage.get({ charset: 'UTF-8' });
fetchPromise.then(function({ data: dataFetched }) {
console.log(dataSaved == dataFetched); // true
console.log(dataFetched == originalData); // true
});
});</code></pre>
<p>Clearly it’s not as simple to use as simple-storage, but it is easy, and it is async so it will not block the main thread no matter how much data you choose to use, and therefore the UX will be far better.</p>" nil nil "656522903322e12cfb9d09935cdfa30b") (425 (20984 50462 21172) "http://work.erikvold.com/2013/07/26/on-the-fallacy-of-design.html" "Erik Vold: On The Fallacy Of Design" "Erik Vold" "Fri, 26 Jul 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "<p>Good design is not made, it is enabled. In other words design is not constructed from the top down, but instead it is made possible from the ground up.</p>
<p>The watch is not constructed by the watchmaker in a vacuum, the watchmaker does not invent the atoms with which the watch is made, nor does he invent the combination of atoms in to molecules, nor molecules in to compounds, and so on. The watchmaker merely picks from the materials available to him, which make the watch possible, and develops the watch from those pieces. He is merely picking a wise combination choice from the entropy that was made available.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the greatest designs were not constructed, but enabled. It is equally easy to see that some of the poorest designs were constructed and not enabled. Let’s look at economics, since I am interested in the subject at the moment.</p>
<p>Every learned person knows that Capitalism was not designed by anyone, it developed from the ground up, out of the development of tools came the concept of possesions, out of possessions came the concept of trade, and out of trade came Capitalism. Communism on the other hand was constructed out of a concept called morals which is an equally if not worse designed concept, which was developed out of emotions, which our brains have developed haphazardly in the vacuum that is in our skulls.</p>
<p>Note carefully that I have not said that all ground up designs are good ones, that is certainly not the case, in fact the majority of bad designs are ground up, merely because of the nature of entropy. I said that good designs are wisely selected from the ground up, and those designs made in a vacuum are always, or nearly always failures.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of Mozilla’s products from the past (this is a blog called Voldzilla after all), and see if we can’t use this way of thinking to explain why the bad designs were bad, and why the good designs were good.</p>
<p>I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, but that is probably unavoidable if we allow our emotions to rule us, something I am no less guilty of than anyone else. I am not trying to pick on individuals here, I admire everyone that I work with, my goal is merely to point out the fallacy of design, so that we made avoid it and create better products and be more productive.</p>
<p>Ubiquity started out as a product that was enabled by great designs that existed before it, it took the concept of command line tools, the internet, web service apis, web technologies like HTML + CSS and JavaScript, and Firefox add-ons to make a product that blew my mind and many others, it was an example of fantastic design. Then the concept of Natural Language Processing was slapped on and the product fell apart, perhaps more quickly than it materialized.</p>
<p>Languages were made from the ground up, trying to pretend that we can write a program with a top down approach to combine all of these languages was an idea made in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Jetpack took successful concepts from UserScripts, Add-ons, CommonJS, and Ubiquity to make a product that is extremely well designed, but the product has stagnated due to the desire to shove ever more concepts in to the products.</p>
<p>Designing Jetpack to be the end all replacement for old school add-ons which solves all of our issues with current add-ons is an idea made in a vacuum which could kill the project. One day it may be the stepping stone we need to make such a product, but that golden product cannot be designed in a vacuum, we have to build the pieces that enable us to get there first.</p>
<p>UserScripts have been a major success, almost all major browsers have adopted them, not daring to leave all of the glory to Firefox. They are a great example of ground up design. No one designed them in a vacuum, the pieces that were needed were put in to place long before the idea was hatched. Pieces like the internat, browsers, web sites, JavaScript, then volla, UserScripts! The design was enabled long before it was wisely selected.</p>
<p>UserStyles have largely the same story as UserScripts, the former having been developed after the latter.</p>
<p>FirefoxOS has uses ideas from existing smart phones, old flip phones, Linux, Firefox, and various Web technologies to produce a product from the ground up. There are many problems for which we do not have answers, which is a good sign that the product was not been designed from the top down, but it is instead being designed from the ground up, enabled by hardware advances, and existing software. This is why I predict that it will be a success, assuming a designer does not layer something designed in a vacuum in to the product which could very well kill it, like some fancy payment system, or a super cloud.</p>
<p>Well I hope this has been enough to convince you that designing from top down is at least not as useful as it would be from the ground up, I often see the former being enacted, and inevitably failing, and the blame being cast on to non-belivers, poor marketing, or claiming that the true vision was never actually tried, when the true source of the fault is very clearly the source of the design itself, a vacuum.</p>
<p>Good design is not constructed in a vacuum, it is enabled, choose your methods wisely young designers.</p>" nil nil "4ba4e89d8eeceb12ac3244a8c0b010ab") (424 (20984 50462 20170) "http://oduinn.com/blog/2013/07/25/infrastructure-load-for-june-2013/" "John O'Duinn: Infrastructure load for June 2013" "John" "Thu, 25 Jul 2013 22:24:11 +0000" "<ul>
<li><strong>#checkins-per-month:</strong> <strong>We had 5,893 checkins in June 2013</strong>. This is down from last month’s 6,041 checkins, and down from our record of 6,433 in Mar2013. Some of this reduction is because of changes made to how we count checkins on gaia-* branches (see details below), and some of this reduction feels possibly like summer-vacation-after-big-1.0-deadline.<br />
<br />
<a href=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_06_trend.png\"><img align=\"center\" alt=\"Overall load since Jan 2009\" src=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_06_trend.png\" width=\"440\" /></a> <p></p>
</li><li><strong>#checkins-per-day:</strong> We had <strong>309 checkins</strong> checkins on 18jun. During June, 20-of-30 days had over 200 checkins-per-day – thats every working day, if we include Monday 03jun which had 199! Only 11-of-30 days had over 250 checkins-per-day, which is lower than usual.
</li><li><strong>#checkins-per-hour:</strong> Checkins are still mostly mid-day PT/afternoon ET. For 7 of every 24 hours, we sustained over 10 checkins per hour. Heaviest load time this month was 2pm-3pm PT (12.6 checkins-per-hour), and 1pm-2pm PT (12.5 checkins-per-hour).
</li>
<p>As usual, our build pool handled the load well, with >95% of all builds consistently being started within 15mins. Our test pool continues to improve. All the hard work by RelEng, ATeam and IT is paying off, we’re seeing more test jobs being handled with better response times. The peak for June was 47,154 test jobs on 26jun. Still more work to be done here, but very encouraging. </p>
<p>As always, if you know of any test suites that no longer need to be run per-checkin, please let us know so we can immediately reduce the load a little. Also, if you know of any test suites which are perma-orange, and hidden on tbpl.m.o, please let us know – thats the worst of both worlds – using up scarce CPU time and not being displayed for people to make use of. We’ll make sure to file bugs to get tests fixed – or disabled – every little bit helps put scarce test CPU to better use.
</p></ul>
<p><strong>mozilla-inbound, birch/b2g-inbound, mozilla-central, fx-team:</strong><br />
Ratios of checkins across these branches remain fairly consistent. mozilla-inbound continues to be heavily used as an integration branch, increasing slightly to 24.9% of all checkins, yet still consistently far more then all other integration branches combined. mozilla-central increased slightly to 2.4% of checkins.</p>
<p>The “birch as b2g-inbound” experiment continued to be a great success, and with 7.2% of this month’s checkins landing here, birch has now become the 3rd busiest branch (after try, and mozilla-inbound). Birch is also helping reduce pain of any mozilla-inbound closures, and further proving the lure of sheriff-assisted-landings to developers. With other interrupts now handled, RelEng has now resumed work on <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875989\">bug#875989</a> to set up “b2g-inbound” on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>The lure of sheriff assistance continues to be consistently popular, and as usual, very few people land directly on mozilla-central these days. </p>
<p>The fx-team branch remained constant at 2.1% of checkins this month.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><a href=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_06_pie.png\"><img align=\"center\" alt=\"Infrastructure load by branch\" src=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_06_pie.png\" width=\"340\" /></a></p>
<p><strong>mozilla-aurora, mozilla-beta, mozilla-b2g18, gaia-central:</strong><br />
Of our total monthly checkins:</p>
<ul>
<li> 1.6% landed into mozilla-aurora, about the same as last month.
</li><li> 1.0% landed into mozilla-beta, slightly lower than last month.
</li><li> 1.3% landed into mozilla-b2g18, slightly lower then last month.
</li></ul>
<p>Note: gaia-central, and all other gaia-* branches, will not be counted here anymore. We made some changes in late May / early June to all gaia branches; one disabled running gaia-ui tests, another allowed us to generate gecko+gaia every time a more frequent gecko change landed, and also display on tbpl the exact gaia changeset used. This simplified developer+sheriff regression hunting, and also reduced confusion amongst developers. It also allowed us to stop generating unneeded builds on gaia-* branches, which in turn reduced our infrastructure load. Because of this, it doesnt make sense to continue counting checkins on gaia-* in the context of this blogpost, just like we don’t count checkins on l10n repos. I also note that these changes for gaia-* since 28may explains why the May checkin load was a little lower then originally expected. (thanks to catlee, hwine, nthomas and zeller for their help on this.)</p>

<p><strong>misc other details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pushes per day</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can clearly see weekends through the month. Its worth noting that we had >200 checkins-per-day almost every working day in June. This has been true for a few months now, so it is starting to feel like 200 checkins-per-day is the new “normal” for a working day at Mozilla. <a href=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_06_pushes.png\"><img alt=\"#Pushes this month\" src=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_06_pushes.png\" width=\"400\"\" /></a>
</li><li><strong>Pushes by hour of day</strong>
<ul>
Mid-day PT is consistently the biggest volume of checkins, specifically between 1pm-2pm PT, with 12.5 checkins-per-hour, and 2pm-3pm PT, with 12.63 checkins-per-hour. Its interesting to see load spreading out across the day, with 7-of-24 hours (8am-2pm PT) having over 10 checkins-per-hour.

We like logging things. Logging to console, to files, to syslog, maybe even sending some over email. Formatting our logging is pretty fun. Oh, the colors! Of course, we must colorize our logs. Or not, if your colorist. But there’s a problem with logging. There is? Yup. We can’t agree how everything should log its logs.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this from two levels: <strong>libraries</strong> and <strong>apps</strong>.</p>
<p>If you follow The Node Way, then you make and use focused packages or libraries from npm to accomplish specific tasks. Sometimes, those tasks need to tell the developer what happened, or otherwise record for eternity their minor quibbles. So we end up with libraries that want to log things.</p>
<p>The modules are no good without plugging them together to make an app. Many apps are web apps, but they could be anything, like flying nodecopters or some such. So you have a bunch of app specific code tying together libraries, and you want to log all over the place. You want to know response codes, response times, when errors occur, when people attack your app, and when unicorns invade.</p>
<h3>So what’s the problem?</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, you want to ship an app. We all ship apps. And while you were devving away on your machine, logging to console was perfectly fine. But once you start shipping, you can’t just watch the console blast by on hundreds of production machines like The Matrix. This is typically when you decide that you need a configurable logging library, so you can rotate log files, send some to syslog, email exception logs, and fill them full of colors.</p>
<p>To use a real example, we’ll play with <a href=\"https://npmjs.org/package/winston\">winston</a>. To use winston, we create a logger, specify some transports, and then pass the logger all over the application.</p>
<pre><code>const winston = require('winston');
var logger = new (winston.Logger)({ transports: [
new (winston.transports.File)({
filename: '/var/log/app.log',
colorize: true
}),
new (winston.transports.Console)({ colorize: true })
] });
module.exports = logger;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, elsewhere, you would require that module we just defined, and log stuff.</p>
<pre><code>const logger = require('./lib/logger');
logger.info('blast off');
</code></pre>
<p>This works for a while in your own app, but you’ll notice that you can’t make any of your dependencies use your logger. It’s also pretty terrible when you decide you want to uplift one of your <code>lib</code> modules into a standalone package. You realize you still want the logging messages, but now you can’t depend on the app giving you a logger. There goes another unicorn.</p>
<p>We’re never going to agree on a library that all apps and libs should use, and we shouldn’t! Competition, blah blah, etc. I’ll walk through probably the most obvious solution, show why it’s not good enough, and then propose the real solution.</p>
<h3>Log, log, pass?</h3>
<p>Libraries could accept a logger option. This works fine when the library provides a constructor. It’s terrible when the library simply provides a handful of static utility functions. Those that do have constructors could allow a <code>logger</code> option, but default to <code>console</code>, and still benefit from the real solution below.</p>
<p>I propose, instead, that all libraries just use <code>console.log</code> and logging libraries overload <code>console.log</code>. Well, clearly, overload all of <code>console</code>. Craziness? Maybe, but then we already get paid to write JavaScript.</p>
<h3>console.log()</h3>
<p>In node.js, the <code>console</code> object comes with <code>debug</code>, <code>log</code>, <code>info</code>, <code>warn</code>, and <code>error</code> methods already. So a library can depend on this universal global, and log things at the correct levels. The application, at the main module, can create a fancy pants logger, and overload <code>console</code> with it. Now, all library code is pumping its logs through your fancy pants, and is none the wiser. How fancy.</p>
<p>Here’s how we’d do that with our winston logger:</p>
<pre><code>const winston = require('winston');
var logger = new (winston.Logger)({
// transports and whatever loggy stuffs
});
logger.extend(console);
var log = console.log;
console.log = function hijacked_log(level) {
if (arguments.length > 1 && level in this) {
log.apply(this, arguments);
} else {
var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
args.unshift('debug');
log.apply(this, args);
}
}

Note that this patch depends on signed integer overflow behavior in C++,
which I believe is portable despite being unspecified.

This is an edited version of my speaking notes for <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/selenamarie/what-open-source-community-can-do-for-teachers\">the keynote I gave</a> at the <a href=\"http://csta.acm.org\">Computer Science Teachers Association</a> conference. This is the best distillation of my thoughts about the value of open source in my life, and what motivates me to contribute and teach. The first half is over 2000 words, so I’m breaking this into two posts. The next part I publish will be the second half of the talk – about the classes I’ve taught, and my lessons learned about what people need to know to get started in free and open source software.</em></p>
<p>I am a beginner teacher. I’ve only just started writing lessons and teaching classes to adult women who are learning or practicing their programming. All of what I share today is based on my personal experiences working with first time, adult programmers. My plan today is to tell you a little bit about me and what motivates me to teach and contribute to open source, share with you the successes of some of our beginner adult programming efforts and finally what I think open source communities offer teachers.</p>
<p>And I want to start by giving away my punchline. When it comes to working with open source community – of which I’m a member and a leader, and there are many, many leaders without any kind of central authority – I can say for sure today that we’ll come to you.</p>
<p>I’ve been working for the past couple years to find like-minded open source community members, and for those of you in the audience today, I am making a commitment to you – if you want it – to find an open source person to come and talk about what it is that they do to your classroom.</p>
<p>Just <strong>contact me</strong> (you can leave a comment below – just indicate if you’d prefer I not make your comment public), and I will make this happen, either through Mozilla or through my open source collaborators. I’ve spent the last 16 years going to conferences, and I would like to introduce that network of people to you.</p>
<p>I want to start with <a href=\"http://julieannhorvath.com/2013/07/09/a-different-perspective.html\">something Julie Horvath said recently</a>. She wrote a blog post about women in tech and it struck such a chord with me. The first sentence really stopped me dead in my tracks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn’t grow up thinking I could do anything I wanted to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I look at this again, I feel overwhelmed by how much it matches what the women I’ve taught said that they think about programming.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.31.27-AM.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-07-25 at 5.31.27 AM\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4930\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.31.27-AM-300x225.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>
<p>I see this every time I walk into a classroom to teach beginning programmers. This is a photo from a class on algorithms, people doing a pen and pencil exercise in groups. Several women said afterward they finally felt confident that they could explain what algorithms were. That before coming and working on this in these groups, they literally had never really thought about how algorithms related to programming or what it might mean to implement or create their own algorithms.</p>
<p>I’ve come to think of this as a <strong>possibilities problem</strong>. People truly have no idea what is possible for them in computer science. And in my teaching experience in particular, many women coming to these classes have a very limited view of what they can accomplish. They don’t know what the job opportunities are, they don’t realize how programming can be used in their lives outside of work, and they know very little about how a computer works or what the main components of a computer are.</p>
<p>When I think about what I really need to do — what my focus is in teaching that I do — I think about changing the scope of what people think is possible. Broadening the scope, and enhancing whatever details I can that make studying programming and ultimately computer science relevant to the lives of the people coming to these classes.</p>
<p>So if we were to just to attach a little overdeveloped importance to this idea of expanding the scope of possibility, we could call this “possibility engineering.”</p>
<p>In my experience, there’s two basic things I have to do – I need to <strong>raise awareness</strong>, and then I need to <strong>offer encouragement</strong>. It’s in addition, of course, to teaching real skills that people need. And as classroom teachers, you’re all aware of the need for these two things. I’ve found that these issues are often left out of how outreach and teaching in open source communities is structured.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.09.46-AM.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-07-25 at 5.09.46 AM\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4921\" height=\"224\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.09.46-AM-300x224.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>
<p>This is a picture of a sticky note I drew of how I felt while learning to use a new programming language or trying learn a new module in Python. The top of the graph is “euphoria” or “happiness”, and the bottom of the graph is “despair” or unhappiness. You can see I have a lot of ups and downs!</p>
<p>The peaks are when I’m reading documentation for the first time, succeeding with experiments and implementing code. The valleys are when I actually try the tutorials and they don’t completely work, when I write code that fails and when I’m trying to refactor my test suite. In the end, my emotions level out and if I’m lucky, I end up satisfied with the tool I chose to work with.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.11.08-AM.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-07-25 at 5.11.08 AM\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4922\" height=\"222\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.11.08-AM-300x222.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s what I think happens sometimes with the women who come to PyLadies and then never come back. They initially are very happy, but then something happens that causes them to give up.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.11.51-AM.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-07-25 at 5.11.51 AM\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4923\" height=\"222\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.11.51-AM-300x222.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>
<p>In one case, I know exactly what happened — a woman attended the workshops, tried things on their own that didn’t work, and then finally had something break with Python on her Windows laptop and she never came back.</p>
<p>What happens when PyLadies succeeds? What does the emotional graph look like?</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.12.49-AM.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-07-25 at 5.12.49 AM\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4924\" height=\"221\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.12.49-AM-300x221.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>
<p>What I’ve seen in the 60+ women that keep coming to meetings is that they continue to have difficult experiences – things break, they don’t know how to fix them.</p>
<p>But they all come back to the group. They ask questions, they commiserate over things that don’t work and they get the help they need to see that they are improving at the same time as they <em>feel</em> as though they are getting better, making friends and being supported. The in-person experiences are key.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.13.48-AM.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-07-25 at 5.13.48 AM\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4925\" height=\"217\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.13.48-AM-300x217.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>
<p>Before we go on, it’s important to acknowledge a key truth about what it is that teachers are teaching. Computer Science is a way of thinking and solving problems. It’s not a company or a product.</p>
<p>This is of course obvious to all of you in this room – but it’s such an important idea to come back to to in all of our work. It’s about getting kids or adults to understand the basics of what a computer is and what it does, and how it stores data about what, where, how and when we do things. We need people to understand these concepts in the same way that we need people to be able to read. When our society is increasingly assisted, augmented and controlled with the help of computers, democracy is at stake when most people have no idea how a computer and software works.</p>
<p>The role of open source groups like PyLadies, of non-profits like Mozilla, is ultimately to empower people: to spread knowledge, dispel myths and invite exploration.</p>
<p>But these groups are mostly helping out people who are already out of high school.</p>
<p>There’s a fair amount of research at this point about what many people think about computers when they’re in high school. I’ve mostly read about what girls think, and try to keep that in mind when I’m advertising my courses. Which brings me to what I thought computer science was all about when I was in high school.</p>
<p>What I knew was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computers were for playing games </li>
<li>Computers were for anti-social boys </li>
<li>You’ll find lots of inappropriate, animated ASCII art on computers</li>
</ul>
<p>And I think that highlights a problem with how we’re collectively handling explaining computer science to the world. We can’t rely on ad-hoc self-education, or discovery learning to help people understand how the whole world is changing.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.16.37-AM.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-07-25 at 5.16.37 AM\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4926\" height=\"208\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-25-at-5.16.37-AM-300x208.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s a list of job titles from my colleagues in the industry. Many of these are jobs that didn’t exist 20 years ago, some are jobs that didn’t exist five years ago. So much is changing so fast.</p>
<p>Despite that, we have some real principles – computer science principles – underpinning it all. That’s where we need to focus, while at the same time exposing people to this wealth of possibility.</p>
<p>So, how did I, a person who thought the computers were for gaming, for boys and probably a little bit seedy, get from there to thinking it might be possible to join an open source community and move on to actually changing something I cared about?</p>
<p>In 2000, I made <a href=\"http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/forum.en.html#nabble-td1061184%7Ca1061193\">my first contribution to an open source project</a>. I was working at Intel, managing network equipment monitoring and I’d found a problem with how I’d set everything up and needed to modify something like 7000 files to fix it. So I wrote a simple script.</p>
<p>Not too long after that, someone else had a similar problem and posted about it to a mailing list. So I decided, I might as well help that guy out and post the script. Then, I did.</p>
<p>And what happened next totally changed my life. The maintainer of the project not only thanked me, and asked a bunch of questions, he accepted my patch committed it to the main repo, and added me as a contributor to the project’s site.</p>
<p><img alt=\"Mind Blown\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/T4BrSwO.gif\" /></p>
<p>I changed the source code of a tool I used every day.</p>
<p>I felt deliciously powerful, so important! And incredulous that something that I’d written that was so obviously terrible, was good enough to be part of a piece of software that I not only used every day, but thought was incredibly great.</p>
<p>And other people used it! I know because I got bug reports later.</p>
<p>Today, I’m a major contributor to the <a href=\"http://postgresql.org\">PostgreSQL</a> community, and I founded a chapter of PyLadies in Portland. I’m also deeply involved in many aspects of open source community organizing, like running conferences and helping out with the Ada Initiative. It’s hard to understate how much that patch affected the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I’m super passionate about open source software and I really think collaborating with teachers is awesome. And what I think in particular is great about collaboration between us is getting the open source community to understand teaching at scale. By that, I mean learning how to teach everyone — the way that we teach in our public education system.</p>
<p>Public education is a grand experiment, and a very successful one. Despite the many issues we have with the administration of it, we have a literacy rate that enables us to sustain a democracy and a system for getting an incredible amount of information to most of our republic’s citizens.</p>
<p>We should be using this system to teach everyone about computer science.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I want open source communities to figure out how to teach at that kind of scale. Not only do we need computer science in the classrooms — we need free and open source principles and tools to be taught as well.</p>
<p>We can get there with community members reaching out to teachers as a first step.</p>
<p>And an important part of that is learning what the process of developing lessons and teaching students in classrooms is all about. This is the huge thing we (free and open source developers and community members) can learn from you (teachers).</p>
<p>Teachers and open source community have a lot in common. Some of the more important things are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal resources</li>
<li>Teach anyone who shows up</li>
<li>Change the world by sharing ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>My dream in this is that we’ll find a way to provide effective computer science education for everyone.</p>
<p>We’re trying to find that minimal set of concepts that will make people feel empowered at a keyboard, a kiosk or any computer they interact with in their lives. That they understand what’s being said in the newspaper about computers, that they can ask questions without feeling shamed or stupid, and that they can learn more if they choose.</p>
<p>And I don’t mean at all to say that you’re all signing up for teaching everyone. But I am signing up to at least try to do this for the adults in my life that need and want it.</p>

Unfortunately at this early stage there isn’t a built-in way to back up your data from a FirefoxOS phone. I’m sure it’s on a roadmap, but as with all v1 products you have to make some tough calls when it comes to feature prioritization.</p>
<p>This tutorial provides a step-by-step walk through of how to backup and restore your contacts on a B2G or FirefoxOS phone. It’s not supported so it may stop working in the future, but for now it works <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<p>To complete this tutorial you’ll need a B2G/FirefoxOS phone, a USB cable to connect your phone to your computer, and the <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html\">Android Debug Bridge</a> installed (referred to as `adb` later in the tutorial).</p>
<p>1. Start up your FirefoxOS phone and go to Settings.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/step1.png\"><img alt=\"step1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3245\" src=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/step1.png?w=480\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; border: 4px solid rgb(34,34,34);\" /></a></p>
<p>2. Go to Device Information</p>
<p><a href=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/step2.png\"><img alt=\"step2\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3246\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/step2.png?w=320&h=480\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; border: 4px solid rgb(34,34,34);\" width=\"320\" /></a></p>
<p>3. Go to More Information</p>
<p><a href=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/step3.png\"><img alt=\"step3\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3247\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/step3.png?w=320&h=480\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; border: 4px solid rgb(34,34,34);\" width=\"320\" /></a></p>
<p>4. Go to Developer</p>
<p><a href=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/step4.png\"><img alt=\"step4\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3248\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/step4.png?w=320&h=480\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; border: 4px solid rgb(34,34,34);\" width=\"320\" /></a></p>
<p>5. Enable “Remote Debugging”. This will allow you to use ADB to pull data off of the phone.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/step51.png\"><img alt=\"step5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3256\" src=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/step51.png?w=480\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; border: 4px solid rgb(34,34,34);\" /></a></p>
<p>6. Connect your phone to the computer using the USB cable.</p>
<p>7. In your console, type `<code>adb devices</code>` to check that the phone has connected properly. You should see your phone listed as an attached device. At this point you can now use `adb shell` to browse through the system files on the phone.</p>
<p>8. Type `<code>adb pull /data/local/indexedDB/chrome/3406066227csotncta.sqlite .</code>` This will pull the contacts IndexedDB database off of your phone and in to your local working directory. If you are curious about the contents of the database, you can <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/indexeddb-browser/\">install the IndexedDB Browser add-on for Firefox</a> which will let you open up the database.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/2013-07-23_2109.png\"><img alt=\"2013-07-23_2109\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3252\" src=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/2013-07-23_2109.png?w=460\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; width: 460px; border: 4px solid rgb(34,34,34);\" /></a></p>
<p>And you are now done with backing up your contacts. If you need to reset your phone in the future, you can just follow these steps again but replace step 8 with the following: `<code>adb push 3406066227csotncta.sqlite /data/local/indexedDB/chrome/3406066227csotncta.sqlite</code>`. This will push your backed-up contacts database back on to the device.</p>

<p>These signs were spotted last week on Highway 101, right here in the bay area!

 <br />
<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/firequery/\">FireQuery</a> is a Firebug extension for jQuery development. It's a collection of Firebug enhancements for jQuery.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"305\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firequery/firequery.png\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<p><span id=\"more-780\"></span></p>
<h3>jQuerify</h3>
<p><strong>FireQuery</strong> allows you to inject jQuery into any web page. Just click the <em>jQuerify</em> button in the Console panel.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"61\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firequery/jquerify.png\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<p>You can specify your own URL in <code>about:config</code> for the key <code>extensions.firebug.firequery.jQueryURL</code>.</p>
<p><em>Note that page jQuerifying can be also done through Firebug built-in <a href=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/firebug/firebug-tip-include-command/\">include()</a> command.</em></p>
<h3>jQuery Wrapper</h3>
<p><b>FireQuery</b> also improves logs displayed in the Console panel. When you use <code>$()</code> (the one coming from jQuery) you'll see that the log is marked as being done using jQuery wrapper.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"171\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firequery/jquery-wrapper.png\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<h3>jQuery Data</h3>
<p><b>FireQuery</b> visualizes attached <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/\">jQuery.data()</a>.</p>
<div class=\"dean_ch\" style=\"white-space: wrap;\">$<span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"body\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>.<span class=\"me1\">data</span><span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"name\"</span>, <span class=\"st0\">\"Joe\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>.<span class=\"me1\">data</span><span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"age\"</span>, <span class=\"st0\">\"39\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span></div>
<p>Executing the script in a page (or on Firebug's Command Line) will associate data with the <code>body</code> element. Now if you query for the <code>body</code> element you'll see a little envelop icon attached to the result.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"162\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firequery/jquery-data.png\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<p>Clicking on the icon will navigate you to the DOM Panel where you can see/inspect all details.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"126\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firequery/jquery-data-dompanel.png\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<p>Finally, you can also use the HTML panel to see the data.</p>

Great as they are, the open up a few interesting questions. <strong>For example, what happens when you pause an animation that’s in a timing group?</strong></p>
<p>Consider the following <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/#parallel-timing-groups\">parallel timing group</a>. It has two child animations, A and B, and the group repeats twice.</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pausing-a-repeated-group-1.png\"><img alt=\"A parallel timing group with two children A and B whereby the group repeats twice\" height=\"189\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pausing-a-repeated-group-1.png\" width=\"504\" /></a></div>
<p>Suppose we pause child animation A at the red down arrow and then resume it at the red up arrow. What should happen?</p>
<p>One option is to just let everything play as normal.</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pausing-a-repeated-group-2.png\"><img alt=\"A child of the parallel timing group is paused such that all other animations continue to play as normal\" height=\"189\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pausing-a-repeated-group-2.png\" width=\"504\" /></a></div>
<p>But then what happens to the second run of A? Does it run at all? Get squashed? Get overlapped? And if so, who wins?</p>
<p>So what if we automatically unpause animation A when we hit an iteration boundary?</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pausing-a-repeated-group-3.png\"><img alt=\"A child of the parallel timing group is paused such that it is automatically unpaused when an interval boundary is reached\" height=\"189\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pausing-a-repeated-group-3.png\" width=\"504\" /></a></div>
<p>From an API point-of-view that automatic unpausing is tricky and likely to lead to bugs where a piece of script assumes an animation is paused but on some devices the interval boundary occurs before the script gets a chance to run, breaking the assumption.</p>
<p>Another approach is just to stretch the iteration to fit the pause like so.</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pausing-a-repeated-group-4.png\"><img alt=\"A child of the parallel timing group is paused such that the iteration is stretched to fill the pause amount\" height=\"189\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pausing-a-repeated-group-4.png\" width=\"600\" /></a></div>
<p>This mostly works for parallel containers but, <b>like the other behaviours, it doesn’t make sense for a sequence timing group because the sequence is broken</b>.</p>
<p>Also, <b>all these behaviours are problematic if we seek the group whilst a child is paused</b>. And if we seek backwards after unpausing what is the expected state of the world?</p>
<p>The approach that provides the most intuitive behaviour in these situations is simply to pause the group as a whole like so.</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pausing-a-repeated-group-5.png\"><img alt=\"A child of the parallel timing group is paused by applying the pause to the group\" height=\"189\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pausing-a-repeated-group-5.png\" width=\"600\" /></a></div>
<p>This of course applies all the way up the tree.</p>
<h3>But what do other APIs do?</h3>
<p>Looking at <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/fx/wiki/Web_Animations/API_Comparison\">a number of other animation APIs</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qdeclarativeanimation.html\">QML</a> just ignores play control on animations if they’re in a group.
</li><li><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/AnimatorSet.html\">Android</a> doesn’t include repeating etc. on groups and animations and groups don’t have play control.
</li><li>In <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752312.aspx\">WPF</a> only the root clock can be interactively controlled.
</li><li>In <a href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-video-element.html#htmlmediaelement\">HTML</a>, media slaved to a controller (similar in some sense to a timing group) behaves differently to independent media. You can pause it independently, but seeking throws an exception. Pausing due to buffering pauses the controller. There is no repeating.
</li></ul>
<p>In summary, QML and WPF push pausing to the root of timing hierarchy. Android and HTML manage to do something different but only because they don’t allow groups to repeat.</p>
<p>For Web Animations, like QML and WPF, the best option is to push pausing and other play control to the root of the timing hierarchy. The trouble comes when we try to represent this in the API.</p>
<p>At first we tried to do this transparently, that is, you’d call <code>pause</code> and it would just go up to the top-level timing group and apply the pause there. However, a couple of concerns were raised with this,</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not obvious that the operation you’re performing may have wide-reaching effects.
</li><li>It doesn’t work for seeking since the time values are relative to the child not the parent. HTML just throws an exception in this case, but some people felt uncomfortable that this method would sometimes work and sometimes throw an exception depending on whether there was a parent timing group or not.
</li></ul>
<h3>Enter the players</h3>
<p>In order to emphasise the fact that play control (pausing, seeking, etc.) takes place at the root-most timing group a new concept, the <strong>player</strong>, was introduced. <b>A player plays things.</b> It’s the point of attachment between some timed content and a timeline. The arrangement is as follows.</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/time-hierarchy.png\"><img alt=\"Players form the point of attachment between the rootmost timing groups and animations and a timeline.\" height=\"547\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/time-hierarchy.png\" width=\"500\" /></a></div>
<p>From a code point of view it looks like this:</p>
<div style=\"margin-left: 3em; text-align: left; font-size: 1.1em;\"><code>
<pre>  var anim = elem.animate({ left: '20px' }, 3);
anim.player.pause();</pre>
</code><p><code></code></p></div>
<p>This separation hopefully makes it more obvious to an author that the change they are making may have more wide-reaching effects.</p>
<p>It also can make avoiding some common coding mistakes a little easier.</p>
<div style=\"margin-left: 3em; text-align: left; font-size: 1.1em;\"><code>
<pre>  // The following could cause some animations to be sped up 4, 8 times or more
elem.getCurrentAnimations().forEach(function (anim) {
anim.player.playbackRate *= 2;
});
// The following will speed everything up by a factor of 2 and no more
elem.getCurrentPlayers().forEach(function (player) {
player.playbackRate *= 2;
});</pre>
</code><p><code></code></p></div>
<p>It also has a few nice properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TimedItem.localTime</code> is always readonly and has a different name to the always writeable <code>Player.currentTime</code>.
</li><li><code>TimedItem.timing.playbackRate</code> affects the model in the same way as changing other timing parameters does including possibly causing the playback position to jump. <code>Player.playbackRate</code>, on the other hand, makes dynamic changes so that the current playback position is preserved.
</li></ul>
<p>Unfortunately, introducing the idea of players adds conceptual weight to the API. It’s probably one of the most unfamiliar concepts for people coming to the specification (hence this blog post!). For these reasons I resisted this change strongly but ultimately lost. :)</p>
<p>That said, it does make the model more consistent and therefore, to some degree, more intuitive. It is also expected that many authors will never use this functionality (jQuery, for example, does not provide pause control) and so this additional concept shouldn’t become a barrier to adoption for simple usage.</p>
<p>I’ll look forward to seeing how authors take to this concept. If you have any feedback, feel free to follow-up at <a href=\"mailto:public-fx@w3.org\">public-fx@w3.org</a> with subject <q>[web-animations]</q>.</p>
<h3>Upcoming changes</h3>
<p>Recently we’ve been discussing some changes to the way players work. Currently they just keep playing forever but we think it might make sense for them to behave more like a VCR and stop when they hit the end of their media. This would allow us to define a <code>reverse()</code> method that behaves sensibly and perhaps make players <code>then</code>-able.</p>
<p>You can see some of the discussion in <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fx/2013JulSep/0009.html\">the minutes from our recent telcon</a>, item 6, <cite>Making players stop</cite>.

(the UI layer of Firefox OS) by using L20n.  In all presented examples, I try
to show the existing code, explain the problem from the localizers' or
developers' perspective, and suggest a solution.</p>
<h3>Declensions</h3>
<p>In Gaia's Browser app, there's an <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/c0265432b75c1586bbe0d5fd7366c680951404d6/apps/browser/locales/browser.en-US.properties#L50\"><code>about-browser</code> string</a> defined as follows
in <code>apps/browser/locales/browser</code>:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\">about-browser=About {{browserBrandShortName}}
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Problem definition</h4>
<p>In many inflected languages (e.g. German, Finnish, Hungarian, all Slavic
languages), the <em>about</em> preposition <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_government\">governs the grammatical case</a> of the
complement.  It might be the accusative (German), ablative (Latin) or locative
(Slavic languages).  Let's take Slovenian as an example.</p>
<p>In Slovenian, the ideal string would inflect the noun, like so:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\">O Firefoxu
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, since we want the name of the browser to be stored in the
<code>browserBrandShortName</code> entity, we can't modify it.  The work-around is to
inflect an auxiliary noun complement, e.g. <em>browser</em>, to give <em>About the
Firefox browser</em>.  Needless to say, this ends up being long and often
unnaturally-sounding to the native speakers.  </p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\">about-browser=O brskalniku {{browserBrandShortName}}
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>In L20n, this problem can be easily solved by defining multiple variants of the
<code>browserBrandShortName</code> entity, to match different grammatical cases of the
noun.</p>
<p>In <code>shared/branding/official/branding</code>, we can define <code>browserBrandShortName</code>
as:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><browserBrandShortName</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">nominative</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefox\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">genitive</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefoxa\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">dative</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefoxu\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">accusative</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefox\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">locative</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefoxu\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">instrumental</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefoxom\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And in <code>shared/branding/unofficial/branding</code>, we can define
<code>browserBrandShortName</code> as follows, to mean <em>Web Browser</em>:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><browserBrandShortName</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">nominative</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Brskalnik\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">genitive</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Brskalnika\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">dative</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Brskalniku\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">accusative</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Brskalnik\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">locative</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Brskalniku\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">instrumental</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Brskalnikom\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, coming back to <code>apps/browser/locales/browser</code>, we can take advantage of
the grammatical cases.  Slovenian uses the locative case with its <em>About</em>
preposition:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\"><aboutBrowser \"O {{ browserBrandShortName.locative }}\">
</code></pre></div>
<p>For the official branding, we get:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\">O Firefoxu
</code></pre></div>
<p>And for the unofficial branding, we end up with:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\">O Brskalniku
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Genders</h3>
<p>In the System app's <code>apps/system/locales/system</code>, there's a string called
<a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/c0265432b75c1586bbe0d5fd7366c680951404d6/apps/system/locales/system.en-US.properties#L190\"><code>crash-banner-os2</code></a>.</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\">crash-banner-os2={{brandShortName}} just crashed.
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Problem definition</h4>
<p>In some languages, past participles (<em>crashed</em>) must be accorded with the
gender of the subject (in case of reflexive verbs) or the gender of the object.  </p>
<p>In Polish, the grammatical form of <em>crashed</em> depends on the gender
of <code>brandShortName</code>.  In order to construct a grammatically-correct and
naturally-sounding message, we must know the gender of the subject.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>In L20n, the localizer can define the gender (or, in fact, any arbitrary trait)
as an attribute of the entity.  </p>
<p>For Polish, we can define <code>brandShortName</code> in <code>shared/branding/official/branding</code> as:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><brandShortName</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Firefox OS\"</span>
<span class=\"nv\">_gender</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"masculine\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>

<span class=\"p\">});</span>
<span class=\"p\">},</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Problem definition</h4>
<p>For all values of <code>freeSpace</code>, the following string is enough to construct
a grammatically-correct sentence in English:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\">availableSize = {{size}} {{unit}} available
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, other languages might need to pluralize this string with different
forms of the <em>available</em> adjective.  Consequently, using the existing
localization frameworks, the developer needs to predict which strings might
need pluralization in other languages, and <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/edb1dea8b45238add44b199cf02c9b4ed808b767/apps/settings/locales/settings.en-US.properties#L491-L497\">pluralize them even in English</a>:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\">availableSize = {[ plural(size) ]}
availableSize[other] = {{size}} {{unit}} available
</code></pre></div>
<p>An Italian translation might look like this:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\">availableSize = {[ plural(size) ]}
availableSize[one] = {{size}} {{unit}} disponibile
availableSize[other] = {{size}} {{unit}} disponibili
</code></pre></div>
<p>It's easy to imagine how developers might forget to pluralize some strings that
in other languages might require pluralization (or other grammatical features
that the framework supports).</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>L20n isolates each language so that grammatical requirements of one don't
affect others.  This takes the responsibility away from the developers and puts
it in the hands of localizers, at the same time transforming it from a burden
into an opportunity.</p>
<p>In L20n, the English string could be as simple as:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\"><availableSize \"{{ $size }} {{ $unit }} available\">
</code></pre></div>
<p>On the other hand, the Italian translation would make use of proper
pluralization rules:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$n</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">$n</span> <span class=\"nb\">== </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"nv\">?</span> <span class=\"s\">\"one\"</span> <span class=\"err\">:</span>
<span class=\"s\">\"other\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
<span class=\"nv\"><availableSize</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$size</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">one</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ $size }} {{ $unit }} disponibile\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">other</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ $size }} {{ $unit }} disponibili\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So far, so good.  The JavaScript code hasn't changed yet, but there's another
improvement that can be introduced, which is described below.</p>
<h3>Asymmetry</h3>
<p>The example above could benefit from another of L20n's features:  local
variables.  In L20n, localization files can be asymmetrical and have more
entities that the source language.</p>
<p>You'll notice that <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/edb1dea8b45238add44b199cf02c9b4ed808b767/apps/settings/js/utils.js#L182-L197\"><code>DeviceStorageHelper.showFormatedSize</code></a> passes
a localized name of the unit to <code>availableSize</code>:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\"><span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">showFormatedSize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">element</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">l10nId</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">size</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// …</span>
<span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">_</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">navigator</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">mozL10n</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">get</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>
<span class=\"nx\">element</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">textContent</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">_</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">l10nId</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nx\">size</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">sizeInfo</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">size</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
<span class=\"nx\">unit</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">_</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'byteUnit-'</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"nx\">sizeInfo</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">unit</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Problem definition</h4>
<p>Even though there's no need to localize the units in English at all, we <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/edb1dea8b45238add44b199cf02c9b4ed808b767/apps/settings/locales/settings.en-US.properties#L485-L489\">still
need to do it</a>, because in other languages we might need to use localized
names.</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\">byteUnit-B = B
byteUnit-KB = KB
byteUnit-MB = MB
byteUnit-GB = GB
byteUnit-TB = TB
</code></pre></div>
<p>For example in French, the unit abbreviations are as follows:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\">byteUnit-B = o
byteUnit-KB = Ko
byteUnit-MB = Mo
byteUnit-GB = Go
byteUnit-TB = To
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>In L20n, the French localizer could provide the translation of unit
abbreviations locally in the localization file, without impacting the English
localization file.</p>
<p>In the JavaScript code, the developer needs to pass <code>sizeInfo.unit</code> instead of
a localized value:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\"><span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">showFormatedSize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">element</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">l10nId</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">size</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// …</span>
<span class=\"nx\">element</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">textContent</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">l10n</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">get</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">l10nId</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nx\">size</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">sizeInfo</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">size</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
<span class=\"nx\">unit</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">sizeInfo</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">unit</span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And then use the <code>$unit</code> variable verbatim in the English message:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\"><availableSize \"{{ $size }} {{ $unit }} available\">
</code></pre></div>
<p>In French, the localizer can then use the value of <code>$unit</code> to match it against
a translated abbreviation, like so:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\"><span class=\"nv\"><_uniteDeMesure</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">B</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"o\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">KB</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Ko\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">MB</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Mo\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">GB</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Go\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">TB</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"To\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
<span class=\"nv\"><availableSize</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Il reste {{ $size }} {{ _uniteDeMesure[$unit] }}\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, other local variables could be used to provide better and more
natural translations in French and other languages alike.</p>

<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The internet changes very quickly. When I first set up this blog, I hardly knew anyone personally who published any kind of personal update online.

Have you ever wanted to see the test results of a custom command line in try? Things like --test-manifest, --shuffle or --run-slower?
Now you can! The process isn't exactly optimized for the developer use case, but neither is it really difficult to do once you know how.
</p>
<p>
Basically, you just edit the 'testing/config/mozharness_config.py' file. Add a new key called '<test_suite>_options' and set its
value to a list containing the <b>full command line</b> you want to pass into the test suite. Substitute '<test_suite>' with the
name of the test suite (e.g mochitest, reftest, xpcshell etc). It's important to note that there is no way to simply extend the
official list, doing this will replace the original list wholesale.
</p>
<p>For example, lets say I wanted to add the --shuffle option to all mochitests, my diff would be:</p>
<pre>diff --git a/testing/config/mozharness_config.py b/testing/config/mozharness_config.py
--- a/testing/config/mozharness_config.py
+++ b/testing/config/mozharness_config.py
@@ -20,9 +20,15 @@ mochitests.

You must also provide the complete command line to avoid errors. The official
configuration files containing the default values live in:
https://hg.mozilla.org/build/mozharness/configs
\"\"\"

config = {
# Add custom mozharness config options here
+    \"mochitest_options\": [
+        \"--appname=%(binary_path)s\", \"--utility-path=tests/bin\",
+        \"--extra-profile-file=tests/bin/plugins\", \"--symbols-path=%(symbols_path)s\",
+        \"--certificate-path=tests/certs\", \"--autorun\", \"--close-when-done\",
+        \"--console-level=INFO\", \"--setpref=webgl.force-enabled=true\", \"--shuffle\",
+    ],
}
</pre>
<p>
There are a few limitatons to this system I want to call out.
</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to know the official options to use as a baseline for your changes. You can inspect official command lines by looking at the mozharness repo:
<ul>
<li>Windows: <a href=\"http://mxr.mozilla.org/build/source/mozharness/configs/unittests/win_unittest.py\">http://mxr.mozilla.org/build/source/mozharness/configs/unittests/win_unittest.py</a></li>
<li>OSX: <a href=\"http://mxr.mozilla.org/build/source/mozharness/configs/unittests/mac_unittest.py\">http://mxr.mozilla.org/build/source/mozharness/configs/unittests/mac_unittest.py</a></li>
<li>Linux: <a href=\"http://mxr.mozilla.org/build/source/mozharness/configs/unittests/linux_unittest.py\">http://mxr.mozilla.org/build/source/mozharness/configs/unittests/linux_unittest.py</a></li>
<li>B2G: <a href=\"http://mxr.mozilla.org/build/source/mozharness/configs/b2g/emulator_automation_config.py\">http://mxr.mozilla.org/build/source/mozharness/configs/b2g/emulator_automation_config.py</a></li>
</ul>
Note: Android doesn't currently use mozharness so this trick is not yet possible on Fennec.
</li>
<li>There is no way to specify separate command lines for different platforms. For example the mochitest command lines for B2G and desktop are very different. There is no way to specify a custom command line
for one without breaking the other. To get around this you'll just need to do two separate try pushes with two separate command lines.</li>
<li>Certain options (like --this-chunk and --total-chunks) might confuse the automation and have unintended consequences. For example specifying '--this-chunk 1' will tell every job to run the first chunk.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In conclusion, there are many things we can do to make this easier for developers. The current solution
was really implemented to allow tree specific mozharness config values, the fact that you can push custom
command lines to try was just a useful side effect. I hope in the future someone will make the developer
story around this less confusing, but I'm not sure how high of a priority it is at the moment.

<p>My pitch to the teachers was: send me an email, and I will find a free and open source community member to give a 15-20 minute talk in your classroom. Lots of teachers are taking me up on it.</p>

I’ve gotten 163 people as of 8:20am PT July 24. Thanks so much everyone! I know quite a few of the people who have filled out the form, and there are a ton of new people as well. I’m incredibly excited about this. We can all do a lot of good by actually meeting the teachers in our local areas!</p>
<p>Anyone is welcome to sign up, in any location. We have gotten volunteers from every continent except Africa so far.</p>
<p>Most of my teacher contacts are in the US, and I know a few teachers in Germany. If you know teachers who’d like speakers, I’d love to hear from you as well.</p>
<p>I’ve also started a conversation with a few developers about creating an app for connecting teachers and FOSS community members. We’ve got some code in a repo, and a couple people interested in an API for use in some neat remixing applications.</p>
<p>If you’ve got some Django or front-end experience, and you’d like to donate a little time, we’d be happy to have you join us in developing a tool for managing the contact process. I really want the introductions between people to continue to be a “warm handoff”, but it would be nice to remove me as a single-point-of-failure.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/google.png\"><img alt=\"HTTPS\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3233\" src=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/google.png?w=480\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; border: 4px solid rgb(34,34,34);\" /></a></p>
<p>Clicking on the More Information button shows how often this website is accessed, in an effort towards building trust and pointing out potentially untrustworthy websites.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/page-info.png\"><img alt=\"Page Info\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3236\" src=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/page-info.png?w=460\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; border: 4px solid rgb(34,34,34); width: 460px;\" /></a></p>
<p>When a page is viewed over a valid HTTPS connection using an Extended Validation certificate, the web browser places the certificate’s Organizational Name between the site identity graphic and the website’s URL. With Extended Validation, the web browser not only can confirm the identity of the domain that it is communicating with, but it relies on the vendor who issued the certificate to have verified the identity of the owner of the website. Again, clicking on the More Information button in the site identity panel will show prior access information.</p>

<p>Within the past couple weeks a new site identity view was introduced. Now when visiting privileged Firefox webpages such as about:home, about:config, and about:addons, the site identity area will show a Firefox logo along with the “Firefox” name. Clicking on the either of these will show a panel that confirms to the user that this page is a secure Firefox page.</p>

The working title is “PiCL”, which stands for “Profile In the CLoud”. In the coming year, this will be deployed to roughly 500 million Firefox users.</p>
<p>I’m looking for feedback on our design. It involves key-stretching (PBKDF2 and scrypt), secure handling of password-derived keys, SRP, and a healthy distrust of SSL. If you’re interested, read on!</p>
<p><span id=\"more-176\"></span></p>
<p>Unlike the previous Sync design, in which a full-strength random key was transferred between paired devices with a J-PAKE-based protocol, PiCL is obligated to use a traditional email+password as account credentials. My task has been to provide as much cryptographic protection of the user’s private data as possible, given that constraint. Our goal is to enable the user to have some data that is not visible to Mozilla (we run the servers) or their email-provider (through which a forgotten password can be reset).</p>
<p>I’m focusing on the portion of the system that gets from email+password to a pair of master keys “kA” and “kB” (described below) and a session token. There are a lot of parts you can ignore for now, like how we use kA/kB to encrypt the user’s data later (we’ll use HKDF to get per-datatype AES/HMAC keys), how BrowserID certificates authorize communication with the storage-server, and how the data actually gets synchronized (efficient delta transfer, resolving merge conflicts, etc).</p>
<p>The protocol is mainly described here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/AttachedServices/KeyServerProtocol\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/AttachedServices/KeyServerProtocol\">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/AttachedServices/KeyServerProtocol</a></li>
</ul>
<p>with some additional background here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/AttachedServices/Architecture\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/AttachedServices/Architecture\">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/AttachedServices/Architecture</a></li>
<li><a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/AttachedServices\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/AttachedServices\">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/AttachedServices</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The protocol page might be missing some context, so here’s a summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>PICL accounts are defined by an email address and a password</li>
<li>PICL will encrypt all user data, with per-datatype keys derived from either a “class-A” or a “class-B” master key (kA and kB).</li>
<li>data in class-A is recoverable, even if you forget your password: you can ask us  nicely (via the usual email-based account-reset process) and we’ll tell you kA.</li>
<li>data is class-B is not recoverable if you forget the password</li>
<li>we run a “keyserver”, which is used during signin. It knows kA and a wrapped form of kB.</li>
<li>encrypted data is stored on a “storage server”, and to control it, clients must present a BrowserID assertion, whose certificate is signed by the keyserver. The Session  Token gets you these signatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is for the confidentiality of the class-B data to be no weaker than the account password, and for this password never be revealed outside the user’s browser. If your password can’t be brute-forced, your data should remain safe, even if our keyserver is compromised. Class-A data should be no weaker than the typical “service-provider sees everything” approach. We also do a lot of key-stretching on the password, to make a brute-force attack as expensive as possible.</p>
<p>It’s supposed to reject all but the following attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>a TLS failure during initial account creation allows the MitM to offline brute-force the user’s password</li>
<li>anybody can try an online brute-force attack, rate-limited of course</li>
<li>the keyserver can do an offline brute-force attack</li>
<li>the IdP (who sees the forgot-password email) can reset the account themselves and  learn kA, but not kB</li>
<li>compromising the browser itself reveals everything, of course</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, the storage servers shouldn’t be any better off than a random stranger, to keep the security perimeter small.</p>
<p>Feel free to send comments to me, or drop by the #picl IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org (I’m “warner” on #picl), or send them to the sync-dev mailing list (<a href=\"https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/sync-dev\" title=\"https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/sync-dev\">https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/sync-dev</a>).

The worst case there is no option to change it. But the good news of an open source device is, you can actually change your Smartphone’s behavior the way you like.</p>
<p>If your Geeksphone has Bing as a default search provider and you want to change it to Google or vice-versa this post will help. All you have to do is grab the workflow set up to build Gaia, the Firefox OS user interface. In the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia\">source tree for you’ve grabbed from github</a>, find and edit the file <strong>gaia/apps/browser/js/browser.js</strong> and change:</p>
<table bgcolor=\"d6d8d4\" border=\"0\" width=\"px\">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>DEFAULT_SEARCH_PROVIDER_URL: ‘m.bing.com’,<br />
DEFAULT_SEARCH_PROVIDER_TITLE: ‘Bing’,<br />
DEFAULT_SEARCH_PROVIDER_ICON: ‘http://bing.com/favicon.ico’,</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

DEFAULT_SEARCH_PROVIDER_TITLE: ‘Google’,<br />
DEFAULT_SEARCH_PROVIDER_ICON: ‘https://www.google.com/favicon.ico’,</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>or if your default search provider is Google and you want to change it to Bing or Yahoo! or any other you want, simple do this change:</p>
<table bgcolor=\"d6d8d4\" border=\"0\" width=\"px\">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>DEFAULT_SEARCH_PROVIDER_URL: ‘www.google.com’,<br />
DEFAULT_SEARCH_PROVIDER_TITLE: ‘Google’,<br />

DEFAULT_SEARCH_PROVIDER_TITLE: ‘Bing’,<br />
DEFAULT_SEARCH_PROVIDER_ICON: ‘http://bing.com/favicon.ico’,</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>or simply replace the ‘m.bing.com to your favorite search engine. Along with the Title & Favicon.ico to complete the change as per your choice.</p>
<p>Then simply build (./build.sh gaia) and flash (./flash.sh gaia) Gaia to the phone. After the flash is complete, you should find the default search engine as per your choice.</p>

First, I worked on
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=827123\">porting the pushlog extension off SQLite</a>.
This will eventually enable Mozilla to move Mercurial hosting off NFS
and should make <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/\">hg.mozilla.org</a> much faster as
a result!</p>
<p>But the main purpose of this blog post is to introduce a new Mercurial
extension I wrote this weekend!</p>
<p>Gecko developers perform a number of common tasks with Mercurial, so I
thought it would be handy to package them up in an extension.</p>
<p>To install the extension:</p>
<pre><code>hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/hgext-gecko-dev
</code></pre>
<p>Then add this extension to your hgrc file (either the global or
per-repository will suffice):</p>
<pre><code>[extensions]
mozext = /path/to/hgext-gecko-dev
</code></pre>
<p>Since I believe tools should be self-documenting, run the following for
usage info:</p>
<pre><code>$ hg help mozext
</code></pre>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<div class=\"pygments_murphy\"><pre><span class=\"c\"># Clone mozilla-central into the mc directory.</span>
hg clone central mc
hg clone mc mc
<span class=\"c\"># Create a unified Mercurial repository containing changesets</span>
<span class=\"c\"># from all the release repositories.</span>
hg cloneunified gecko
<span class=\"c\"># Pull changes from the central and inbound repositories.</span>
hg pull central
hg pull inbound
<span class=\"c\"># Update the working tree to the tip of inbound.</span>
hg up inbound/default
<span class=\"c\"># View the tree open/closed status.</span>
hg treestatus
<span class=\"c\"># Show a list of all known trees and their aliases.</span>
hg moztrees
<span class=\"c\"># Open TBPL for the push containing a changeset.</span>
hg tbpl inbound 821e984ef423
hg tbpl inbound inbound/default
<span class=\"c\"># Push the tip of inbound to mozilla-central</span>
hg pushtree -r inbound/default central
</pre></div>
<p>I've only tested this extension with Mercurial 2.6 (which every Mozilla
developer should be running). I'm not willing to support older versions.
Upgrade already!</p>
<p>There are a number of features I'd like to implement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>hg importtry</strong> - Automatically import changesets for a Try push into
the repository.</li>
<li><strong>hg land</strong> - Automatically land patches on an integration tree (like
inbound). Will handle rebasing automatically.</li>
<li><strong>hg critic</strong> - Perform stlye checking and other analysis on a
changeset or group of changesets.</li>
<li>Ability to integrate build status into changeset info. This will allow
things such as <em>pull only the last green changeset</em>. I'd also like a
<em>build status</em> field to appear in the log output. Unfortunately, I
believe the latency of the build lookup API is prohibitively high to
perform the kind of tight integration I'd like.</li>
<li>Move <em>mozautomation</em> Python package into a standalone package or
integrate already existing code (did I reinvent the wheel?).</li>
<li>Log fetching. Specify a changeset and fetch build/test logs.</li>
<li>Possibly move code into mozilla-central.</li>
<li>Possibly add mach commands for some of this functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no bug component for this extension (yet). If you find any
issues or wish to add a feature, just email a patch to me at gps@mozilla.com.</p>

Anyone helping in debugging crashes needs to deliver crash IDs to developers, and for verifying that crash reporting works and has the correct settings, QA needs to get crash IDs as well and look at the data in those crash reports.<br />
<br />
The bug report linked above has not seen any more in 10 months though, as priorities are elsewhere for most of our developers. Also, this functionality can only be achieved via not-yet-existing APIs or via the \"apps\" DeviceStorage, which requires certified app privileges, which in turn only preinstalled core apps get and 3rd-party apps cannot get at all. The problem is that the submitted (and pending) crash reports are files in a \"Crash Reports\" directory parallel to the user profile in /data/b2g and we'd need some form of access to that.<br />
<br />
In addition, it's pretty unclear how to do a useful UI there. What I personally envision is doing a list of the date/time of the crashes and next to those put a \"share\" button that allows people to send the crash ID to a larger-screen device via email, bluetooth or whatever. We could directly link the crash reports on <a href=\"https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/\">https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/</a> in theory, but the pages there don't have a layout that looks useful on a small phone screen (right now). On future larger-screen Firefox OS devices like tablets, such a direct link will make more sense.<br />
<br />
This would be an app (or a screen of Settings, somewhere deep in the Device Information section, probably under the developer settings) that might have a few challenges in creation, but would be huge in reward as a help to improve stability of Firefox OS as a whole.<br />
<br />
Right now, people need adb to get info on the crash IDs and dates, with a command like this:<br />
<code>adb shell ls -l '/data/b2g/mozilla/Crash Reports/submitted'</code><br />
It would be much better and nicer for our work to have that available somewhere via the device's UI.<br />

<p>The Open Badges team has been sprinting on one thing or another for months now. At this point, it may be more apt to call what we’ve been doing a badge marathon rather than a series of badge sprints. And so, it’s high time for some much needed reflection and introspection. Perhaps some navel-gazing is in order. So, yeah, we’re about to participate in a team badge camp. Did I mention that it’s in Maine? Vacationland? Niiiice.</p>
<p>We probably all have ideas about summer camp: some summer-long sleep-away camps, some day camps, some great experiences, some we’d like to forget. Just like the term badges, the word camp carries a lot of baggage with it, too. (It’s a noun, it’s a verb, it’s an adjective: what can’t it do?) But we digress, let’s talk agenda.</p>
<p><strong>A time for reflection—and swimming</strong><br />
Our badge camp will be the first ever for us as a team: a week long experience packed full of sun, water, food, drink, exercise and, wait for it… badges. Well, really badge thinking. But hey, this is camp and so in addition to the prerequisite navel-gazing, we’ll also be doing some arts and crafts, too. Yes! Arts and crafts! Who doesn’t love that? And that means we’ll be making badges. Markers. Felt. Glue. Bedazzling.</p>
<p><strong>I want to wear it</strong><br />
We’ll be constructing both virtual badges and real, physical badges. Sure, this approach is a bit beyond where we started with badges—as <em>digital</em> representations of experiences, affiliations, learning. But over the last year and a half, our badge exploits and our community’s badge exploits have taught us a thing or two about physical objects. The power of the physical object cannot be overestimated. There’s something about being able to physically interact with an object—to touch it, to subconsciously weigh it, to roll it around in your hands—that turns it into not just a thing but a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talisman\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wikipedia: talisman\">talisman</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Badges as talismen</strong><br />
So as we’re combing the beach for treasures, we’ll create a few talismen of our own. These badges we create may not translate beyond next week, but the act of creating them should prove informative and will help us consider what makes a badge special and where its power might lie. Our primitive badge making will be transporting us into the world of issuers and earners, soaking us in what it means to actively participate in badge system design.</p>
<p><strong>Open Badges badges</strong><br />
Yes, there’s method behind this felt + marker + bedazzling craft-y madness. Recently our team created a questionnaire for the Open Badges team to complete. Its primary purpose? To unearth all of the hidden, unspoken, barely-floating-at-conscious-level thoughts about badges. What each member of the team thinks of them, what they’d like to see be created and issued, if there is a single badge that might represent them precisely, what excites them about badges and what makes them sad about badges. We’re diving into the unconscious world of our own hopes and dreams for badges. Our goal? To develop a way to acknowledge/recognize/appreciate/reward our badge tribe. In short, we want to make badges for and about Open Badges.</p>
<p><strong>Patterns + pathways</strong><br />
While we’re frolicking in sun and sand, we’ll be sorting through the responses to our badge questionnaire, looking for patterns. Those patterns will reveal some potential next steps—some possible pathways for recognition. But like the sand on the beach, new patterns will arise with each successive wave.  So, even after badge camp we’ll keep at it—investigating our values and our community’s values, responding to what’s most meaningful, delving into what constitutes and enhances group participation, enlarging our own understandings of badge systems—so we can create useful, compelling Open Badges badges for all.</p>
<p>Of course, I’ll keep you apprised of what we learn and what’s next. Right now, I wish you glad summer tidings.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Much more soon.</p>

It does this through events, Dev Derby, social networks… the list goes on. One thing that is in common with all of these things is that Mozilla take feedback about these engagements, as well as its products, resources… anything Mozilla really.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p><strong>Feedback, unless via blogpost (which is free-form) or in person (also free-form), tends to be via a survey (not free-form, very not free-form).</strong> This means that the people, as epic as they are, do tend to be from a subset of the community.</p>
<p>I think that this is due to how boring surveys are. They ask you lots of questions, but either don’t allow you the option to respond with, or there aren’t enough words to convey the feelings, and emotions you wish to. On top of this, there aren’t many things that bore me quicker than a page full of input fields that I have to fill in.</p>
<p><strong>Why not make the process more creative?</strong> We do after all have the skills, resources, and people power to come up with something better. Don’t we? It something I plan on proving we do have, starting with a small series of makes over on <a href=\"https://webmaker.org\">webmaker.org</a>. <strong>The aim: collect some feedback from the community at large, as well as people who wouldn’t normally consider it</strong>, all without you noticing you’re filling in a survey.</p>
<p>How am I going to manage this though? Aren’t surveys big boring forms? Is the earth not round?!</p>
<p>I’ll tell you how I intend to pull off this feat of wizardry, on the condition that you help me prove that survey’s don’t have to be big boring forms, and that the earth is indeed round.</p>
<h3>The solution?</h3>
<p>Thanks to the wonderful work of the Webmaker developers, we now have a powerful tool that sits at the heart of the new and improved <a href=\"https://webmaker.org\">webmaker.org</a>. <strong>The MakeAPI</strong>. This allows us, with properly written code, and carefully chosen tags. Find, and get, any makes in the survey. Once we have them its a simple case of extracting the feedback we wanted.</p>
<p>This does require us to spend a little more time on how we craft our questions, as well as the time it takes to create the makes, but it’s my opinion that this is time well spent if it means better, feedback. Even more worth it if the quantity of feedback increases too.</p>
<p>Now comes the part where you hold up your end of the deal. Over the weekend playtest my first Webmaker survey. Take the time to be creative, or don’t. <strong>It’s all up to you</strong> to provide the information we need to <strong>prove that surveys don’t have to be big, boring, forms,</strong> and in the process you’ll have a few more makes under your belt!</p>
<h3 id=\"complete-survey\">Completing the survey</h3>
<p>As this is no ordinary survey, I’m going to quickly run through the process.</p>
<p>This initial survey consists of 4 makes. Each one has an introductory block at the top that briefly explains the purpose of the make.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\"></pre><p>Next up comes the meta data for the make. This includes a collection of tags, that will allow us to quickly search for the completed makes, and thus get the feedback, and a thumbnail. These shouldn’t be changed if you want your make to be included in the survey.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\"><meta content=\"playtest\" name=\"webmaker:tags\">
<meta content=\"make-based-survey\" name=\"webmaker:tags\">
<meta content=\"mentor-survey\" name=\"webmaker:tags\">
<meta content=\"http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7467121/monkeys-at-work.jpg\" name=\"webmaker:thumbnail\"></pre><p>Now we get into the creative part. There are comments littered throughout the code to give you hints and ways you can remix each make. I’ve made these initial makes nice and simple so that there is lots of room to customise. Change the backgrounds, add extra information, Throw away the design and do something completely different! Get creative.</p>
<p>Finally at the end of each make there is a link to the next in the survey, and a hint at how to score some bonus points.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\"></pre><p>So what are you waiting for?! Get out there… have fun playtesting, and <strong>lets work together and prove that surveys can be fun <img alt=\":D\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/blog.wduyck.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" /> </strong></p>

I searched Bugzilla last weekend. Nothing new there. I can’t remember what this particular search entailed, but there amongst the results was <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=819930\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bug 819930\">bug 819930</a>, a Developer Tools bug about emulating CSS media types. It wasn’t the bug I was looking for, though I did read it. I could see it would be a “nice to have” for web developers, but it simply wasn’t an itch I needed to scratch. (My own CSS tweaking efforts tend to be reminiscent of <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CSS gif\">this gif</a>.)
</p>
<p>
I spent a lazy Saturday evening reading. (Currently: <em>A Distant Mirror</em> by Barbara Tuchman, after listening to an awesome episode of <a href=\"http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hh\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hardcore History\">Hardcore History</a> on the Black Death.) At one point, I found myself distracted, pondering “print preview”, which must render pages with <code>@media print</code> rules applied. Later still, another uninvited thought arrived about the <code>View->Page Style->No Style</code> menu item in Firefox. My fate was sealed.
</p>
<p><span id=\"more-246\"></span></p>
<p>
So, Sunday morning found me reading code, in an effort to put this foolish notion of fixing the bug out of my mind. Hours later, almost casually, I typed <code>hg qnew 819930_1.patch</code>, and a patch was born. It <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?changeset=0d0263a58f06\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pushlog\">landed</a> on Thursday, making this feature available in current Nightly builds. All being well, it should ship in Firefox 25.
</p>
<p>
There haven’t been any firm decisions regarding final UI. For now, it is exposed as a command in the Developer Tools command line. (Web Developers, if you are not familiar with the command line, press Shift+F2 now, and type <code>help</code> – it’s filled with useful commands!) Type <code>media emulate <type></code> to emulate a particular medium:
</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_250\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"http://www.graememcc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot-from-2013-07-19-193354.png\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of the command being typed\" class=\"size-large wp-image-250\" height=\"316\" src=\"http://www.graememcc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot-from-2013-07-19-193354-1024x558.png\" width=\"580\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">type media emulate in the command line</p></div>
<p>
and the document will be repainted:
</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_254\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"http://www.graememcc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot-from-2013-07-19-193702.png\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of the result of the GCLI command\" class=\"size-large wp-image-254\" height=\"314\" src=\"http://www.graememcc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot-from-2013-07-19-193702-1024x555.png\" width=\"580\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">BBC News: print style</p></div>
<p>
<code>media reset</code> will restore the normal rendering.
</p>
<p>
I hope web developers find this useful. As for Mozilla contributors (and prospective contributors!): don’t be so quick to dismiss bugs with a thought like “I wouldn’t know where to start implementing that”. Are you sure?

Say I sit in front of this computer, and lean slightly to my left. If you just use getUserMedia and connect the stream to a video element, this is what you get:</p>
<p><img alt=\"wrong\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3603\" height=\"240\" src=\"http://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wrong.gif\" width=\"320\" /></p>

<p>This is very simple to achieve. First of all, you need to flip the video element with <span class=\"caps\">CSS</span>:</p>
<p>
</p><div class=\"wp_syntax\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre class=\"css\" style=\"font-family: monospace;\">video <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">{</span>

<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">}</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, this is not enough, as the <span class=\"caps\">CSS</span> transformation doesn’t change the pixels of the video. In order to flip the video pixels around when you access them with <span class=\"caps\">CANVAS </span>– for example to add filter effects or <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/07/the-making-of-face-to-gif/\">generate animated GIFs</a> you also need to transform the context:</p>
<p>
</p><div class=\"wp_syntax\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre class=\"javascript\" style=\"font-family: monospace;\">  <span style=\"color: #006600; font-style: italic;\">// ctx is the plotting canvas' context</span>

Simply search for \"coach, <insert your city>\" and results will vary from the Coach brand to coaching associations. Here are five simple steps I’ve found to be the most effective for choosing a coach: </p>
<ol>
<li>Identify why you want coaching. You may be taking on a new leadership role, making a major life transition, leaning in to who and how you want to show up in the world, etc.</li>
<li>Research potential coaches. How were they trained? What references can they offer? Do they work remotely or in person?</li>
<li>Try before you buy. Set up a sample session and notice how you feel before, during and after -– without judging your feelings. Do you feel that you can trust him/her, especially with your deepest, darkest fears? Does he/she inspire or energize you? Often this will come down to your gut feel about the person.</li>
<li>Make a resonant choice. Create some space around your decision by facilitating your search in the way you make decisions best. For me, my best decisions come when I’ve done my research about the topic and the candidates, and then gathered input from as many sources as I feel I need. This process helps me to follow my gut once I’m actually engaged with someone.</li>
<li>Let the data be your guide. As you lean in with your coach and begin the work, check in after three sessions. Is he/she meeting your expectations? Be honest about why or why not, and the role you play in the dynamic. Engage in a dialogue about how it’s going and decide from there. It's unlikely you'll have made a poor choice, but if you have, both of you should be able to talk about it. If your coach can’t comfortably engage with you on this topic, there’s a clue.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />It’s also important to be clear about the role you play in the coaching relationship. Getting the most out of coaching requires what I have found to be the hallmarks of highly effective people in life overall:  </p>
<ol>
<li>The willingness to be honest with yourself and your coach about how you're really behaving and what you're choosing, whether consciously or not, with the actions you're taking.</li>
<li>The willingness to make a resonant choice about how you want to be in the world, who you want to be and to stand up for what you truly want. In other words: your BIG AGENDA. </li>
<li>The willingness to be held accountable for reaching your goals. </li>
</ol>
<p><br />To be sure, this type of self-introspection can be a bit challenging, but just as with sports training, a bit of pain will give you major gains. I recently hired a personal trainer and I love her even when I hate her –- she will not let me get away with anything! My goal may be three repetitions at a certain weight but if I can only do one or two right now, that's my reality and I want to work to overcome it. The problem is that without my trainer, I’ll still be using old habits to overcome it a year and 10 more pounds from now. It’s the same with executive coaching… a focused approach with a trusted guide will fast-track your development and ultimately your success. </p>

<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(*) Some components are currently moving away from mozStorage for performance and footprint reasons as they do not need the safety guarantees provided by mozStorage.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A long time ago, mozStorage and its users were completely synchronous and main-thread based. Needless to say, this eventually proved to be a design that <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/vdjeric/2013/01/24/add-on-performance-problems/\">doesn’t scale very well</a>. So, we set out on a quest to make mozStorage off main thread-friendly and to move all these uses off the main thread.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These days, whether you are developing add-ons or contributing to the Mozilla codebase, everything you need to access storage off the main thread are readily available to you. Let me introduce the two recommended flavors.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: This blog entry does not cover using database from *web applications* but from the *Mozilla Platform*. From web applications, you should use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB\">indexedDB</a>.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"more-1321\"></span></p>
<h3>In JavaScript, Sqlite.jsm (Firefox 20+)</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JavaScript users can access mozStorage directly but it is generally both much more convenient and much safer to use module <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Sqlite.jsm\">Sqlite.jsm</a>. This module has been introduce in Firefox 20 and upgraded in Firefox 25 with a number of performance/concurrency improvements, without change in client code.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firstly, we will import <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Sqlite.jsm\">Sqlite.jsm</a> and, to ensure that our code is easy to read, <a href=\"http://taskjs.org\">Task.jsm</a>:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">Components.utils.import(\"resource://gre/modules/Sqlite.jsm\");
Components.utils.import(\"resource://gre/modules/Task.jsm\");
</pre>
<p>We may now open (and later, close) the database:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">Task.spawn(function() {
let db;
try {
// Open a database
db = yield Sqlite.openConnection({ path: \"myDatabase.sqlite\" });
// ...
// Work with the database
// ...
//
} catch (ex) {
// Handle or report synchronous and asynchronous errors in any way you see fit
} finally {
// Don't forget to close the database or you will have bad surprises during shutdown
if (db) {
yield db.close();
}
}
});
</pre>
<p>Recall that we may use a synchronous syntax to perform asynchronous operations thanks to <tt>Task.spawn</tt>. Starting with Firefox 25, however, <tt>openConnection</tt> is executed off the main thread (by the time Firefox 25 graduates to beta, <tt>close</tt> should also be executed off the main thread, but this particular feature has not landed yet).</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the database is open, we may execute any SQL request, as follows:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">// Work with the database.
// mozStorage uses the same dialect of SQL as sqlite3.
// Create a table
yield db.execute(\"CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name INTEGER)\");
// Select content from another table
// Note parameter :domain. We give its value in a JavaScript object
yield db.execute(\"SELECT * FROM cookies_table WHERE domain = :domain\", {
domain: \"example.com\"
});
// If the statement is executed often, we will want to cache it
// for performance, as follows:
yield db.executeCached(\"SELECT * FROM cookies_table WHERE domain = :domain\", {
domain: \"example.com\"
});
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All <tt>execute</tt> and <tt>executeCached</tt> operations are executed off the main thread.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, Sqlite.jsm also supports transactions and schema management, but this is beyond the scope of this blog entry. For more details, see the full documentation of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Sqlite.jsm\">Sqlite.jsm</a>.</p>
<h3>In C++, mozIStorageAsyncConnection (Firefox 25+)</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firefox 25 introduces a new C++ API, <a href=\"http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/storage/public/mozIStorageAsyncConnection.idl?from=mozIStorageAsyncConnection.idl#l1). If you are familiar with <tt>mozIStorageConnection</tt> introduced back in Firefox 3, this API will not surprise you, as it implements a subset of <tt>mozIStorageConnection</tt>. It is, however, strongly recommended that you use <tt>mozIStorageAsyncConnection</tt> instead of <tt>mozIStorageConnection</tt>, as this new API ensures that all your mozStorage code is executed off the main thread and prevent a number of common errors (at the time of this writing, the implementation still closes databases on the main thread, but patches have been written to move this feature off the main thread and we expect that these patches will land in Firefox 25\"><tt>mozIStorageAsyncConnection</tt></a>.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Opening a <tt>mozIStorageAsyncConnection</tt> differs slightly from opening a <tt>mozIStorageConnection</tt>.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, let us import the mozStorage service:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate\">nsCOMPtr<mozIStorageService> dbService =
do_GetService(MOZ_STORAGE_SERVICE_CONTRACTID, &rv);
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {
// FIXME: Handle error;
}
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We may now open the database asynchronously:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate\">// Initialize file argument
nsCOMPtr<nsIFile> dbFile;
rv = NS_GetSpecialDirectory(NS_APP_USER_PROFILE_50_DIR,
getter_AddRefs(dbFile));
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {
// FIXME: Handle error;
}
rv = dbFile->Append(NS_LITERAL_STRING(\"myDatabase.sqlite\"));
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {
// FIXME: Handle error;
}
// Open database asynchronously
nsCOMPtr<mozIStorageCompletionCallback> onOpened = new DBOpened();
nsCOMPtr<mozIStorageConnection> dbConn;
rv = dbService->AsyncOpenDatabase(dbFile, nullptr, getter_AddRefs(dbConn), onOpened);
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {
// FIXME: Handle error;
}
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the database is opened asynchronously, we need to provide a callback to handle the<br />
result:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate\">class DBOpened: public mozIStorageCompletionCallback {

NS_IMETHOD Complete(nsresult aStatus, nsISupports* aDB)
{
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(aStatus)) {
// FIXME: Handle error
return NS_OK;
}
nsCOMPtr<mozIStorageAsyncConnection> db = do_QueryInterface(aDB);
MOZ_ASSERT(db, \"Could not QI db\");
// ...
// Work with the database
// ...
//
}
};
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As above, this database supports the dialect of SQL understood by sqlite3.</p>
<pre class=\"brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate\">// Create the statement
nsCOMPtr<mozIStorageAsyncStatement> statement;
nsresult rv = db->CreateAsyncStatement(\"SELECT * FROM cookies_table WHERE domain = :domain\",
getter_AddRefs(statement));
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {
// FIXME: handle error

// Now bind argument :domain
rv = statement->BindUTF8StringByName(NS_LITERAL_CSTRING(\"domain\"),
\"example.com\");
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {
// FIXME: handle error
}
// Execute the statement
nsCOMPtr<mozIStorageStatementCallback> onComplete = new OnComplete();
rv = statement->ExecuteAsync(onComplete);
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {
// FIXME: handle error
}
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before closing a database, you need to ensure that you hold no reference to its statements,<br />
so as to ensure that the statements are properly finalized:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate\">statement = nullptr;
rv = db->AsyncClose(nullptr); // Optionally, add a callback
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {
// FIXME: handle error
}
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, <tt>mozIStorageAsyncConnection</tt> supports transactions, but that goes beyond the scope of this blog entry.</p>
<h3>When should I use mozStorage?</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you develop code for the Mozilla Platform (either contributions to the codebase or add-ons), you need to be very careful about responsiveness. A very good way to break responsiveness is to use mozStorage on the main thread. If you need to read/write complex data and if you need a high level of safety, mozStorage is the right tool for the job and Sqlite.jsm and <tt>mozIStorageAsyncConnection</tt> are the right ways to use this tool. For simple uses of mozStorage, you may wish to use the higher-level indexedDB.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you only need to read/write simple data and if you do not need extreme safety, you should rather consider using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript_OS.File/OS.File_for_the_main_thread\">OS.File</a> to read/write all your data as json.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whatever you do, you should avoid using the preference system for anything other than preferences, and in particular for anything large or that changes often, as writing preferences is an expensive operation that is currently executed on the main thread. Moreover, adding large data to the preferences will slow down both the startup of Firefox (loading preferences become slower) and every single preferences write.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://firelogger.binaryage.com/\">FireLogger</a> implements simple yet powerful server side logging (similar to <code>console.log</code> on the client side). It creates a new panel (a logging console) in Firebug UI that displays logs coming from the server.</p>
<p>Logs are sent to the client side over HTTP headers. The extension supports <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> scripts. </p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firelogger/firelogger.png\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<p>You can dowload it from <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/firelogger/\">AMO</a>.</p>
<p><span id=\"more-759\"></span></p>
<h3>Hello From PHP</h3>
<p>Let's take a quick look at how to create a simple log in PHP script that is visible in your Firebug.</p>
<p>Download <a href=\"http://github.com/binaryage/firelogger.php\">firelogger.php</a> and:</p>
<div class=\"dean_ch\" style=\"white-space: wrap;\"><span class=\"kw2\"><?php</span><br />
<span class=\"kw1\">require</span> <span class=\"st0\">'firelogger.php'</span>;<br />
flog<span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Hello world!\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>;<br />
<span class=\"kw2\">?></span></div>
<p>This is how the log looks like in your browser:</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"130\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firelogger/helloworld.png\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<h3>Object Logging</h3>
<p><b>FireLogger</b> supports also object logging. Objects are sent as JSON over HTTP and you can inspect them just like you inspect JS objects in the webpage.</p>
<p>See an example:</p>
<div class=\"dean_ch\" style=\"white-space: wrap;\"><span class=\"kw2\"><?php</span><br />
<span class=\"kw1\">require</span> <span class=\"st0\">'firelogger.php'</span>;<br />
flog<span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Object %s\"</span>, <a href=\"http://www.php.net/array\"><span class=\"kw3\">array</span></a><span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Name\"</span> => <span class=\"st0\">\"Bob Marley\"</span>, <span class=\"st0\">\"Born\"</span> => <span class=\"st0\">\"1945\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>;<br />
<span class=\"kw2\">?></span></div>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"179\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firelogger/object-logging.png\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<p>Note the <strong>Log Inspector</strong> side panel - you can use it to inspect properties of an object coming from the server with the log.</p>

<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(*) Some components are currently moving away from mozStorage for performance and footprint reasons as they do not need the safety guarantees provided by mozStorage.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A long time ago, mozStorage and its users were completely synchronous and main-thread based. Needless to say, this eventually proved to be a design that <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/vdjeric/2013/01/24/add-on-performance-problems/\">doesn’t scale very well</a>. So, we set out on a quest to make mozStorage off main thread-friendly and to move all these uses off the main thread.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These days, whether you are developing add-ons or contributing to the Mozilla codebase, everything you need to access storage off the main thread are readily available to you. Let me introduce the two recommended flavors.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: This blog entry does not cover using database from *web applications* but from the *Mozilla Platform*. From web applications, you should use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB\">indexedDB</a>.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"more-1321\"></span></p>
<h3>In JavaScript, Sqlite.jsm (Firefox 20+)</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JavaScript users can access mozStorage directly but it is generally both much more convenient and much safer to use module <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Sqlite.jsm\">Sqlite.jsm</a>. This module has been introduce in Firefox 20 and upgraded in Firefox 25 with a number of performance/concurrency improvements, without change in client code.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firstly, we will import <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Sqlite.jsm\">Sqlite.jsm</a> and, to ensure that our code is easy to read, <a href=\"http://taskjs.org\">Task.jsm</a>:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">Components.utils.import(\"resource://gre/modules/Sqlite.jsm\");
Components.utils.import(\"resource://gre/modules/Task.jsm\");
</pre>
<p>We may now open (and later, close) the database:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">Task.spawn(function() {
let db;
try {
// Open a database
db = yield Sqlite.openConnection({ path: \"myDatabase.sqlite\" });
// ...
// Work with the database
// ...
//
} catch (ex) {
// Handle or report synchronous and asynchronous errors in any way you see fit
} finally {
// Don't forget to close the database or you will have bad surprises during shutdown
if (db) {
yield db.close();
}
}
});
</pre>
<p>Recall that we may use a synchronous syntax to perform asynchronous operations thanks to <tt>Task.spawn</tt>. Starting with Firefox 25, however, <tt>openConnection</tt> is executed off the main thread (by the time Firefox 25 graduates to beta, <tt>close</tt> should also be executed off the main thread, but this particular feature has not landed yet).</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the database is open, we may execute any SQL request, as follows:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">// Work with the database.
// mozStorage uses the same dialect of SQL as sqlite3.
// Create a table
yield db.execute(\"CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name INTEGER)\");
// Select content from another table
// Note parameter :domain. We give its value in a JavaScript object
yield db.execute(\"SELECT * FROM cookies_table WHERE domain = :domain\", {
domain: \"example.com\"
});
// If the statement is executed often, we will want to cache it
// for performance, as follows:
yield db.executeCached(\"SELECT * FROM cookies_table WHERE domain = :domain\", {
domain: \"example.com\"
});
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All <tt>execute</tt> and <tt>executeCached</tt> operations are executed off the main thread.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, Sqlite.jsm also supports transactions and schema management, but this is beyond the scope of this blog entry. For more details, see the full documentation of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Sqlite.jsm\">Sqlite.jsm</a>.</p>
<h3>In C++, mozIStorageAsyncConnection (Firefox 25+)</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firefox 25 introduces a new C++ API, <a href=\"http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/storage/public/mozIStorageAsyncConnection.idl?from=mozIStorageAsyncConnection.idl#l1). If you are familiar with <tt>mozIStorageConnection</tt> introduced back in Firefox 3, this API will not surprise you, as it implements a subset of <tt>mozIStorageConnection</tt>. It is, however, strongly recommended that you use <tt>mozIStorageAsyncConnection</tt> instead of <tt>mozIStorageConnection</tt>, as this new API ensures that all your mozStorage code is executed off the main thread and prevent a number of common errors (at the time of this writing, the implementation still closes databases on the main thread, but patches have been written to move this feature off the main thread and we expect that these patches will land in Firefox 25\"><tt>mozIStorageAsyncConnection</tt></a>.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Opening a <tt>mozIStorageAsyncConnection</tt> differs slightly from opening a <tt>mozIStorageConnection</tt>.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, let us import the mozStorage service:</p>
<p>nsCOMPtr<mozIStorageService> dbService =<br />
do_GetService(MOZ_STORAGE_SERVICE_CONTRACTID, &rv);<br />

<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We may now open the database asynchronously:</p>
<p>// Initialize file argument<br />

rv = NS_GetSpecialDirectory(NS_APP_USER_PROFILE_50_DIR,<br />
getter_AddRefs(dbFile));<br />
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {<br />

}<br />
rv = dbFile->Append(NS_LITERAL_STRING(\"myDatabase.sqlite\"));<br />
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {<br />

nsCOMPtr<mozIStorageConnection> dbConn;<br />
rv = dbService->AsyncOpenDatabase(dbFile, nullptr, getter_AddRefs(dbConn), onOpened);<br />
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {<br />
// FIXME: Handle error;<br />
}</p>

<p>    // …<br />
// Work with the database<br />

};</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As above, this database supports the dialect of SQL understood by sqlite3.</p>
<p>// Create the statement<br />

<p>// Now bind argument :domain<br />
rv = statement->BindUTF8StringByName(NS_LITERAL_CSTRING(\"domain\"),<br />

<p>// Execute the statement<br />
nsCOMPtr<mozIStorageCompletionCallback> onComplete = new OnComplete();<br />
rv = statement->ExecuteAsync(statement, onComplete);<br />
if (!NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {<br />
// FIXME: handle error<br />

<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before closing a database, you need to ensure that you hold no reference to its statements,<br />

are going to need to have a well-optimized binary data implementation.
Nikhil Marathe has prepared an <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578700&sourceid=Mozilla-search\">initial implementation</a>, but
it is limited to the interpreter. I am looking now at how to integrate
binary data into the JIT. The goal is to have accesses get compiled to
very efficient generated code. In this blog post, I specifically want
to cover the plan for integrating our type inference with binary data.</p>
<h3>Metatypes, descriptors, instances</h3>
<p>Let’s cover some terminology. In binary data, users create <em>type
descriptors</em> as follows:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">PointType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">LineType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">start</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">PointType</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">end</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">PointType</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>The built-ins for scalars (e.g., <code>float64</code>) are also type
descriptors. In contrast, the built-ins <code>StructType</code> and <code>ArrayType</code>
are called <em>metatypes</em> because they do not themselves represent types
but rather the means to define a type.</p>
<p>It is also possible to create types that include non-scalar data.  For
example, here is a struct that might be used for a binary tree:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">3</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">TreeType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">value</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">Any</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
</span><span class=\"line\">                               <span class=\"nx\">left</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
</span><span class=\"line\">                               <span class=\"nx\">right</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>Once you have a type descriptor, you can create instances of that
type descriptor using the <code>new</code> operator:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">3</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">origin</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">PointType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">unit</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">PointType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">line</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">LineType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">start</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">origin</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">end</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">unit</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>You can access the properties of these instances just as you would
expect:</p>

<p></p>
<p>The aim of this work is to optimize an expression like <code>line.end.y</code> so
that it can be compiled into a simple load of the relevant data.</p>
<h3>Canonical type representations</h3>
<p>Each time that a new type descriptor is created, we will create an
internal, canonical representation of the type it defines. So,
for example, if I created types like so:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">3</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">FloatPointType1</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">FloatPointType2</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">IntPointType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">uint32</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">uint32</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>There would be two canonical type representations created, one for
both <code>FloatPointType1</code> and <code>FloatPointType2</code> (which both describe the
same type) and one for <code>IntPointType</code>. These objects are never exposed
to the user. We could either reference count them or make them
collectable by the GC; in the latter case, it might be easiest to make
them be actual JS objects, albeit ones used in a very specialized way.</p>
<h3>Links from type objects to type representations</h3>
<p>Next we will augment the TI type objects for descriptors and instances
to contain a pointer to one of these canonical type representations.
This means that when the JIT compiler encounters an expression like
<code>point.x</code>, it can examine the type set for the object <code>point</code> to
find out both that <code>line</code> is a binary data instance and its
representation.</p>
<h4>Scalar property access</h4>
<p>The simple case is when are accessing a scalar property. For example,
imagine something like <code>point.x</code> where <code>point</code> is an instance of the
following type descriptor:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">PointType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>In this case, the JIT compiler can extract from the type object for
<code>point</code> that the property <code>x</code> is a <code>float64</code> and that it is at offset
0. It can then compile a direct access to load a float from that
memory location. Presumably this will require a few extra MIR, such as
<code>MLoadFloat(x, 0)</code> which extracts a float out of the binary data
instance <code>x</code> at offset 0.</p>
<h4>Any and object properties</h4>
<p>As mentioned earlier, type descriptors can also include
<code>any</code> and <code>object</code> properties, such as this binary tree example;</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">3</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">TreeType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">value</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">Any</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
</span><span class=\"line\">                               <span class=\"nx\">left</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
</span><span class=\"line\">                               <span class=\"nx\">right</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>We can handle these properties in one of two ways. The first option is
to always add barriers on every access to an object or any
property. This effectively doesn’t make any use of TI information.</p>
<p>The second option is to treat any/object properties the same way that
we treat properties on normal objects. We can record a type set for
each object property in the instance type object, and then add
barriers as we normally would. In some cases, this will allow us to
drop type barriers in the jitted code, but it shouldn’t make a large
difference in the performance otherwise. Still, if it’s easy to do, it
seems worth it to record type sets for object properties.</p>
<h4>Chained property access</h4>
<p>Remember though that our goal is to enable something like
<code>line.end.y</code>. This is a bit more complex, because the property <code>end</code>
is a property of complex (non-scalar) type. to us, <code>line.end.y</code> looks
like one compound property access, but in the JS interpreter, it is
actually <em>two</em> property accesses, one after the other.  In other
words, an expression like <code>var y = line.end.y</code> is equivalent to a bit
of code like this:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">tmp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">line</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">end</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">tmp</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>Here, the first access, <code>line.end</code>, returns a new, <em>derived instance</em>
for the point <code>end</code>. This derived instance aliases the original
line. So, at runtime, you could depict the objects and the runtime
memory as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    line
|
+--->  +--------+
| .start |
tmp      |  .x    |
|      |  .y    |
+--->  | .end   |
|  .x    |
|  .y    |
+--------+
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, we’d like the JIT to convert these two distinct property
accesses into one load, assuming it has adequate type information.
The next few paragraphs lay out my plan for making this happen. I
assume a certain amount of familiarity with IonMonkey, or at least
compilers and SSA representations.</p>
<p>When the JIT processes the first property access, <code>var tmp =
line.end</code>, it will observe from the type set of <code>line</code> that <code>end</code> is a
fetch of a complex property, causing it to generate a special MIR
opcode, distinct from a normal get property. Let’s denote this as
<code>MDerivedStruct(line, PointRepr, 16)</code>, meaning that it will create a
derived struct instance with the type representation <code>PointRepr</code> at
offset 8. Here by <code>PointRepr</code> I am referring to this internal
representation of the type descriptor that is contained in the type
object. The effect of this MIR is the same as the typical
<code>MGetProperty(line, \"end\")</code>, except that it provides more information
about what kind of kind of property will be fetched (such opcodes are
also known not to have side effects, unlike general property
accesses).</p>
<p>When the JIT then processes the next property access, <code>tmp.y</code>, it will
observe the MIR opcode that defines <code>tmp</code>. If this MIR opcode is
a <code>MDerivedStruct</code>, we can match the property <code>x</code> against <code>PointRepr</code>
and generate the appropriate direct load of the scalar value.</p>
<p>That means that the JIT will generate the following MIR:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">tmp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">line</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">end</span>    <span class=\"o\">>></span>      <span class=\"nx\">tmp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">MDerivedStruct</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">line</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">PointRepr</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">16</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">tmp</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">y</span>         <span class=\"o\">>></span>      <span class=\"nx\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">MLoadFloat</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">line</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">24</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>Note that the value <code>tmp</code> is not used anywhere; the definition of <code>x</code>
bypassed the temporary and loaded the scalar value directly from
<code>line</code>. The definition of <code>tmp</code> can then be removed by dead code
elimination.</p>
<p>In the case where the access to the complex property <em>is</em> the end
goal, such as an expression like <code>foo = line.end</code>, then the
<code>MDerivedStruct</code> will simply remain in the program. The generated code
can then call directly into the runtime functions for creating derived
structs (it could even just use the unoptimized, normal path in the
interpreter, but that’s suboptimal).</p>
<h5>The methods <code>get</code> and <code>set</code></h5>
<p>One implication of the design for accesses like <code>line.end.y</code> is that
if the type information is not precise, we will generate an
intermediate object, even if it seems unnecessary. For example, this
could occur if <code>line</code> is <em>sometimes</em> a normal JS object and
<em>sometimes</em> a binary data instance, or if it may be one of many kinds
of binary data instances that have distinct types.</p>
<p>Optimizing these cases is more difficult and doesn’t seem particularly
important; the former is particularly hard, as it may be that the
intermediate value is necessary. To optimize that would either require
generalizing our inline caching mechanism to handle multiple property
accesses (yuck) or generating a kind of “if-else” in the generated
code. Either way, more work than I think is necessary for what seems
to be a corner case.</p>
<p>However, there is also an alternate means to avoid
allocation. Programmers can instead use the <code>get</code> method that all
binary data instances offer.  So, <code>line.end.y</code> could be rewritten
<code>line.get(\"end\", \"y\")</code>. Naturally, the JIT will observe calls to <code>get</code>
and, if it can determine that <code>line</code> is a binary data object, and the
arguments are constants, it will optimize <code>line.get(\"end\", \"y\")</code> to
produce a simple load. But even if it’s information is lacking, the
runtime fallback for <code>get</code> can avoid allocating. Of course, this may
or may not be faster, depending on how optimized the alloction
pathways in the engine are.</p>
<h3>Type object canonicalization</h3>
<p>Normally, whenever there is some code like <code>new Foo</code>, we will produce
one type object per value of <code>Foo</code> (since <code>Foo</code> is typically a global
function definition, this means one type object). In the case of
binary data, it is plausible that the user defines multiple equivalent
type descriptors (e.g., <code>FloatPointType1</code> and <code>FloatPointType2</code> from
my earlier examples). In such cases, we could canonicalize the type
objects so that there is exactly one type object per unique type
representation. Similarly, we could canonicalize the type objects for
the instances, since having multiple type objects isn’t particularly
useful.</p>
<h3>Adding handles</h3>
<p>For simplicity, I didn’t discuss <em>handles</em>, which are effectively
binary data pointers. A handle lets you get a pointer to a subpiece of
another binary data object. This is <em>similar</em> to the derived objects I
mentioned earlier, except that (1) handles can be used to get a
pointer into a field or array element of any type, not just a complex
type like a struct; (2) handles can be reused and made to point at
other locations. Handles are mostly intended to be used in APIs that
wish to hand out a pointer to some subportion of a data structure.
For example, the <a href=\"http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/05/29/integrating-binary-data-and-pjs/\">plan for PJS</a> is to use handles when
constructing arrays of structs or compound types in parallel to allow
the callback to mutate the data in place rather than returning it
(which would necessitate a superfluous copy and allocation). Anyway,
integrating handles into this scheme is straightforward: like
instances and descriptors, type objects for handles would be
associated with the type representation of what they point at.</p>
<h3>Grungy implementation detail: saving bytes</h3>
<p>This section will probably not be of interest to you unless you are a
SpiderMonkey developer, and perhaps not even then.  It turns out that
we generate a lot of type objects and it is important not to add
fields to them willy nilly. Therefore, simply adding a new field to
all type objects that represents the link from a descriptor/instance
type object to the canonical type representation is overly wasteful,
since that field is inapplicable to the vast majority of type objects.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, I would make a subtype of <code>TypeObject</code>
(<code>BinaryDataTypeObject</code> or some such) to contain the extra
field. However, as type objects are GC things, doing that would
require adding a new finalizer kind, which would result in distinct
arenas for storing binary data type objects vs other type objects. Not
good.</p>
<p>So, what we can do is to reuse a technique that Shu uncovered.
Basically we can overload the <code>newScript</code> field. This field currently
stores a pointer to the constructor function for objects associated
with this type object; it is only relevant to code like <code>new Foo</code>
where <code>Foo</code> is a user-defined function.  This means that it is
inapplicable to the type objects for descriptors and instances.</p>

Nikhil Marathe has prepared an <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578700&sourceid=Mozilla-search\">initial implementation</a>, but
it is limited to the interpreter. I am looking now at how to integrate
binary data into the JIT. The goal is to have accesses get compiled to
very efficient generated code. In this blog post, I specifically want
to cover the plan for integrating our type inference with binary data.</p>
<h3>Metatypes, descriptors, instances</h3>
<p>Let’s cover some terminology. In binary data, users create <em>type
descriptors</em> as follows:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">PointType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">LineType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">start</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">Point</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">end</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">Point</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>The built-ins for scalars (e.g., <code>float64</code>) are also type
descriptors. In contrast, the built-ins <code>StructType</code> and <code>ArrayType</code>
are called <em>metatypes</em> because they do not themselves represent types
but rather the means to define a type.</p>
<p>It is also possible to create types that include non-scalar data.  For
example, here is a struct that might be used for a binary tree:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">3</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">TreeType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">value</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">Any</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
</span><span class=\"line\">                               <span class=\"nx\">left</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
</span><span class=\"line\">                               <span class=\"nx\">right</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>Once you have a type descriptor, you can create instances of that
type descriptor using the <code>new</code> operator:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">3</span>

</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">unit</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">PointType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">line</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">LineType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">start</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">origin</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">end</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">unit</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>You can access the properties of these instances just as you would
expect:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p></p>
<p>The aim of this work is to optimize an expression like <code>line.end.y</code> so
that it can be compiled into a simple load of the relevant data.</p>
<h3>Canonical type representations</h3>
<p>Each time that a new type descriptor is created, we will create an
internal, canonical representation of the type it defines. So,
for example, if I created types like so:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">3</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">FloatPointType1</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">FloatPointType2</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">IntPointType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">uint32</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">uint32</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>There would be two canonical type representations created, one for
both <code>FloatPointType1</code> and <code>FloatPointType2</code> (which both describe the
same type) and one for <code>IntPointType</code>. These objects are never exposed
to the user. We could either reference count them or make them
collectable by the GC; in the latter case, it might be easiest to make
them be actual JS objects, albeit ones used in a very specialized way.</p>
<h3>Links from type objects to type representations</h3>
<p>Next we will augment the TI type objects for descriptors and instances
to contain a pointer to one of these canonical type representations.
This means that when the JIT compiler encounters an expression like
<code>point.x</code>, it can examine the type set for the object <code>point</code> to
find out both that <code>line</code> is a binary data instance and its
representation.</p>
<h4>Scalar property access</h4>
<p>The simple case is when are accessing a scalar property. For example,
imagine something like <code>point.x</code> where <code>point</code> is an instance of the
following type descriptor:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">PointType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">float64</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>In this case, the JIT compiler can extract from the type object for
<code>point</code> that the property <code>x</code> is a <code>float64</code> and that it is at offset
0. It can then compile a direct access to load a float from that
memory location. Presumably this will require a few extra MIR, such as
<code>MLoadFloat(x, 0)</code> which extracts a float out of the binary data
instance <code>x</code> at offset 0.</p>
<h4>Any and object properties</h4>
<p>As mentioned earlier, type descriptors can also include
<code>any</code> and <code>object</code> properties, such as this binary tree example;</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">3</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">TreeType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">StructType</span><span class=\"p\">({</span><span class=\"nx\">value</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">Any</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
</span><span class=\"line\">                               <span class=\"nx\">left</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
</span><span class=\"line\">                               <span class=\"nx\">right</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>We can handle these properties in one of two ways. The first option is
to always add barriers on every access to an object or any
property. This effectively doesn’t make any use of TI information.</p>
<p>The second option is to treat any/object properties the same way that
we treat properties on normal objects. We can record a type set for
each object property in the instance type object, and then add
barriers as we normally would. In some cases, this will allow us to
drop type barriers in the jitted code, but it shouldn’t make a large
difference in the performance otherwise. Still, if it’s easy to do, it
seems worth it to record type sets for object properties.</p>
<h4>Chained property access</h4>
<p>Remember though that our goal is to enable something like
<code>line.end.y</code>. This is a bit more complex, because the property <code>end</code>
is a property of complex (non-scalar) type. Absent any type
information, the expression <code>line.end.y</code> is actually presented to the
JIT as two accesses with a temporary object in between:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">tmp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">line</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">end</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">tmp</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>The first access, <code>line.end</code>, returns a new, <em>derived instance</em> for
the point <code>end</code>. This derived instance aliases the original line. So,
at runtime, you could depict the objects and the runtime memory as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>    line
|
+--->  +--------+
| .start |
tmp      |  .x    |
|      |  .y    |
+--->  | .end   |
|  .x    |
|  .y    |
+--------+
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, in the JIT, we’d prefer to avoid constructing this
intermediate object where possible.</p>
<p>My current plan is that when the JIT processes the first
property access:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">tmp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">line</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>It will (hopefully) observe from the type set of <code>line</code> that <code>end</code> is
a fetch of a complex property, causing it to generate a special MIR
opcode, distinct from a normal get property. Let’s denote this as
<code>MDerivedStruct(line, PointRepr, 16)</code>, meaning that it will create a
derived struct instance with the type representation <code>PointRepr</code> at
offset 8. Here by <code>PointRepr</code> I am referring to this internal
representation of the type descriptor that is contained in the type
object. The effect of this MIR is the same as the typical
<code>MGetProperty(line, \"end\")</code>, except that it provides more information
about what kind of kind of property will be fetched (such opcodes are
also known not to have side effects, unlike general property
accesses).</p>
<p>When the JIT then processes the next property access, <code>tmp.y</code>, it will
observe the MIR opcode that defines <code>tmp</code>. If this MIR opcode is
a <code>MDerivedStruct</code>, we can match the property <code>x</code> against <code>PointRepr</code>
and generate the appropriate direct load of the scalar value.</p>
<p>That means that the JIT will generate the following MIR:</p>
<figure class=\"code\"><span></span><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span>
<span class=\"line-number\">2</span>
</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><code class=\"javascript\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">tmp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">line</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">end</span>    <span class=\"o\">>></span>      <span class=\"nx\">tmp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">MDerivedStruct</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">line</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">PointRepr</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">16</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>
</span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">tmp</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">y</span>         <span class=\"o\">>></span>      <span class=\"nx\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">MLoadFloat</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">line</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">24</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
<p>Note that the value <code>tmp</code> is not used anywhere; the definition of <code>x</code>
bypassed the temporary and loaded the scalar value directly from
<code>line</code>. The definition of <code>tmp</code> can then be removed by dead code
elimination.</p>
<p>In the case where the access to the complex property <em>is</em> the end
goal, such as an expression like <code>foo = line.end</code>, then the
<code>MDerivedStruct</code> will simply remain in the program. The generated code
can then call directly into the runtime functions for creating derived
structs (it could even just use the unoptimized, normal path in the
interpreter, but that’s suboptimal).</p>
<h5>The methods <code>get</code> and <code>set</code></h5>
<p>One implication of the design for accesses like <code>line.end.y</code> is that
if the type information is not precise, we will generate an
intermediate object, even if it seems unnecessary. For example, this
could occur if <code>line</code> is <em>sometimes</em> a normal JS object and
<em>sometimes</em> a binary data instance, or if it may be one of many kinds
of binary data instances that have distinct types.</p>
<p>Optimizing these cases is more difficult and doesn’t seem particularly
important; the former is particularly hard, as it may be that the
intermediate value is necessary. To optimize that would either require
generalizing our inline caching mechanism to handle multiple property
accesses (yuck) or generating a kind of “if-else” in the generated
code. Either way, more work than I think is necessary for what seems
to be a corner case.</p>
<p>However, there is also an alternate means to avoid
allocation. Programmers can instead use the <code>get</code> method that all
binary data instances offer.  So, <code>line.end.y</code> could be rewritten
<code>line.get(\"end\", \"y\")</code>. Naturally, the JIT will observe calls to <code>get</code>
and, if it can determine that <code>line</code> is a binary data object, and the
arguments are constants, it will optimize <code>line.get(\"end\", \"y\")</code> to
produce a simple load. But even if it’s information is lacking, the
runtime fallback for <code>get</code> can avoid allocating. Of course, this may
or may not be faster, depending on how optimized the alloction
pathways in the engine are.</p>
<h3>Type object canonicalization</h3>
<p>Normally, whenever there is some code like <code>new Foo</code>, we will produce
one type object per value of <code>Foo</code> (since <code>Foo</code> is typically a global
function definition, this means one type object). In the case of
binary data, it is plausible that the user defines multiple equivalent
type descriptors (e.g., <code>FloatPointType1</code> and <code>FloatPointType2</code> from
my earlier examples). In such cases, we could canonicalize the type
objects so that there is exactly one type object per unique type
representation. Similarly, we could canonicalize the type objects for
the instances, since having multiple type objects isn’t particularly
useful.</p>
<h3>Adding handles</h3>
<p>For simplicity, I didn’t discuss <em>handles</em>, which are effectively
binary data pointers. A handle lets you get a pointer to a subpiece of
another binary data object. This is <em>similar</em> to the derived objects I
mentioned earlier, except that (1) handles can be used to get a
pointer into a field or array element of any type, not just a complex
type like a struct; (2) handles can be reused and made to point at
other locations. Handles are mostly intended to be used in APIs that
wish to hand out a pointer to some subportion of a data structure.
For example, the <a href=\"http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/05/29/integrating-binary-data-and-pjs/\">plan for PJS</a> is to use handles when
constructing arrays of structs or compound types in parallel to allow
the callback to mutate the data in place rather than returning it
(which would necessitate a superfluous copy and allocation). Anyway,
integrating handles into this scheme is straightforward: like
instances and descriptors, type objects for handles would be
associated with the type representation of what they point at.</p>
<h3>Grungy implementation detail: saving bytes</h3>
<p>This section will probably not be of interest to you unless you are a
SpiderMonkey developer, and perhaps not even then.  It turns out that
we generate a lot of type objects and it is important not to add
fields to them willy nilly. Therefore, simply adding a new field to
all type objects that represents the link from a descriptor/instance
type object to the canonical type representation is overly wasteful,
since that field is inapplicable to the vast majority of type objects.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, I would make a subtype of <code>TypeObject</code>
(<code>BinaryDataTypeObject</code> or some such) to contain the extra
field. However, as type objects are GC things, doing that would
require adding a new finalizer kind, which would result in distinct
arenas for storing binary data type objects vs other type objects. Not
good.</p>
<p>So, what we can do is to reuse a technique that Shu uncovered.
Basically we can overload the <code>newScript</code> field. This field currently
stores a pointer to the constructor function for objects associated
with this type object; it is only relevant to code like <code>new Foo</code>
where <code>Foo</code> is a user-defined function.  This means that it is
inapplicable to the type objects for descriptors and instances.</p>" nil nil "eaebcef0ed4070c3f7143525f300aeeb") (390 (20969 825 361026) "http://www.marcozehe.de/2013/07/19/small-demo-video-about-firefox-os-accessibility/" "Marco Zehe: Small demo video about Firefox OS accessibility" "Marco" "Fri, 19 Jul 2013 08:53:07 +0000" "<p>Over the past few weeks, especially after the <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/07/firefox-os-devices-officially-released/\">launch of Firefox OS devices</a> in early July, I received a lot of questions about the accessibility of this mobile operating system purely based on web technologies.</p>

"digdug2k" "Thu, 18 Jul 2013 22:04:59 +0000" "<p>Just this week one of our intern heros, Shilpan Bagat landed a fancy new addon API for people in Fennec that we’re calling “page actions”. Essentially, they’re clickable indicators in the urlbar, a lot like what Desktop Firefox already has.</p>
<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile/API/NativeWindow#pageactions\">API</a> is pretty simple, so I thought it would be funner to show an example add-on using it here instead. So this is a short tutorial on adding a <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/refresher/\">refresh button to the urlbar</a> in Fennec. To start, we just have to fork the awesome <a href=\"https://github.com/mfinkle/skeleton-addon-fxandroid/blob/master/bootstrap.js\">skeleton add-on</a> put together by mfinkle a bit ago (we’re going to update the skeleton with an example of pageactions soon too).</p>
<p><a href=\"http://digdug2k.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/screenshot_2013-07-18-13-57-47.png\"><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" id=\"i-301\" src=\"http://digdug2k.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/screenshot_2013-07-18-13-57-47.png?w=487\" /><span id=\"more-348\"></span></a>The skeleton has a pretty simple config file that we need to fixup with our add-on’s info, config_build.sh:</p>
<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">APP_NAME=<strong>“Refresher”</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">CHROME_PROVIDERS=</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">CLEAN_UP=1</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">ROOT_FILES=”bootstrap.js <strong>icon.png</strong>“</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">ROOT_DIRS=<strong>“chrome”</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">BEFORE_BUILD=</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">AFTER_BUILD=</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">PUSH_TO_DEVICE=1</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">ANDROID_APP_ID=org.mozilla.<strong>fennec</strong></span></p>
<p>I bolded the bits I had to change. Namely, I added a name and an icon in the root directory (I added icon.png by stealing the current Fennec reload icon). I also needed an icon to show in th e urlbar, so I created a chrome directory. Finally, this API is only available in nightly builds, so I had to change the build script to install in Nightly instead of release Firefox. You don’t actually have to use that, or the adb install scripts. You can just host your add-on on a site (or even a dropbox account), and install from there. But its a nice quick turnaround if you do have adb installed.</p>
<p>I also updated <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Install_Manifests\"><strong>install.rdf</strong></a> with my addon info, and added a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Chrome_Registration\"><strong>chrome.manifest</strong></a> file:</p>
<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">content       refresher                   chrome/</span></p>
<p>(there’s some sort of bug in the chrome resolveGeckoURI that doesn’t like chrome skins, I’m filing a bug to look into that). The meat of the addon is pretty simple. I removed everything in the skeleton addon between the isNativeFennec function and the windowListener.</p>
<p>We already have a refresh button on tablets, so I threw together a quick function to verify we’re not on a tablet:</p>
<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">function isPhone(window) {</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">  return !window.BrowserApp.isTablet;</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">}</span></p>
<p>We also want to store our pageaction id, somewhere. Since we’re pretty isolated here in bootstrap.js, I just added a global to hold this. If you are doing something complex, its probably best practice to encapsulate this somehow:</p>
<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">var refreshItem = null;</span></p>
<p>In the loadIntoWindow function then, I want to register our page action. I’ve lucked out and picked something easy here. We can just add the page action here and never have to worry about updating it (until uninstall). For a more complex page action, you might listen to page loads, and update the action based on the url (for instance, we’re planning to add a page action for “Open in an app!”).</p>
<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">function loadIntoWindow(window) {</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">  if (!window)</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">    return;</span></p>
<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">  if (isNativeUI() && isPhone(window)) {</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">    refreshItem = window.NativeWindow.pageactions.add({</span></p>
<p>      // This title is only shown if more than 2 page actions are shown and we overflow into a dropdown menu. This should be localized.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to do the actual reload.

<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">  webNav.reload(flags);</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">}</span></p>
<p>Finally, when the addon is uninstalled, we need to remove our icon using the pageactions.remove api<br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">function unloadFromWindow(window) {</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">  if (!window)</span><br /><span style=\"color: #888888;\">    return;</span></p>

<p>Pretty simple! Once you’ve gotten your head wrapped around mobile development, its pretty easy to do nice stuff. We’ve added a few more API’s recently that I’m going to try and blog about soon (with companion neat-o addons where I can), but we’re really interested in what you can do with them, what you think you need, and how we can make the whole process easier.</p>

<p>It is the retail model. Easy-peezy, everyone likes it.</p>
<p>Everyone, that is, except the consumer. They don’t seem to particularly like the retail model. To them, apps are increasingly a media product that is supported by a media business model; free stuff paid for by ads.</p>
<p>You should read the original post (link below) but here’s the money quote:</p>
<h4><em>The People Have Spoken; It’s Time To Change The Conversation.</em></h4>
<p><em>While consumers may not like in-app advertising, their behavior makes it clear that they are willing to accept it in exchange for free content, just as we have in radio, TV and online for decades. In light of that, it seems that the conversation about whether apps should have ads is largely over. Developers of some specialized apps may be able to monetize through paid downloads, and game apps sometimes generate significant revenue through in-app purchases, but since consumers are unwilling to pay for most apps, and most app developers need to make money somehow, it seems clear that ads in apps are a sure thing for the foreseeable future. Given that, we believe it’s time to shift the conversation away from whether there should be ads in apps at all, and instead determine how to make ads in apps as interesting and relevant as possible for consumers, and as efficient and effective as possible for advertisers and developers.</em></p>

<p><a href=\"http://firelogger.binaryage.com/\">FireLogger</a> implements simple yet powerful server side logging (similar to <code>console.log</code> on the client side). It creates a new panel (a logging console) in Firebug UI that displays logs coming from the server.</p>
<p>Logs are sent to the client side over HTTP headers. The extension supports <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> scripts. </p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firelogger/firelogger.png\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<p>You can dowload it from <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/firelogger/\">AMO</a>.</p>
<p><span id=\"more-759\"></span></p>
<h3>Hello From PHP</h3>
<p>Let's take a quick look at how to create a simple log in PHP script that is visible in your Firebug.</p>
<p>Download <a href=\"http://github.com/binaryage/firelogger.php\">firelogger.php</a> and:</p>
<div class=\"dean_ch\" style=\"white-space: wrap;\"><span class=\"kw2\"><?php</span><br />
<span class=\"kw1\">require</span> <span class=\"st0\">'firelogger.php'</span>;<br />
flog<span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Hello world!\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>;<br />
<span class=\"kw2\">?></span></div>
<p>This is how the log looks like in your browser:</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"130\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firelogger/helloworld.png\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<h3>Object Logging</h3>
<p><b>FireLogger</b> supports also object logging. Objects are sent as JSON over HTTP and you can inspect them just like you inspect JS objects in the webpage.</p>
<p>See an example:</p>
<div class=\"dean_ch\" style=\"white-space: wrap;\"><span class=\"kw2\"><?php</span><br />
<span class=\"kw1\">require</span> <span class=\"st0\">'firelogger.php'</span>;<br />
flog<span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Object %s\"</span>, <a href=\"http://www.php.net/array\"><span class=\"kw3\">array</span></a><span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">\"Name\"</span> => <span class=\"st0\">\"Bob Marley\"</span>, <span class=\"st0\">\"Born\"</span> => <span class=\"st0\">\"1945\"</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span><span class=\"br0\">)</span>;<br />
<span class=\"kw2\">?></span></div>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"179\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/firelogger/object-logging.png\" width=\"520\" /></p>
<p>Note the <strong>Log Inspector</strong> side panel - you can use it to inspect properties of an object coming from the server with the log.</p>

AccelerateAB billed itself as the largest gathering of tech entrepreneurs in Alberta history and with +300 people in attendance, that was probably true.
I was lucky enough to sit down with some great companies as well as participate on a panel about strategies and techniques on selling.
The highlight for many was hearing Mozilla's CEO Gary Kovacs talk about how the next 2 billion consumers will be accessing the web via their mobile devices, and how smartphones like FirefoxOS have the potential to radically accelerate the way economies grow and people escape poverty in emerging markets.

<br />
What many people of those writing works on preserved software or museums doing exhibits on it do want from collectors in those cases is artifacts, or if you want \"meta-materials\", around the software itself - packaging, guides, brochures, ads, posters, magazine reviews, and whatnot. With those pieces, any papers or exhibits on the software becomes way more interesting and can also deliver some of the culture around the software.<br />
<br />
And that made me wonder somewhat - I know we are preserving all binaries we ever shipped and all code at Mozilla, even our website code, but how much of physical objects related to our software are we preserving? Well, we don't have packaging, but we had CDs for some stuff (I remember one for Mozilla 1.0), we did T-shirts, stickers, etc. - and there's surely magazine articles, the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wangbailin/32498363/\">NY Times ad</a>, and similar items. What of all that do we still have preserved? Do we have some kind of archive at Mozilla for that?<br />
<br />
Here's a part of my \"personal collection\" of Mozilla artifacts:<br />
<a href=\"http://home.kairo.at/?d=g&i=317&m=f&f.i=23152\"><img alt=\"Image No. 23152\" src=\"http://home.kairo.at/?d=g&p=23152&f.m=normal\" style=\"height: 267px; width: 400px;\" /></a><br />
I hope we have a better collection of those things somewhere at Mozilla headquarters or so. <img alt=\";-)\" class=\"icon\" src=\"http://home.kairo.at/?d=b&p=s_wink\" style=\"height: 19px; width: 19px;\" title=\"wink\" /><br />
<br />
A larger problem for preservation is if you want to preserve the environment and culture that the software was running in, e.g. how it was when you connected the C64 to the TV in your family's home, or even when you ran Altavista (which just has <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altavista#Shutdown\">been shut down</a>) for Internet search. At this level, preserving, reproducing or even emulating the environment and experience of older software is becoming really hard - but an interesting challenge esp. for museums trying to educate new generations about our history.<br />
<br />
Another, connected, topic is metadata of the software itself - from product names/versions and writers/vendors via info on installation media/packages to file names, checksums and settings of the installed software there is a lot of metadata one can collect along with the preserved binaries and/or code.<br />
<br />
For example, NIST's <a href=\"http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/\">National Software Reference Library</a> (NSRL) - see also <a href=\"http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2012/05/life-saving-the-national-software-reference-library/\">this interview by the LoC</a> - is collecting a lot of information about the installed software, and also what it leaves behind when uninstalled (as their original cause is to help the FBI find out what was installed on investigated computers).<br />
And this metadata collection might actually provide us with an opportunity: Knowing the names and checksums of libraries installed with valid software can help us identify at least some of the libraries we see correlated with crashes. For that reason, we recently did get the <a href=\"https://dragnet.mozilla.org/\">Dragnet</a> tool online that is intended to help us there, and it would be great if metadata from NSRL or similar efforts can be connected to that and help us in our own investigations there.<br />

<h3>Updating my role at Mozilla</h3>
<p><strong>I’m passionate about working open. </strong>And in particular the role that <em>stories</em> and effective <em>communication </em>play in scaling up community. Going forward, I’m going to focus on adding <em>data</em> to that mix, and in particular using data to optimize our <em>systems</em> and on-ramps for community participation.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://openmatt.org/done\">Here’s some</a> of what I’ve accomplished lately. This post is about what I’m going to tackle next, over the coming 12 – 18 months.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"332\" src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2832/8939658310_397e7c33d6.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></p>
<h3>Optimizing our engagement ladder for educators and mentors</h3>
<p><strong>I’ll start by focusing on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">mentors</span>. </strong>These are teachers, educators and Mozillians who want to teach the web, and help other people learn digital skills. As such, I’ll be a bit of a hybrid: working with the MoFo communications, mentor and webmaker.org engineering teams.</p>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p><strong>More systematic on-ramps for participation</strong>. We have a core offering. Next we want to build the communications and community infrastructure to scale it up, especially for mentors.</p>
<p>Why focus on mentors and our educational offering first?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Because the opportunity is big. </strong>We can scale and grow this community.</li>
<li><strong>Because we need clearer ways to a) count them and b) communicate with them</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Because it solves a larger strategic goal for Mozilla</strong>. An inspiring, lower-bar for people to participate in Mozilla’s mission.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Four key ingredients</h3>
<p><strong>Building a better bacon stack. </strong>I’ll use this engagement lens, as per <a href=\"http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/\">Jono Bacon</a>‘s thesis that community participation thrives on four key ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>on ramps</strong>. the main paths into the project, including the <em>systems</em> and infrastructure behind them.</li>
<li><strong>calls to action</strong>. bite-sized invitations to get involved, written in a language people understand and care about.</li>
<li><strong>documentation</strong>. how to do it. clear steps that normal humans can understand and follow.</li>
<li><strong>celebration</strong>. celebrating our best contributors. making community the stars. giving them more power.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>We’re already doing versions of all of these things</strong>. Smart colleagues are already doing all of this. The opportunity is to optimize, and be more systematic about it — in terms of how we a) use data to support decisions, and b) co-ordinate across teams.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://openmatt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Teach-the-Web.png\"><img alt=\"Teach the Web\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7969\" height=\"413\" src=\"http://openmatt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Teach-the-Web.png\" width=\"494\" /></a></p>
<h3>Being systematic: data as the fifth key ingredient</h3>
<p><strong>Data</strong>. We’ve done most of the above on good hunches so far, plus a smattering of data. Going forward, we need to be more systematic about this — which means using data to prioritize and guide us more. And in particular: using data to test some key hypotheses.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Being <em>systematic</em> is about making choices based on data, instead of just hunches.”<br />

<h3><strong>How do we measure success?</strong></h3>
<p>Chris Lawrence, Michelle , Laura, Leah and the rest of the mentor team are already working on this. A dashboard could include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1) sign-ups</strong>.<strong> </strong>Mentor email sign-ups. + social media followers. How many mentors can we communicate with?</li>
<li><strong>2) mentor badges</strong>. Number of Webmaker Mentor badges issued. How many of them actually earn a Mentor badge? This could be our key conversion metric. <em></em></li>
<li><strong>3) events</strong>. Number of Webmaker <em>events</em>. And approximate number of people reached, as part of Maker Party and beyond.</li>
<li><strong>4) networks</strong>. Growing the number of Hive / Webmaker <em>networks </em>in cities around the world.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Plus web site data:
<ul>
<li><strong>Traffic</strong>. To webmaker.org/teach. Number of unique visitors to our mentor offering, plus related pages.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion rate</strong>. Amount of that traffic that actually does something meaningful. (How do we want to measure that?)</li>
<li><strong>Contribution</strong>. Number and quality of educational resources contributed by community.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>What’s my work plan?</h3>
<p><strong>July to Sep 15<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/Mentor/Roadmap/Website\"><strong>Ship a roadmap for webmaker.org/teach</strong></a>. [COMPLETE!] Helping to define and shape the on-ramps for mentor participation on webmaker.org/teach. From now to MozFest. Simplify. Focus on early quick wins to a) raise content quality and b) showcase the best current community contribution.</li>
<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=[maker%20party]&list_id=7241617\"><strong>Helping to tackle key Maker Party pain points and opportunities</strong></a>. Mostly around documentation. Then optimizing fresh calls to action and celebration for mentors.</li>
<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=885372\"><strong>Optimize Bugzilla for Comms</strong></a>. We started this work — just need to finish it. This strengthens our internal work systems. Plus our ability to co-ordinate across teams.</li>
<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=862842\"><strong>Optimize mentor sign-up</strong></a>. Understand roadmap for Webmaker.org single sign-on and ability to self-identify as a mentor. Ensure prominent mentor BSD sign-up on /teach and other places.<strong> </strong></li>
<li><strong>Start digging into the data</strong>. Working with the Mentor Team to figure out a) what data we’re already collecting, and b) what new data we want to start collecting. Start building a dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Reach out to colleagues at MoCo</strong>. Doing similar work. Learn from them.</li>
<li><strong>Document our engagement ladder</strong>. Do an “on ramp audit.” Attach data to it.</li>
<li><strong>Document</strong>. Document what we did. Present on it. Evaluate. See if there’s stuff that could be useful to others in the org.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sep 15 – Dec 31<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recruit volunteer comms community members</strong>. To help tell stories, write posts, and contribute to our overall comms work. We want to be able to assign tickets to community volunteers. I already have a couple volunteers for this at Moz Fest.</li>
<li><strong>Use MozFest as a massive teaching kit content sprint. </strong>Have the systems, documentation and people in place to capture the best stuff at MozFest as Teaching Kits. Use MozFest to generate a ton of great new mentor teaching resources.<strong><br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use MozFest as a mentor badge recruitment drive</strong>. “Have you earned your Webmaker Mentor badge?” Have a presence and make that a key call to action. To spread digital skills. And share what you’re learning at MozFest with others around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Design and document a Mentor badge celebration system</strong>. Every time a mentor earns his or her wings, there should a little moment of celebration (which in turn drives more sign-ups.) Like “Friends of the Tree.”</li>
<li><strong>Optimize mentor email newsletter</strong>. How do we communicate with mentor email sign-ups more regularly and effectively?</li>
<li><strong>Ship a mentor metrics dashboard</strong>. One-stop dashboard. Probably refine down to three key metrics of success.</li>
<li><strong>Ship a new Mozilla-wide on-ramp</strong>. Like mozilla.org/teach or mozilla.org/education. Telling a crisp story about Mozilla going big in digital literacy and education. With easy sign-up and linking through to our core offerings.</li>
<li><strong>Document and evaluate</strong>. Rinse and repeat.</li>

Benjamin has <a href=\"http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2013-04-09/introducing-jydoop-fast-and-sane-map-reduce/\">a post explaining what it is and how it works</a>, but I wanted to describe one specific use: measuring main-thread responsiveness issues in the wild.</p>
<p><strong>First, a bit of backstory!</strong></p>
<p>One of my team’s overarching goals for a long time has been eliminating all sources of main-thread file I/O.[<a href=\"http://www.gavinsharp.com/blog/tag/mozilla/feed/#f1\" name=\"fr1\">1</a>] One of the worst main-thread I/O offenders in Firefox code is our <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Storage\">SQLite Storage API</a>. A few years ago we went a bit overboard using a version of this API that is synchronous, and does its file I/O work on the main thread. So recently we’ve been focused a lot on <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=699820\">eliminating all users of that API</a>.</p>
<p>One consumer of this API that we <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566746\">fixed in Firefox 23</a> is the <a href=\"http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/satchel/\">Form History code</a> (responsible for remembering information entered into web forms and offering to re-fill it). <a href=\"http://enndeakin.wordpress.com/\">Neil Deakin</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skippyhammond\">markh</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mak77\">mak</a> worked together to fix the core service (based on earlier work from a previous Mozilla intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ffx\">Felix</a>), but after landing that improvement, taras noticed that there were <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=876002\">still some remaining issues</a>. We eventually determined that the likely primary culprit for the remaining Form History main-thread I/O was Firefox Sync’s use of the older Form History API. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skippyhammond\">markh</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rnewman\">rnewman</a> worked together to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=878677\">fix Sync</a>, but we weren’t entirely sure whether that was sufficient to eliminate all of the main thread I/O we were seeing reported by telemetry.<br />
<strong><br />
Now, to the jydoop part</strong></p>
<p>Taras had identified that our initial Form History fix wasn’t complete using the <a href=\"https://metrics.mozilla.com/\">SlowSQL telemetry dashboard</a>. This gives a high-level overview of slow SQL statements occurring in the wild, and he noticed that after we landed the original fix for form history, some formhistory.sqlite statements were still showing up. Unfortunately, the SlowSQL dashboard only offers two time ranges: previous week, and the previous month, and it aggregates data across all builds from a specific channel (e.g. “nightly”), which means that I couldn’t easily use it to confirm whether our Sync fix was effective.</p>
<p>That’s where jydoop came into the picture. It allows much more sophisticated analysis of the SlowSQL data. I wrote a couple of jydoop scripts: <a href=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~gavin/jydoop/formhistory-sync-before.py.txt\">one</a> to summarize the slowSQL reports for formhistory.sqlite from builds before the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=878677\">Sync fix</a> (i.e. Nightly builds with a build ID < 20130623) and <a href=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~gavin/jydoop/formhistory-sync-after.py.txt\">another</a> to do the same for builds containing the fix. I then ran those scripts against Telemetry reports from the period from 2013-06-21 to 2013-06-24 (inclusive, i.e. roughly two days on either side of the landing of the fix).</p>
<p><strong>The results!</strong></p>
<p>The <a href=\"https://people.mozilla.com/~gavin/jydoop/formhistory-sync-results.txt\">results</a> are pretty conclusive: the reports of slow SQL statements for formhistory.sqlite from builds including the Sync fix were dramatically reduced. The most frequently slow statement from builds before the fix (“COMMIT TRANSACTION”) was responsible for a total of 417 seconds of main-thread unresponsiveness (174993 occurences of slowness at an average of 143ms of “jank” at a time), over that period. The Sync fix prevented that statement (and many other slow statements) from occurring at all, thus removing a significant cause of main-thread responsiveness issues experienced by Firefox users in the wild.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p>If you look at the results in more detail, they reveal that there are still some slow SQL main-thread operations happening on formhistory.sqlite – they’re less frequent and severe, and are tracked by <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=888784\">other bugs</a>. I’m going to be using jydoop to gather more data on the improvements my team’s already made, as well as gauge the potential for improvement in areas we’re still working on. I also want others on the team to learn to use jydoop, so that people can make their own measurements to validate the improvements they’re working on.</p>
<p><small>[<a href=\"http://www.gavinsharp.com/blog/tag/mozilla/feed/#fr1\" name=\"f1\">1</a>] Main-thread file I/O is a term used to describe trying to read from or write to the disk on the same thread (the “main thread”) as you’re trying to respond to user input (e.g. mouse/key events) and do other things like drawing the UI. Reading from or writing to the disk can take a relatively long time, particularly if you have a slow hard drive, so we want to always do it on a background thread so that those other important responsiveness tasks (responding to input and updating the UI) aren’t affected.</small></p>" nil nil "257f3562f96273152db69392abdb6ee3") (372 (20967 42288 782304) "http://monica-at-mozilla.blogspot.com/2013/07/be-who-you-want-when-you-want.html" "Monica Chew: Be who you want, when you want" "Monica Chew" "Wed, 17 Jul 2013 17:41:27 +0000" "Back in May I presented a <a href=\"http://w2spconf.com/2013/papers/s1p2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">paper on contextual identity</a>, coauthored with <a href=\"http://blog.sidstamm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sid Stamm</a>, at the <a href=\"http://w2spconf.com/2013/\" target=\"_blank\">Web 2.0 Security and Privacy</a> workshop.

<p>For the web to move away from JavaScript, there are currently two active proposals: <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/native-client/\">Google Native Client</a> (NaCl) and <a href=\"http://asmjs.org/\">asm.js</a>. NaCl comes with some trade-offs, like interpretability; asm.js on ARM is still in active development, and we will not know whether or not it would bring the same performance boost on x86.</p>
<p>Obviously, without JavaScript, the web as we (the front-end web developers) know it will cease to exist. It’s not necessary a bad thing though  — while the web moving a way from a place I grew up, where everyone can find out the layout or logic of any website with view source, it had also involved to something much useful and powerful, embedded into everyone’s digital life more deeply. Yet, working on Mozilla payroll means there is no excuse to give up on the Open Web — even though I am not the person who make these decisions, thought experiments is always a fun thing to do.</p>
<p>So, maybe 10 years from now, website, or web apps would do this: Probe the CPU architecture of your hardware, drop the corresponding optimized asm.js or NaCl bytecode to your device, and render the entire screen with WebGL. There might even be Flash-like authoring tool for that, or even WebHAL — a library to abstract CPU/GPU differences. Think about what the Open Web gain or loose at that future.</p>
<p>As for JavaScript, in that future, people would have conversation <a href=\"http://ro-che.info/ccc/20.html\">like this comic</a> (<strong>spooler alert below</strong>; thanks <a href=\"http://kanru.info/blog/\">Kanru</a> for the link):</p>

Nor I will try to be an <em>web fanboy</em> to pin the arthur as an Apple fanboy to repudiate what he just wrote. <strong>The question I would like to bring up is: Supposedly all of the analysis (and the conclusion) are true, what would the future holds for Open Web in post-PC world?</strong></p>
<p>For the web to move away from JavaScript, there are currently two active proposals: <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/native-client/\">Google Native Client</a> (NaCl) and <a href=\"http://asmjs.org/\">asm.js</a>. NaCl comes with some trade-offs, like interpretability; asm.js on ARM is still in active development, and we will not know whether or not it would bring the same performance boost on x86.</p>
<p>Obviously, without JavaScript, the web as we (the front-end web developers) know it will cease to exist. It’s not necessary a bad thing though  — while the web moving a way from a place I grew up, where everyone can find out the layout or logic of any website with view source, it had also involved to something much useful and powerful, embedded into everyone’s digital life more deeply. Yet, working on Mozilla payroll means there is no excuse to give up on the Open Web — even though I am not the person who make these decisions, thought experiments is always a fun thing to do.</p>
<p>So, maybe 10 years from now, website, or web apps would do this: Probe the CPU architecture of your hardware, drop the corresponding optimized asm.js or NaCl bytecode to your device, and render the entire screen with WebGL. There might even be Flash-like authoring tool for that, or even WebHAL — a library to abstract CPU/GPU differences. Think about what the Open Web gain or loose at that future.</p>
<p>As for JavaScript, in that future, people would have conversation <a href=\"http://ro-che.info/ccc/20.html\">like this comic</a> (<strong>spooler alert below</strong>; thanks <a href=\"http://kanru.info/blog/\">Kanru</a> for the link):</p>

<p>In this post, we'll take a quick look at one of them: <em>Console Export</em>.</p>
<p><strong>ConsoleExport</strong> is a Firebug extension (you need Firebug 1.6+) that allows exporting logs from the Console panel. The export can be done manually through an <em>Export</em> button (see the screenshot below) or automatically by sending every log to the server.</p>
<p><span id=\"more-753\"></span></p>
<h3>ConsoleExport</h3>
<p>Here is the UI that appears in Firebug after ConsoleExport is installed in your Firefox.</p>
<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/consoleexport/images/post-console-export.png\" title=\"Export button in the Console panel\" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few links:</p>
<ul>
<li>ConsoleExport <a href=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/consoleexport/\">home page</a></li>
<li>You can download ConsoleExport from <a href=\"http://getfirebug.com/releases/consoleexport/\">here</a></li>
<li>You can report an issue or suggest new feature <a href=\"https://github.com/firebug/consoleexport/issues\">here</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Auto Export Every Console Log</h3>
<p>Since most of the details about manual export is already available on the <a href=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/consoleexport/\">home page</a> let's focus on auto-export where all logs are sent to the server as XML packets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step1: Activate auto-export</strong><br />
There are two ways how to activate/deactivate auto-export. You can use Firebug UI and click the little circle next to the <em>Export</em> button.</p>
<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.softwareishard.com/firebug/extensions/consoleexport/images/post-activate-auto-export.png\" title=\"Activate auto export\" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In case of automated scenarios (e.g. when Selenium is integrated) you can just set a preference (this is essentially what the button does).</p>
<p><code>extensions.firebug.consoleexport.active [boolean, default=false]</code></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step2: Handle XML packets on the server</strong><br />
Now you need to specify server URL where to send the logs (XML packets). This is done through another preference.</p>
<p><code>extensions.firebug.consoleexport.serverURL [string, default=\"\"]</code></p>
<p>Here is an example server side script (PHP) that receives XML packets and stores them into <em>consoleexport.log</em> file.</p>

<p>It’s still a little difficult to get your hands on a device that can run Firefox OS right now, but if you’re interested in running the UI tests a device is not essential. This guide will show you how to run the tests on the nightly desktop builds we provide.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Download the latest desktop build</h3>
<p>The Firefox OS desktop build lets you run Gaia (the UI for Firefox OS) and web apps in a Gecko-based environment somewhat similar to an actual device. There are certain limitations of the desktop client, including: it doesn’t emulate device hardware (camera, battery, etc), it doesn’t support carrier based operations such as sending/receiving messages or calls, and it relies on the network connection of the machine it’s running on.</p>
<p>You can download the latest desktop build from <a href=\"http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/b2g/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/\">this location</a>, but make sure you download the appropriate file for your operating system. Unfortunately, due to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=832469\">bug 832469</a> the nightly desktop builds do not currently work on Windows, so you will need either Mac or Linux (a virtual machine is fine) to continue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mac: b2g-[VERSION].multi.mac64.dmg</li>
<li>Linux (32bit): b2g-[VERSION].multi.linux-i686.tar.bz2</li>
<li>Linux (64bit): b2g-[VERSION].multi.linux-x86_64.tar.bz2</li>
</ul>
<p>Once downloaded, you will need to extract the contents to a local folder. For the purposes of the rest of this guide, I’ll refer to this location as $B2G_HOME.</p>
<p>If a profile is specified when running the tests (recommended), a clone of to profile will be used. This helps to ensure that all tests run in a clean state, however if you also intend to launch and interact with the desktop build manually I would recommend making a copy of the default profile and using the copy for your tests.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Acknowledge the risks</h3>
<p>When running against a device, there’s a very real risk of data loss or unexpected costs. Although it’s much less likely when running against the Firefox OS desktop build, there’s still potential for data loss. For this reason you must create a test variables file to acknowledge this risk. You can find more details for how to do this <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Gaia_Test_Runner#risks\">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Populate your test variables</h3>
<p>Now that you have a test variables file, you can (optionally) add test variables that might be required by certain tests. For example, if you want to run the e-mail tests, you must provide valid e-mail account details. You can read more about the test variables <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/gaia-ui-tests#test-variables\">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Run the tests!</h3>
<p>You will need to have <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\">git</a> and <a href=\"http://www.python.org/getit/\">Python</a> installed (I recommend using version 2.7), and I highly recommend using <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv\">virtual environments</a>.</p>
<p>First, clone the gaia-ui-tests repository using the following command line, where $WORKSPACE is your local workspace folder:</p>
<pre>cd $WORKSPACE
git clone git://github.com/mozilla/gaia-ui-tests.git gaia-ui-tests
cd gaia-ui-tests</pre>
<p>If you’re using virtual environments, create a new environment and activate it. You will only need to create it once, but will need to activate it whenever you wish to run the tests:</p>
<pre>virtualenv .env
source .env/bin/activate</pre>
<p>Now you need to install the test harness (gaiatest) and all of it’s dependencies:</p>
<pre>python setup.py develop</pre>
<p>Once this is done, you will have everything you need to run the tests, using the following command:</p>
<pre>gaiatest --app=b2gdesktop --binary=$B2G_HOME/path/to/b2g-bin --profile=$B2G_HOME/path/to/gaia/profile --testvars=/path/to/testvars.json --restart --type=b2g-xfail gaiatest/tests/manifest.ini</pre>
<p>You should then start to see the tests running, with output similar to the following:</p>
<pre>starting httpd
running webserver on http://10.0.1.12:61016/
TEST-SKIP | test_clock_add_alarm_multiple_times.py | device=desktop, app=B2G
TEST-SKIP | test_play_3gp_video.py | device=desktop, app=B2G
TEST-SKIP | test_gallery_delete_image.py | device=desktop, app=B2G
...
TEST-START test_settings.py
test_get_all_settings (test_settings.TestSettings) ... ok
test_set_named_setting (test_settings.TestSettings) ... ok
test_set_volume (test_settings.TestSettings) ... ok
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 5.246s
OK</pre>
<p>You see more skipped tests, and these are simply tests that are not appropriate to run on the desktop build.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We also have a subset of these tests running against the desktop build in <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\">Travis CI</a>. Click the following build status image for details of the latest results. <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/gaia-ui-tests\" title=\"Travis CI results for mozilla/gaia-ui-tests\"><img alt=\"Travis CI results for mozilla/gaia-ui-tests\" src=\"https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/gaia-ui-tests.png?branch=master\" /></a></p>
<h3>Step 5: Contribute?</h3>
<p>Now you can run the tests, you’re in a great position to help us out! To contribute, you will need to set up a github account and then <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/gaia-ui-tests/fork_select\">fork the main gaia-ui-tests repository</a>. You will then need to update your local clone so it’s associated with your fork rather than the main one. You can do this with the following commands, replacing $USERNAME with your github username:</p>
<pre>git config remote.origin.url git@github.com:$USERNAME/gaia-ui-tests.git
git fetch origin
git remote prune origin</pre>
<p>You can now create a branch, and make your changes. Once done, you should commit your changes and push them to your fork before submitting a pull request. I’m not going to cover these steps in detail here, as they’re fairly standard git practices and will be covered in far better detail elsewhere. In fact, <a href=\"https://help.github.com/\">github:help</a> has some fantastic documentation.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a task, you should first check the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/gaia-ui-tests/issues?labels=desktop\">desktop issues list</a> on github. If there’s nothing available there, see if you can find an area that needs more coverage. Feel free to add an issue and a comment to say you’ll work on it.</p>
<p>You can also ask us for tasks! There are several mailing lists that you can sign up to: <a href=\"https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-automation\">Automation Development</a>, <a href=\"https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/mozwebqa\">Web QA</a>, and <a href=\"https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/qa-b2g\">B2G QA</a>. We’re also on IRC, and you can find us in <a href=\"http://mibbit.com/#automation@irc.mozilla.org\">#automation</a>, <a href=\"http://mibbit.com/#mozwebqa@irc.mozilla.org\">#mozwebqa</a>, and <a href=\"http://mibbit.com/#appsqa@irc.mozilla.org\">#appsqa</a> all on irc.mozilla.org.</p>

Avoiding data copies often requires careful API design. The Web has two facilities that are very useful for writing such APIs: <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-Blob\">Blobs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#concept-transferable-neutered\">ArrayBuffer neutering</a>. </p><p>A Blob is a chunk of generic immutable data, optionally with a MIME type. Its contents are not directly byte-addressable, enabling browsers to easily offer multiple implementations of Blob under the hood. For example, in Gecko we support Blobs backed by in-memory buffers, Blobs backed by files, and Blobs that reference lists of other Blobs they are the concatenation of. Because Blob contents are immutable, it's easy for multithreaded or multiprocess browser implementations to safely share Blob contents in any situation without copying (including, for example, Blobs being passed between Workers via structured cloning). Any Web API dealing with generic data chunks that don't need to be byte-addressable or easily mutable should probably use Blobs, or at least support Blobs as an option. </p><p>ArrayBuffer is part of the Typed Arrays spec; it represents main-memory data that is directly addressable and mutable. Because preventing in-memory data races is an important principle of the Web platform, ArrayBuffers cannot be directly shared between Workers. Therefore we added to the Web the ability to transfer ownership of an ArrayBuffer's data between workers (and the main thread) via the Transferables abstraction. An ArrayBuffer is normally represented as a small JS object containing an internal pointer to a (usually much larger) buffer containing its elements. When an ArrayBuffer is transferred from one thread to another, the ArrayBuffer on the origin thread is neutered --- i.e. its length becomes zero; its element buffer is detached and ownership transferred to the destination thread; and on the destination thread a new ArrayBuffer object is created wrapping the transferred element buffer. The contents of the element buffer are not copied. </p><p>ArrayBuffer neutering is potentially useful for more than just transferring ownership between Workers. Some Web API methods take ArrayBuffers or typed arrays as parameters, and have to copy the data internally for later use. For example, WebGLRenderingContext.bufferData has to validate its ArrayBuffer parameter's contents and copy the data for later use --- otherwise the caller could modify the ArrayBuffer after the bufferData call has returned, and defeat any validation that was performed. If it's helpful for performance, we can add a version of bufferData that neuters its ArrayBuffer parameter and takes ownership of the data instead of copying it. </p><p>Web Audio is an interesting case. Web Audio AudioBuffers contain ArrayBuffers containing audio samples. AudioBuffer samples are made available to an audio processing thread. The question is, what happens if those sample ArrayBuffers are modified by the main thread while the audio processing thread is using them? If the memory is naively shared, the answer is \"data races\", which are unpopular with many people (including me). One way to fix this without adding copying is to allow an AudioBuffer to neuter its ArrayBuffers, taking ownership of their element buffers and making them immutable so no copying is needed but there's also no possibility of data races. </p><p>When designing new Web APIs, if copy avoidance is important, we should keep ArrayBuffer neutering and Blobs in mind as possible solutions.</p>" nil nil "f3843518a4b959fd4cb4191e29cc9af3") (365 (20966 37489 867053) "http://dutherenverseauborddelatable.wordpress.com/2013/07/17/chrome-workers-now-with-modules/" "David Rajchenbach Teller: Chrome Workers, now with modules!"

Firstly, import the module loader:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">// Import the module loader.
// You only need to do this once per worker, but doing it several times is ok.
importScripts(\"resource://gre/modules/workers/require.js\");
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This defines a global value <tt>require()</tt>, that you may now use as follows:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">// Import the module
// (here, we import the core of OS.File)
let Core = require(\"resource://gre/modules/osfile/osfile_shared_allthreads.jsm\");
// We may now use module osfile_shared_allthreads. Since it exports a value |declareFFI|, let's try it:
Core.declareFFI(...)
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note that, for the moment, <tt>require()</tt> only accepts absolute URIs. If the your module URI ends with “.js”, you can omit the extension.</p>
<h3>Creating modules</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Creating a module is just as trivial.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A module is a file, whose filename generally ends with either “.js” or “.jsm”, and designed to be opened through <tt>require()</tt>. Any value you define in that file is private by default. To make the value public, you just have to add it to either global value <tt>exports</tt>, as follows:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">/* File myModule.js */
let secretKey = \"this is a secret\";
let publicKey = \"this is public\";
exports.key = publicKey;
// secretKey is not exported
// publicKey is exported with name \"key\"
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alternatively, if you prefer that style, you may write</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">// variable |module| is a special global introduced by require()
module.exports = {
key: publicKey
};
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once this is done, we may load the module and use the values that have been exported</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">// Assuming that myModule.js is installed to resource://gre/modules/myModule.js
let Module = require(\"resource://gre/modules/myModule.js\")
foo(Module.key); // Module.key == \"this is public\";
// However, secretKey is not exported and cannot be used
</pre>
<h3>Stack traces</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately, the module loader doesn’t play nicely with error stack traces. That is, the following will not show human-readable stacks:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">try {
MyModule.foo();
} catch (ex) {
log(\"Exception raised at \" + ex.fileName)
log(\"Stack: \" + ex.stack);
}
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rather, you should use properties <tt>moduleName</tt> and <tt>moduleStack</tt>, as follows:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">try {
MyModule.foo();
} catch (ex) {
log(\"Exception raised at \" + ex.moduleName)
log(\"Stack: \" + ex.moduleStack);
}
</pre>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is all you need to know to use the module loader. Have fun!</p>
<h3>Subtleties</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You shouldn’t mix both styles <tt>exports.foo = bar</tt> and <tt>module.exports = {foo: bar}</tt>. If you do, know that any call to <tt>module.exports</tt> will overwrite all calls to `exports.foo = bar.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You should not modify <tt>exports</tt> or <tt>module.exports</tt> once your module initialization is complete.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The module loader supports cyclic calls to <tt>require()</tt>. However, if you have cyclic requirements, some of the modules involved in the cyclic requirements may become visible by the other modules before they are fully evaluated.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No attempt is made to fully isolate modules from each other. In particular, globals (<tt>String</tt>, <tt>Math</tt>, <tt>Object</tt>, <tt>self</tt>) and the worker global scope itself (<tt>this</tt>) are shared between workers. In other words, the true isolation unit is the worker itself, not the module.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul><li>The \"Locally\" tab shows the ITS state of the container element of the selection. The ITS state is computed from the local ITS attributes, the global ITS rules applying to the element and potentially the ITS state inherited from the ancestors of the element (the inheritance rules of ITS 2.0 are fully implemented). That tab of course allows to override that local state and apply local attributes.</li>
<li>Three data categories are implemented under the current contract: Translate, Localization Note and Terminology</li>
<li>The \"Global\" tab allows to create and manipulate global ITS rulesets attached to the document, either inline (through a <code><script type=\"application/its+xml\"></code> element) or external (through a <code>link</code> element). The order of rulesets attached to the document can be modified. Parameters and ITS rules can be added to the rulesets or moved into the rulesets. During a creation of a ruleset, both XPath and CSS query languages are available. The rule creation/modification dialog has a magic button computing automatically an Xpath or CSS selector for the currently selected element. All global properties defined by the spec are editable with respect to the cardinality defined by the spec. For XPath, the code looks for an already defined HTML namespace in the ITS rules and adds one (that is reported to the user) if that namespace is not present.</li>
<li>Parameters are correctly expanded in XPath and CSS selectors during global rules' application.</li>
<li>All operations are undoable.</li>
<li>The code was architectured with extensibility in mind and it will be pretty easy to add new ITS 2.0 data categories in the future.</li>

The work that the team agreed they wanted to explore pre-badgecamp all fits in with the concepts outlined in the board slides. We split the (growing) Open Badges team into smaller focused groups, and divided up the work. The goal is to have something to demo or present at badgecamp. By the end of camp, we’ll have a solid roadmap for the next couple of months. The rest of this post is me explaining my thinking on the pre-badgecamp projects, as preparation for the big get together.</p>
<h3>Chicago Summer of Learning Learnings</h3>
<p>From the launch of OpenBadges 1.0 in March until June, the badges team worked with the City of Chicago (and others) to launch the <a href=\"http://chicagosummeroflearning.org\">Chicago Summer of Learning</a>. The largest citywide open badge system ever. The project and outcomes are worth a post of their own, so for now I’ll say that it was a difficult project. Tremendously rewarding, super important for the city and for the open badges ecosystem, but taxing for sure. There are lots of details to discuss coming out of the project, and we’re planning on spending at least the first day of camp talking them through.</p>
<p>We learned a few important things. First, what it means to build a product for a community that doesn’t know you and hasn’t already bought into the concept of open badges. We’re fortunate to have worked with a very supportive open-minded community up until this point. Our backpack has UX issues, the community accepts it and works with us to fix it, someone finds a bug, same thing. With CSOL, we put our work out in front of a large group of people who weren’t interested in us, they support the product. It’s an obvious lesson, one that we’ve all experienced individually, but as a team – it was a first. A very valuable lesson.</p>
<p>Second, design driven development is what we’re best at, and it’s not worth trying to deny or reinvent the system. I tried to shorten the development time by running broad design in parallel with the site development. It was a worthwhile experiment, but ultimately proved that we should take time up front to make fundamental design decisions. It doesn’t mean we’re running a waterfall project, but it does mean we need to have a solid handle on what we want to build before we just start building stuff. Think of it as agile with a slightly more cautious first week or two of up front work. At camp, ><a href=\"http://twitter.com/iamjessklein\">Jess</a> will get to say, “I told you so” for no more than 3 minutes.</p>
<p>Like I said, there’s lots of learning from the project, I don’t want to spend this entire post figuring it out, so I’ll leave it for now with a third (and final) CSOL takeaway – building a team that invents things is different from building a team that executes based on a pre-existing template. The fact is, the badges team is a team of deep thinkers who are amazing at proving or disproving the validity of an abstract idea. CSOL was a problem solved largely by elbow grease, phone conferences and grinding out code. I’m excited that the core open badges team is moving back towards designing the future of badges. We’ll find more sustainable ways to execute the next CSOL level project that don’t cut into the kind of work we’re good at.</p>
<h3>The Backpack</h3>
<p>The <a href=\"http://backpack.openbadges.org\">Mozilla Open Badges Backpack</a> has been online for a year and a half now. It’s allowed users to collect over 100,000 badges so far. It’s an important piece of software, what’s next for it? It’s a big topic, so we divided into two teams – a “what do we do with the backpack <em>now</em>?” team, and a “what will the backpack be in the <em>future</em>?” team. It’s possible, actually pretty likely, that those two teams are actually working on two separate products, that the second team will conceptualize something that’s way different from the current backpack. I hope they do. Innovation in the open education world is starting to level off. Everyone is developing things that are versions of something that already existed. I want to see this team propose something wholly different and wonderful, Willy Wonka level innovation. Wallpaper that tastes like fruit. That sort of thing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the current backpack has 100,000 badges! That’s a pretty big responsibility. Here’s the thing though – if you’ve been on a community call in the past year or so, you’ve probably heard us refer to the backpack as “a reference implementation.” The implication is that the Mozilla backpack is just something to prove a concept. That’s not the case anymore. People are using it, they’re collecting important information about themselves there, we have to treat that with respect and make sure they have the best possible experience. The first step is to clean up the implementation. Fix long-standing bugs, monitor production in a way that makes it easier for us to find bugs before our users. A lot of the thinking around the operationalization of the backpack comes from the launch of CSOL. We learned a lot about quick launches and monitoring in the run up to CSOL, we’re applying that thinking to the backpack now. There’s plenty more in the works as well, including another pass at UX / UI enhancements. We saw a huge improvement with the 1.0 launch, we’re due for another overhaul, both to streamline badge earners workflow and to match the branding we established back in March. We want our backpack to be a place that encourages users, not challenges them.</p>
<h3>Open Badges Infrastructure</h3>
<p>For 1.0, <a href=\"http://weblog.lonelylion.com/category/mozilla/feed/\"http://twitter.com/brianloveswords\">Brian</a> nailed signed assertions, a revised assertion spec that allowed alignment to standards and a slew of other extensibility features and opened the door to alternative authentication systems. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/toolness\">Atul</a> prototyped Backpack Connect, a backpack specification that gives users the ability to directly connect trusted issuers to their backpack, allowing the trusted issuer to put badges directly in the users backpack.</p>
<p>Next on the list is Federation, best described as “the user has a backpack someplace, their badges should go there.” Federation implies two things (maybe more), 1) a backpack has a standard interface that it implements at a minimum. Things like “accepts badges”, “authenticates a user”, “authenticates a badge” are all things that a backpack should do. Without a common standard of backpack behavior, we can’t treat any backpack like any other. 2) If there’s a bunch of backpacks out there and a bunch of issuers, and a user earns a badge on some issuer, how does the issuer know where to send the badge? At its simplest, the user would tell the issuer where their backpack is. We’re discussing (animatedly – it’s kind of a hot topic now, which means its fun to talk about) some sort of magical directory service, that’s both distributed and centralized enough that it’s easily discoverable but not a dumb fat server sitting out there in the world. When you combine the two pieces, you get an infrastructure that supports the holy grail of badge issuing, “I have earned a badge from issuer x, it goes into my backpack (that I host on my desktop) magically, but safely and verifiably.” That’s the story I’m interested in building. When it’s done, and you peek behind the curtain, it’s probably going to be strange and unmagical, but on the surface, I want the user to know as little about their backpack as possible, as little about the issuer as possible and everything just comes together. We’ve been compiling research <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/wiki/%5Bresearch%5D-Federation\">here</a>, and plan on presenting a version of what we want to build to the openbadges-dev list soon.</p>
<p>The flipside of the Federation coin is Discoverability. What interfaces can an issuer give that makes their badge offerings discoverable by indexing systems? A tangent, but related idea – what opened standards are already out there in the world that we should use in the OBi? I started a small list <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/wiki/%5Bresearch%5D-Related-Standards\">here</a> but am sure it’s only a start. I’d like us make sure we understand the geography of the various groups out there pursuing similar goals. My guess is, things like discoverability will be easier to execute if we borrow from other similar standards, which will also make the OBi more interoperable with existing products and services.</p>
<h3>There’s More</h3>

automation</em> or just <em>automation</em>. The output of all this automation
can be seen at <a href=\"https://tbpl.mozilla.org/\">tbpl.mozilla.org</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll give an overview of how all this automation works
followed by a critical analysis identifying what I like and what I
feel should be improved.</p>
<h3>How Firefox automation works</h3>
<p>Let's take a journey through what happens when you push a new revision
of <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/\">mozilla-central</a> (the main
Firefox repository) to Mozilla's canonical Mercurial server. (For
Mozilla people, this journey is roughly the same regardless of which
automation-enabled project branch you push to.) While Firefox's
automation infrastructure kicks off builds on
<a href=\"https://tbpl.mozilla.org/\">several platforms and operating systems</a>,
for simplicity reasons, I'm going to limit low-level technical details
to our 64-bit Linux builds.</p>
<p>Before I begin, a disclaimer: I'm not a subject expert in much of
what I'm about to say. There are people who spend a magnitude more time
than myself touching the systems I'm about to describe. If I get
something wrong, please contact me and I'll update this post.</p>
<p>Let's begin.</p>
<h4>Buildbot</h4>
<p>The heart of Firefox's build automation is a piece of software called
<a href=\"http://buildbot.net/\">Buildbot</a>. Buildbot is essentially a glorified
job scheduling system. I find the
<a href=\"http://buildbot.net/#/basics\">buildbot basics</a> covers, well, the basics
pretty well. What you need to know is that Mozilla maintains a
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot/\">buildbot repository</a> that
appears to contain the buildbot core plus basic customization for
Mozilla.</p>
<p>There are buildbot <em>masters</em> and <em>slaves</em>. <em>masters</em> do all
the coordination and scheduling; <em>slaves</em> do all the real work (such as
compiling Firefox). Mozilla operates a handful of masters and a few
thousand slaves.</p>
<p>When you push code to a project branch (like <em>mozilla-central</em>), a
buildbot master sees the push then figures out what needs to happen. For
<em>mozilla-central</em>, the push gets translated to a request to build on
several different platforms. These requests then go to a scheduler
(possibly getting collapsed into a single request). These requests then
get turned into jobs that run on slaves.</p>
<p>This logic mostly lives in the
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot-configs/\">buildbot-configs repository</a>.
Of particular interest is the
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot-configs/file/e8b27b8b7216/mozilla/config.py\">config.py</a>
file, which pretty much defines how buildbot is configured at Mozilla -
at a high-level anyway.</p>
<p>When a scheduled job executes, the high-level job request is converted into
low-level actions (or <em>steps</em> in buildbot parlance) that get executed on
slaves. For example, a request to build might clone the source
repository, run client.mk, package the results, etc. This logic lives
in the
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbotcustom/\">buildbotcustom repository</a>.
It's worth highlighting the
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbotcustom/file/bdcca6f7b6c2/process/factory.py\">factory.py</a> file. This file contains the beef of the logic
for converting high-level jobs into actions on slaves. Start at the
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbotcustom/file/bdcca6f7b6c2/process/factory.py#l379\">MozillaBuildFactory class</a>
class to see exactly what goes into performing a build. Then move on to
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbotcustom/file/bdcca6f7b6c2/process/factory.py#l1338\">addDoBuildSteps()</a>,
which contains the command for invoking the actual build system. As you
can see, there's a lot that goes into building besides just invoking the
build system (like most developers do)!</p>
<p>For many automation jobs, there is an additional component that comes
into play: <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/mozharness/\">mozharness</a>.
<em>mozharness</em> is relatively new to the Firefox build automation
landscape so you may not be familiar with it. A goal of <em>mozharness</em> is
to largely migrate the low-level logic from <em>buildbotcustom</em> - the logic
that converts a high-level job request into low-level buildbot <em>steps</em>
(typically command invocations) - into a separate, standalone entity
that doesn't depend on buildbot. A goal is to enable developers to run
mozharness locally and run automation jobs just like the official
automation infrastructure does. If you have time, I encourage you to
read the
<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozharness_FAQ\">mozharness FAQ</a>
to learn more. My understanding is <em>mozharness</em> will eventually power
<strong>all</strong> of the jobs currently defined in <em>buildbotcustom</em>, so I
recommend getting acquainted with <em>mozharness</em>.</p>
<p>In the <em>mozharness</em> world, automation jobs are defined as <em>scripts</em>.
Here's the
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/mozharness/file/84187194b050/scripts/marionette.py\">marionette script</a>.
You just execute a script (with ideally as few arguments as possible)
and <em>mozharness</em> does the rest. In buildbot, instead of having a job
with say 12 steps and this logic for configuring the steps live in
buildbot, buildbot just says <em>run the marionette mozharness script</em>.
Since very little business logic now lives in buildbot, this essentially
reduces buildbot's role to just job scheduling.</p>
<p>And that is essentially how the automation determines what to run. Now
let's talk about the machines automation runs on.</p>
<h4>Machine provisioning</h4>
<p>Earlier, I said Mozilla operates thousands of buildbot slaves. Let's
talk about how those slaves come into existence.</p>
<p>A slave is just a fancy name for a machine, either physical or virtual.
These machines are owned or operated by Mozilla. Mozilla either buys
a physical machine or rents one from a <em>cloud provider</em>, like Amazon
EC2.</p>
<p>For hopefully obvious reasons, it is important for the configuration of
these machines to be consistent. Let's talk about how that is done. Keep
in mind I'm talking about Linux machines. OS X and Windows machines go
through a different procedure.</p>
<p>When a new machine is acquired, it needs an operating system. There is a
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/6f7b4a33af2c/setup/centos6-kickstart.cfg.erb\">kickstart config file</a>
that installs CentOS 6.2. At the end of the base OS flash/install, it
configures Puppet to talk to a central Puppet master. This Puppet
infrastructure is called
<a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/PuppetAgain\">PuppetAgain</a>
and its files are stored in the
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/\">puppet repository</a>.</p>
<p>Puppet is let loose on the fresh OS install and eventually the machine
is configured so it is homogenous with other similar machines in the
automation infrastructure. Presumably, Puppet continually polls the
central Puppet master and applies the latest configuration.</p>
<p>Part of the <em>puppetization</em> of this machine involves installing the
buildbot client. The client eventually registers with the buildbot
master and waits for jobs to process.</p>
<p>So, we've described how machines are provisioned as buildbot slaves and
how buildbot jobs are converted to actions/steps/commands to be
performed on slaves. Let's examine a job in more detail.</p>
<h4>Running a build job</h4>
<p>Before I talk about the details of a build job, it's worth mentioning
that nearly everything I described up until this point is largely hidden
from view from most Firefox developers. As far as I know, things like
Puppet logs are hidden from public view. And there shouldn't be anything
terribly wrong with that: the Puppet configs are public, after all.
Unless you are affiliated with Release Engineering or the Automation and
Tools Team (A*Team) or hack on a component that warrants its own piece
of automation, you probably aren't too concerned with how all of this
works.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's finally time to start talking about something almost every
Firefox developer has done: build Firefox from source.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, code in <em>buildbotcustom</em> (to be replaced by
<em>mozharness</em> someday) is responsible for turning a Firefox build job
into a series of actions/steps/commands to run on a slave. And, lucky
for us, the activity of a slave is captured and saved to text log files!
If you've ever used <a href=\"https://tbpl.mozilla.org/\">TBPL</a>, you've almost
certainly clicked a link to view one of these logs.</p>
<p>In this section, I'll describe the steps performed in
<a href=\"https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/mozilla-central-linux64/1371941584/mozilla-central-linux64-bm62-build1-build35.txt.gz\">this log</a>
from a recent <em>mozilla-central</em> build on a 64-bit Linux machine.
I will be paying particular attention to steps that affect the
build environment (for reasons that will be revealed in my critique
below).</p>
<p>If you load our log of interest next to
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbotcustom/file/bdcca6f7b6c2/process/factory.py#l764\">factory.py</a>
from <em>buildbotcustom</em>, you can start to see how they are related.
You may notice <em>self.addStep()</em> calls in <em>factory.py</em> correspond to
<em>========= Started</em> ... <em>========= Finished</em> sections in the log.
That's no accident: every <em>addStep()</em> call produces a section like
that in the log.</p>
<p>Now let's look at some of those steps in detail.</p>
<p>The job/log contains a number of <em>set property</em> steps. Search for
<em>set props</em> and you'll find them in the log. These steps define named
properties in a hash map buildbot uses to represent the current
configuration/state. Think of these properties as a way for buildbot to
communicate metadata between masters and slaves.</p>
<p>One of the first interesting steps we see is the cloning of the
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools\">tools repository</a>. Search for
<em>Started clone build tools</em> and you'll find it. This repository contains
a lot of support tools and scripts used by all parts of automation.
There's lots of useful tools in there!</p>
<p>Skipping over the steps that check whether to clobber the builder or
purge old content from disk, the next build steps relevant to our
interests involve the population of a <em>mock</em> environment.
Search for <em>Started mock-tgt mozilla-centos6-x86_64</em> to find it in the
logs.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock\">Mock</a> is a piece of
software that manages <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot\">chroots</a>.
It was written by the Fedora project for creating isolated build
environments for software packages. For reasons unknown to me,
Mozilla runs a forked version of mock called
<a href=\"https://github.com/jhford/mock_mozilla\">mock_mozilla</a>.</p>
<p>The build job creates a fresh mock environment on every build. (This is
clearly indicated by the <em>INFO: chroot
(/builds/mock_mozilla/mozilla-centos6-x86_64) unlocked and deleted</em>
line in the log.) Later on, builds are performed inside this mock
environment. This means that every build job is mostly isolated from
both the underlying operating system and all build jobs that came
before.</p>
<p>You can see the creation of the new mock environment by looking for the
<em>mock_mozilla -r mozilla-centos6-x86_64 --init</em> command in the log. This
is using the <em>mozilla-centos6-x86_64</em> configuration file to create the new
environment. This file is managed by Puppet, so you can
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/6f7b4a33af2c/modules/mockbuild/files/mozilla-centos6-x86_64.cfg\">see it</a>
in the <em>puppet</em> repository. The
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/6f7b4a33af2c/modules/mockbuild/files/mozilla-centos6-x86_64.cfg#l11\">setup command</a>
on line 11 is the most important line in this file: it defines what
commands to run to initialize the new mock environment.</p>
<p>Populating the mock environment takes a number of buildbot steps. After
copying a bunch of files into the mock/chroot, the mock environment is
further initialized by installing a number of packages. Search for
<em>Started mock-install</em> in the log. Yum is being used to install a number
of packages required to build Firefox. This package list appears to
come from
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot-configs/file/e8b27b8b7216/mozilla/config.py#l208\">config.py</a>
in the <em>buildbot-configs</em> repository. These packages are downloaded from
a Yum repository hosted by Mozilla. Altogether, 249 new packages
consuming 821 MB are installed during this step!</p>
<p>After the <em>mock</em> environment is created, the <em>mozharness</em> repository is
removed, re-cloned, and updated to the <em>production</em> branch. After that,
we pull changes from <em>mozilla-central</em> and update the local checkout to
the revision we've been told to build.</p>
<p>If you search for <em>Started got mozconfig</em>, you'll find where the
<em>mozconfig</em> file (the build system configuration file) is acquired.</p>
<p>After that, the
<a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Applications/Tooltool\">tooltool</a>
configuration is consulted. Tooltool is essentially a content-addressable
file store: files are stored and retrieved by the hash value of their
content. A manifest file inside <em>mozilla-central</em> defines the set of
files to fetch from tooltool at build time. At this step of the build,
that file is consulted and listed files are downloaded. While the Linux
manifest is currently empty, the
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/e7e9726025da/browser/config/tooltool-manifests/macosx64/releng.manifest\">OS X tooltool manifest</a>
defines the digest of the Clang archive to use to build the tree.</p>
<p>Since tooltool files are addressed by content (not merely by name), this
means that the same file will be fetched no matter when the build runs.
In other words, behavior is constant as the contents of the tooltool
repository itself change (or at least it should be).</p>
<p>After <em>tooltool</em> contents sync, we finally arrive at the actual build
step. Search for <em>Started compile</em> in the log. The important detail here
is that <em>mock_mozilla</em> is used to build firefox with <em>client.mk</em> inside
the fresh mock/chroot environment.</p>
<p>After building, we move on to other tasks, such as creating a
distributable package, running tests, etc. I'm just going to glance over
them because there's a lot going on and it would take a long time to
explain it all! I encourage you to look at the steps in the log and
learn.</p>
<p>While these steps are going on, the buildbot master is notified that the
build and packaging aspect of the job has completed (sometime before
<em>make check</em> is executed). Upon receiving this success notification, the
buildbot master scheduled derived jobs, notably all the test suites
(reftests, mochitests, xpcshell tests, etc). This scheduling occurs
before <em>make check</em> has completed so overall turnaround time is reduced
as much as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, at the end of the log, the slave/machine is rebooted. At this
point, the job has finished. TBPL colors the <em>B</em> next to the job green
to signal successul completion. The slave waits for its next job from
the buildbot master.</p>
<p>And that is how Firefox is built! I could go into details for all of the
derived test jobs, but I won't, as that would take a lot of effort! I
leave that as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>The Firefox build automation is complex and composed of many pieces.
It's a testament to a lot of people's hard work that it works as well as
it does!</p>
<p>From my experience at a previous job managing large numbers of servers
in a production datacenter, I commend Release Engineering for deploying
Puppet to help ensure the machines performing Firefox's build automation
are in a consistent state. I also like how <em>mock</em> is used to mostly
isolate build jobs from one another. These are both very important to
ensure Firefox is built consistently over time.</p>
<p>The on-going migration of automation logic from <em>buildbotcustom</em> to
<em>mozharness</em> is a fantastic project and I hope it is completed soon.
I hold hope that one day we can integrate <em>mozharness</em> into the local
development workflow (likely transparently through tools like <em>mach</em>)
and local developers can invoke actions using the same code path as the
official automation infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Areas for improvement</h3>
<p>The Firefox build automation largely works well. And I don't mean to
take away from that. However, there are a number of areas where
things could be improved. In this section, I'll talk about some of them.</p>
<p>Before I get into details, let me share an experience I had about a year
ago.</p>
<h4>A tale of modifying the xpcshell test harness</h4>
<p>In April 2012, I was writing a lot of JavaScript testing code and was
frustrated at how difficult it was to share test helper code between
tests. I filed
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748490\">bug 748490</a>
to request a new feature in the JavaScript test harnesses: the ability
to create testing-only JavaScript modules that weren't shipped as part
of Firefox. This would encourage code reuse among tests and make writing
tests easier. I thought it would be a relatively simple feature to
implement!</p>
<p>And, it was. At first. The initial implementation landed two weeks after
I filed the bug (it didn't require too much effort, but I was busy with
others tasks). It landed without incident. Although, nothing was using
it and there was no test coverage. However, my local development started
relying on it and things were working just fine.</p>
<p>When I <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755196\">attempted</a>
to actually land a test that made use of this new feature, it failed
because the new directory for these shared modules
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755339\">wasn't being archived</a>.
Simple enough to fix, right? Wrong. Start reading
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755339#c4\">bug 755339 from comment #4</a>.
It is a trail of agony. I had to uplift my change to all
the major branches. Then, once that was done, <em>buildbotcustom</em> could
be updated. Uplifts were performed on May 24. <em>buildbotcustom</em> was
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755339#c15\">pushed out to production</a>
a week later on May 31. It immediately
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755339#c16\">broke the world</a>.
At the time, philor says it was the worst tree bustage he'd ever seen.
Literally every tree was red. Achievement unlocked. A workaround
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755339#c17\">was quickly devised</a>
on May 31 (after the <em>buildbotcustom</em> change was backed out to restore
working automation) and landed. Again, it had to be uplifted to all the
trees. This patch conflicted when applied on older trees and I
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755339#c23\">accidentally committed a typo</a>
and broke beta, release, and esr in the process. I got an earful for
breaking these trees and lost a lot of <em>street cred</em> with the sheriffs
(who are charged with keeping law and order in the land of the source
trees). The <em>buildbotcustom</em> change
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=757460#c21\">finally landed</a>
on June 7 and stuck.</p>
<p>Finally, my initial idea of adding testing-only JavaScript modules had been
implemented and was available for all to use. It only required uplifting
a patch to all project branches, having Release Engineering reconfigure
<em>buildbotcustom</em>, and breaking all the trees in the process. This
experience was truly WTFOMGBBQ. And, the agony above was from adding a
seemingly innocuous feature to a single test harness. Can you imagine
what it's like to add a new test harness to automation?!</p>
<h4>In-tree automation configs different from Release Engineering's</h4>
<p>The above example demonstrates many shortcomings in the current
automation infrastructure. The first one I will talk about is that the
in-tree automation configs (how to perform a specific automation job,
such as run an individual test harness) are almost completely different
from what Release Engineering runs on the official infrastructure!</p>
<p>A year ago, <em>mozilla-central</em> had
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/e24391ffbe7e/testing/testsuite-targets.mk\">testsuite-targets.mk</a> -
a make file defining targets like <em>xpcshell-tests</em> and
<em>mochitest-plain</em> that allowed developers to run these test suites
locally. Release Engineering had <em>buildbotcustom</em>, which didn't use
<em>testsuite-targets.mk</em> at all. While invoking most test harnesses is
simply a matter of formulating arguments for a Python script, that logic
was duplicated between <em>testsuite-targets</em> and <em>buildbotcustom</em>.</p>
<p>Today, <em>Release Engineering</em> has been porting job invocation code to
<em>mozharness</em>. And, I have been encouraging people to locally run tests
with <em>mach</em>. Initially, mach commands executed make. However, commands
are now bypassing make and calling into the Python test harnesses
natively. This allows more advanced behavior since mach has more control
and insight into the underlying test harness. The downside is mach is
now reinventing logic.</p>
<p>So, we now have 3 or 4 separate implementations for performing many of
our automation jobs. Medium term, you figure Release Engineering
consolidates all the <em>buildbotcustom</em> logic into <em>mozharness</em>,
eliminating 1. I also think it is inevitable that <em>testsuite-targets</em> is
refactored to invoke mach commands or is just removed altogether. But
that still leaves us with 2 independent implementations!</p>
<p><strong>I believe we should work towards consolidating the logic for job
invocation to inside mozilla-central.</strong> The commands developers run
locally should be as similar as possible to what runs on official
automation infrastructure. Any differences introduce potential for
different results. Differences also increase the burden to roll out
changes. I would argue that an in-tree change should be all that is
necessary to change the behavior of official automation infrastructure.</p>
<p>How this is accomplished, I'm not entirely certain. In my ideal world,
I think <em>mozharness</em> would live in tree. Although, I understand that may
not be practical because much of what <em>mozharness</em> does involves
downloading just-built packages, uploading results to a server, etc. I
think a middle ground that accomplishes most of what we seek is for the
Release Engineering configs (<em>mozharness</em>) to contain as little logic as
possible for actual job invocation and let something in-tree do the
rest. For example, the <em>mozharness</em> job for the xpcshell test harness
would simply be <em>execute the run-xpcshell-tests script from the tests
archive.</em> <em>mozilla-central</em> could then have full domain over what
exactly is done. If <em>mozilla-central</em> changes, everyone picks up those
changes immediately.</p>
<h4>Local run-time environments different from official ones</h4>
<p>Similar in vein to the previous section is that there are discrepancies
between local run-time environments and official ones. By run-time
environment, I mean the state of the operating system (installed
packages, configuration settings, etc). This plays an important role in
determining how an automation job executes. An obvious example is the
compiler toolchain. GCC 4.5 is obviously going to have different
behavior from GCC 4.7.</p>
<p>While Release Engineering has taken steps to ensure consistency in the
configuration of the machines powering the official automation
infrastructure, local machine configurations are effectively living in
the wild west. Developers are effectively unable to recreate the
official automation environment. This lowers the liklihood that a local
build will have the same outcome when performed on official automation
infrastructure.</p>
<p>While supporting diverse run-time environments will result in greater
compatibility and is thus a good thing, I think it is important that
local developers have the ability to recreate the official run-time
environment as closely as possible. This will raise confidence that
local results can be trusted and should cut down on development
cost by reducing the number of Try pushes and reducing development
cycles.</p>
<p>Recreating the official run-time environment varies in difficulty
depending on the operating system. For Linux, it should actually be
pretty easy! For the build environment, Mozilla simply needs to package
the <em>mock</em> environment used to build or at least could publish a script
used to create said environment. In
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=886226\">bug 886226</a>, I
made an initial stab at this by creating a Vagrantfile that will
kinda/sorta recreate the official 64-bit Linux build environment. I even
published an archive of the <em>mock</em> environment (which can be imported
into <em>Docker</em>). As pointed out on the bug, my work isn't perfect. But
it's a start. And it's better than what developers have today to
reproduce the official environments.</p>
<p>If we decide publishing archives of chroot environments is the way to
go, I believe we could extend the Linux solution to OS X as well. OS X
has chroot. It also has a sandboxing facility (<em>man sandbox</em>). There are
also tools like <a href=\"http://freecode.com/projects/jailkit\">jailkit</a>. Also,
using chroot environments will also likely make our automation faster
since using archives will almost surely be faster than recreating the
environment on every job run.
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=851294\">Bug 851294</a> has
been filed to track this.</p>
<p>What about Windows? Well, I don't know. We sort of have an environment
with <a href=\"https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-Latest.exe\">MozillaBuild</a>.
But, it's not isolated from the rest of the operating system like chroot
environments are. Modulo Windows, two out of three tier one platforms
isn't too bad!</p>
<p>Now, even if the software environment is similar, hardware differences
can also affect results. Unfortunately, there's little that can be done
on this front aside from having everybody use the same hardware models.
That's not going to happen. So let's pretend we don't have that problem.</p>
<h4>Configurations change over time</h4>
<p>I recently wrote a
<a href=\"http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2013/06/24/the-importance-of-time-on-automated-machine-configuration/\">post on the importance of time on machine configurations</a>.
The gist is that configurations always pulling from version control tip
or relying on external resource often vary with time and aren't truly
idempotent. This makes it difficult to reproduce specific configurations
at future points in time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mozilla's build automation is highly susceptible to
configuration variance over time. There are many examples.</p>
<p>The buildbot configuration is periodically pushed to the
infrastructure. A job will inherit the config that is currently
deployed. If you make a backwards incompatible change to the buildbot
configs and push an old revision of mozilla-central, things will blow
up.</p>
<p>There are two time-dependent aspects of Puppet bootstrapping. First, the
Puppet configs (like buildbot configs) are periodically pushed to a
central master server. Whichever version is deployed at a given time is
the version picked up by the automation job. Second, we don't do a good
job of pinning versions inside the Puppet config. Here are the
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/6f7b4a33af2c/modules/packages/manifests/mercurial.pp\">Mercurial</a>,
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/6f7b4a33af2c/modules/packages/manifests/mock.pp\">mock</a>,
and <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/6f7b4a33af2c/modules/packages/manifests/mozilla/py27_mercurial.pp\">Python</a>
manifests using the <em>latest</em> package version. This means if a new
version of a package is added to
<a href=\"http://puppetagain.pub.build.mozilla.org/data/repos/yum/\">Mozilla's Yum repositories</a>
that new package version will be deployed on the next Puppet sync.
This is definitely not time independent. Fortunately, the base operating
system configuration for Linux isn't terribly important because of the
<em>mock</em> environment. But, it still varies.</p>
<p>Like the base operating system, the mock environment is full of
dependence on time. First, the config file itself is managed by Puppet
and thus susceptible to its time-dependent behavior. Second, the
packages installed in the mock environment aren't version pinned.
This means that whatever packages deployed in
<a href=\"http://puppetagain.pub.build.mozilla.org/data/repos/yum/\">Mozilla's Yum repositories</a>
will be used. So, every time the Yum package repository is updated, we
potentially switch the configuration of our build environment. On the
surface, this terrifies me. Maybe we have a strict update policy in
place to prevent excessive package updates. The
<a href=\"http://puppetagain.pub.build.mozilla.org/data/repos/yum/mirrors/centos/6/latest/os/x86_64/\">modified times</a>
of packages on the server seems to indicate that. Even if we didn't
update the package repository, it still seems a bit fragile: I'd much
prefer to pin package versions everywhere than rely on the content of
a Yum server.</p>
<p>The default branch of the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools\">tools repository</a>
is always checked out at build time. As new revisions are added to this
repository, builds will pick them up immediately. If you make a
backwards incompatible change to the tools repository, old revisions may
no longer build.</p>
<p>The production branch of the
<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/build/mozharness/\">mozharness repository</a> is
always used during jobs. Again, if <em>mozharness</em> changes, every future
job sees these changes.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is that many of the tightly-related
systems/repositories aren't linked in any way. The automation
configuration simply pulls the tip of each. We run into problems when we
wish to make backwards incompatible changes. If you make one, you first
have to update all repositories to be compatible. This is a huge pain
(see my experience above). Furthermore, it makes it impossible to have
successful automation runs from old revisions of those repositories!</p>
<p>The solution to this mess is to pin versions and configs everywhere.
The repositories being put through automation (namely <em>mozilla-central</em>)
should contain revisions of the configs to use. It should say <em>I want to
use revision X of mozharness, revision Y of the build machine
configuration, etc.</em> This will enable much more consistent automation
output over time. It cuts down on surprises (<em>did behavior change on July
14 because of a change to mozilla-central or to a new automation config
being rolled out to the server?</em>). It allows people to build very old
packages. This means Mozilla wouldn't need to store terabytes of old
builds around (we could just trigger the build again and get the same
output).</p>
<p>I recognize that deterministic automation configuration is likely not
completely achievable. But, that doesn't mean we shouldn't work towards
it. Having something better than today enables so many more useful
scenarios and flexibility in our automation. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Say you want to add or remove a test harness. Or, maybe you want to add
a required argument or remove an obsolute argument from a test harness.
The procedure from doing this today is far from trivial. It's not enough
to simply land your change in mozilla-central and be done with it. Instead,
you need to land support in <em>buildbotcustom</em> or <em>mozharness</em>, prepare to
land in mozilla-central, then coordinate with Release Engineering to have your
changes landed around the time of a server deployment. And since changes
likely affect multiple trees, you're likely also landing things in
inbound, fx-team, services-central, possibly aurora, beta, and release,
etc. If you aren't landing in aurora, beta, release, esr, b2g, etc, you
need to remember to have your change merged into these server configurations
when those trees inherit your code (although Release Engineering is
typically pretty good about tracking this and doing it for you).</p>
<p>Contrast this with simply making a backwards incompatible change by
checking in support in <em>mozharness</em> then making the change in
<em>mozilla-central</em> along with a revision bump of the <em>mozharness</em>
revision to use. When that changeset is pushed to the infrastructure, a
compatible version of <em>mozharness</em> is used. When that change gets merged
into other trees, the appropriate <em>mozharness</em> revision is used. No
extra work needed. Utopia. You just made A*Team and Release Engineering
much more productive by eliminating a lot of overhead.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Mozilla automation infrastructure is a complex beast. There are many
moving parts and separate systems. Any newcomer to Mozilla should simply
stand in awe that so many systems seemlessly work so well together.</p>
<p>There are improvements that can be made, sure (especially in the area of
deterministic behavior over time). But, I think with the <em>mozharness</em>
work and the <em>Puppetization</em> of the server infrastructure that Mozilla
is on the right course. I look forward to a future where the source code
in <em>mozilla-central</em> and the automation infrastructure are more tightly
integrated. We're trending there. Give it time.</p>" nil nil "d49997832104f71d666c2e87be894008") (356 (20966 20559 66358) "http://felipe.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/fisl-14/" "Felipe Gomes: FISL 14" "felipe" "Tue, 16 Jul 2013 09:42:54 +0000" "<p><a href=\"http://felipe.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/995698_10151445516746594_351212263_n1.jpg\"><img alt=\"Firefox, Tux and Gnu at FISL\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-347\" height=\"313\" src=\"http://felipe.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/995698_10151445516746594_351212263_n1.jpg?w=500&h=313\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>
<p>Two weeks ago, almost the entire Mozilla community in Brazil assembled together in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre\" title=\"Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil\">Porto Alegre</a> to attend <a href=\"http://fisl.org.br/14/\" title=\"FISL 14\">FISL</a>, the largest free software conference in the country, which brings together about 7000 people every year to talk about every side of open source: communities, business, government, education, etc.</p>
<p>I think the community had its best attendance ever this year. For one thing, it was the largest group: there were about 30 contributors from all over the country who contribute to every area of Mozilla. For another, our participation this year was entirely planned and run by the community, and everyone was working together in sync to make it a success.</p>
<p>Our activities included various talks on the main conference track, an apps hackaton, a Mozilla room, SUMO sprints, and just a lot of engagement with the students and developers at the conference. As expected, interest in Firefox OS was very high, and this brought to us a lot of people who wanted to hear more about the OS, take a look at the devices (we had a few Geeksphones for demonstrations!) and learn how to build apps. With the dedicated Mozilla room we were able to run several “Apps 101″ sessions to get people started on apps and the hackaton (at times back-to-back sessions to keep up with the demand!), and to provide a welcoming place for them to hack on the apps or to get some hands-on help when they needed.</p>

<p>With all that, what I have to say is thanks to all the contributors who helped with all our activities. It was great to meet again some of the old-timers and specially nice to meet the newer members of the community to whom I had only known online before. I was very impressed with everyone’s dedication and passion for Mozilla! Attending FISL is always a special experience for me because that’s where I started my true involvement with open source and Mozilla. After meeting Marcio and Fabricio in São Carlos in 2005 and been following things online for a while, I attended my first FISL in 2008 where I gave a presentation about add-ons development and there I met Chofmann, Blizzard, Taras, Mitchell, Mary, and that was a big push for me to start contributing. I’ve been attending the event ever since, and nowadays I often get people asking my story and how they too can get involved and I hope that I can too serve as support and inspiration for the new people joining who wants to participate and grow in the community. Last but not least, a special thanks to Sérgio for being the lead organizer and volunteering an incredible amount of his time in the past N months to make FISL happen this year!</p>
<p>Until FISL 15!</p>

David Baron: Ten years of the Mozilla Foundation" "David Baron" "Mon, 15 Jul 2013 20:53:00 +0000" "<div>
<p>Ten years ago today, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/netscape.public.mozilla.general/2JdTRcleoJE/rAXQNL3LGLcJ\">the
Mozilla foundation was incorporated</a>.  This was a major step forward
for the Mozilla project; for the project's first five years or so, it
lived within Netscape / AOL / AOL Time Warner.  Those first five years
were also pretty closely aligned with when I was in college, so although
I was quite closely involved with the Mozilla project by the end of that
period, I wasn't in the best of positions to observe and understand what
was going on.</p>
<p>The Mozilla Foundation gave us an entity with a clear set of goals
that fit the values of the Mozilla community.  That's far from saying
that everyone had the same values, and there's certainly been debate
about what Mozilla stands for.  But having an organization whose goal is
to promote openness and innovation on the Web has given us the chance to
move the Web forward and to work on behalf of users in a way that we
couldn't before.</p>
<p>Ten years ago today was also the day that AOL laid off or transferred
what was left of the team that it paid to work on Mozilla software.  It
was widely known at least a day or two in advance that the layoffs were
coming.  The night before the layoffs (a Monday night), I remember
working late at the office.  I'm not sure what I was working on, but I
remember Brendan sending some documents by fax (faxes were ancient even
then), I think because they were needed as part of setting up the
foundation.</p>
<p>The Mozilla Foundation was set up with substantial support from AOL.
I was part of a transition team of employees who were laid off effective
the end of September, so that we could spend that two and a half months
getting Mozilla running independently and moving the existing hardware
we depended on.  AOL also <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/press/mozilla-foundation.html\">provided
two million US dollars</a> as initial funding for the foundation.</p>
<p>Setting up a small company was certainly an adventure.
I remember some trips with chofmann to look at office space.  (If you
thought our <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/photos/112631487287840879898/albums/5735052542846127889\">original
office</a> was horrible, you should have seen the
other places we looked at!)  I remember helping myk and chofmann move
machines into our colo space and into our new office.
By the fall, we were settled into the new office, Ben was working
through the feature list for Firefox 1.0, and Mozilla was operating in
its new home.</p>
<p>A small company and the much larger Mozilla community were able to do
big things.  A little over a year later, we shipped Firefox 1.0, which
showed that the browser wasn't dead, and the Web could continue to
grow.</p>

However, because release builds need to be built with a few special flags (to enable the correct branding, update channel, etc.) we need to maintain separate mozconfigs for them. In the past we’ve sometimes forgotten to carry forward new compiler flags (eg, enabling PGO) from nightly -> release. To alleviate this problem, we built a tool that compared the mozconfigs of nightly and release builds, and complained about any differences that weren’t whitelisted. This tool has worked very well for us for a few years now, but because it runs as part of pre-release checks, it has the downside of catching the problems in the critical path of the release — leaving us scrambling to fix them quickly.</p>

This means that problems of this nature will now be caught whenever they land — even on Try. This means that anyone who changes a “nightly” or “release” mozconfig now needs to make a few decisions. The following is intended to help decide what needs to happen when making such a change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should my change to a nightly mozconfig apply to releases too?</li>
<ul>
<li>If yes, change the “common-opt” mozconfig (eg: https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/config/mozconfigs/win32/common-opt)</li>
<li>If no, add the line to platform’s “nightly” whitelist (https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/config/mozconfigs/whitelist)</li>
</ul>
<li>Should my change to a release mozconfig apply to nightlies too?</li>
<ul>
<li>If yes, change the “common-opt” mozconfig (eg: https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/config/mozconfigs/win32/common-opt)</li>
<li>If no, add the line to platform’s “release” whitelist (https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/config/mozconfigs/whitelist)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>When I told you June was active in terms of events in the new Mozilla office in Paris, I was not joking… With the opening week hardly over, a new event was taking place: the Pre Summit.</p>
<p>Next October, Mozilla is holding a \"Summit\": a gathering of Mozillians from all over the world. The previous Summit took place in Canada in 2010. Since then there have been no Summits, but instead \"Mozcamps\" on separate continents. The reason for this is simple: the exponential growth of the Community has continued non-stop in recent years.</p>
<p>But Mozilla really wants an opportunity for its contributors and employees to meet, with all the continents intermingled. Thus the organization of a new Summit! Except, since the Community has become too large for the places that might accommodate it, the October 2013 Summit will be distributed over three cities: Brussels, Toronto, and San Francisco. A lottery allows contributors to choose locations that are not necessarily the closest to where they live.</p>
<div id=\"magicdomid16\">The organization for all this started six months ago. Contributors were invited, via \"Mozillians\" to register. And now that the citites, the hotels, and logistics are set, the work needs to shift to content.</div>
<p id=\"magicdomid19\">This is why Mozilla organized a \"Pre Summit\" on 15 and 16 of June, in Mozilla Office in Paris. I was glad to be invited, with David Scravaglieri (Firefox OS manager for Europe) and Laurent Jouanneau (long-time contributor and founder of Xul.fr) to represent France. Alongside contributors from all over the world, and many employees. We were a total of about a hundred people.</p>

<p>This weekend was englightening and rewarding!</p>
<p>Themes had to be defined, what would be the orientation of this future Summit. What would it be useful for. It has to be more than a mere gathering of Mozillians: Mozilla is an association, and cannot afford to spend money mindlessly. It also has to make sure that the event will be rewarding for every attendee.</p>
<p>We were all there, happy to meet again or for the first time. Glad to see that Mitchell and Debbie Cohen, among many others, were present. And soon enough we understood that this weekend was the one Mozilla wanted to hear us, and I would say, to listen and understand us.</p>
<div id=\"magicdomid32\">Through many workshops, we discussed, and learned from each other, shared our vision for Mozilla. So we, quite simply, said all that was weighing on us, because we don’t live in a dream world. Despite the fact that Mozilla’s approach unites us, it remains true that this project can be a source of frustrations or worries, for us who give it so much of our energy.</div>
<p>So here are in a few points without a specific order, what are my take-aways from this weekend, that will remain very important for my future engagement in the community:</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid38\">- Melek, Gloria (from Columbia), Arturo (from Venezuela) and I used this weekend as an opportunity to report our dismay about the fact that Webmaker cannot be localized. I don’t hide the fact that several people were surprised about this fact. Which is an obvious fact about Mozilla’s quick growth: it’s impossible to know everything about it. And we were right in our roles as Reps by mentioning this issue. And the expectations about Webmaker are high for good reasons! This project is so thrilling! But how can you efficiently teach what is the Internet to children who do not know a word in English, while the tools we offer are in English?</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid41\">In France, the Ministère de la Culture is interested in a kind of partnership around Webmaker. But we can only tell them no as of now: young French children under ten (and of more than ten too) would not be able to use it.</p>
<p>The language barrier is a reality for many of us.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid47\">- This is also an issue we raised: as Reps, we are listening to our communities, and mentioned that Mozilla is too much \"North-America-centered\", and that different cultures have difficulties finding their place.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid50\">All the Reps were complaining. And in the coming days and months, we will be there to make sure our cultures are taken into account. BUT there is that one thing that was important to me: the fact that we could have talked. And that we felt listened-to.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid53\">Who other than Mozilla would be able to gather employees including executives and volunteers in the same room? We were able to exchange with all the attending directors: Debbie Cohen, Mitchel Baker and many others. We were able to explain our griefs. I found that is fantastic!</p>
<p>Mozilla has about 800 employees and thousands of contributors. It offers tools used by millions of people, and still cares enough to listen and creates moments when we can say it all. It is unique and deeply moving!</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid59\">There were strong moments, English-speakers showing how much they were able to make efforts: each time they spoke too fast, non-native speakers only had to raise a hand for the flow to slow down. And it worked! It was a simple and efficient way to raise awareness.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid65\">- More generally-speaking, a major topic quickly covered by contributors (which group I belong to) was our feeling of being abandoned by employees becoming stronger and stronger. The impression that our work did not get attention nor recognition and to lack help. These few months, as Reps we heard so many complaints coming from contributors, so many of them mentioning the possibility of leaving… That is why this weekend was much needed. On my side, it boosted my motivation, reminded me why I contribute to the Mozilla project, and why we can be proud of being part of the Mozilla community.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid66\">Even though several people tried to calm the tensions down around the employee/contributor divide that we, as Reps, mentioned, by reminding us we are all \"Mozillians\".</p>
<p>It’s true! We are all Mozillians. But it’s impossible not to distinguish between employees and volunteers. As volunteers, we give our time OUTSIDE of our work. For that reason I really think that volunteer contributions should be honored more. And it’s true that we need recognition and help from the employees. Because for all of us, they are our point of entry, the ones who know the nitty-gritty and can guide us through it.</p>
<p>I also listened to what the employees had to say. They were affected and distressed by what we had said, since they felt they were doing their best and making all the resources they could available to us — and they are not wrong, in my opinion!</p>
<div>
<div id=\"magicdomid77\">Because after all, have you seen the new Paris ofice?</div>
<div id=\"magicdomid78\">And the budget Mozilla allowed us for our francophone meetup?</div>
<div id=\"magicdomid79\">And the Summit?</div>
<p>So yes, as contributors, we are not there to let our behavior be dictated to us, we are not just a \"workforce\" available to do whatever the employees don’t have time for.<br />
And yes, we are all concious of the differences between employes and volunteers. But we have employees who are dedicated, and by organizing the Summit, Mozilla shows that it wants its employees to meet us and learn from us.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid88\">And that is extraordinary!</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid92\">As to the fact that we sometimes feel neglected by the employees:</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid93\">Firstly, do not generalize! Don’t forget all the employees who engage with us, all those who constantly answer our questions on IRC, email, etc. There are many of them.</p>
<div>
<p>A new system has been created, the Mozilla Reps system. And I never stop marvelling at the availability of William, Pierros, Konstantina, and Brian. They understand the Community, and they are wonderful connectors. This Reps system also proves the importance Mozilla places in its Community: a worldwide system, tuned to our needs, that puts so many resources at our disposal!</p>
<p>Finally, let’s ask ourselves: what is more important? That employees come to our events, or that they produce the best possible tools that benefit all of us? In the case of Firefox OS, Vivien (Tech Lead for Gaia) always tells me, and I think he is right, that what he’s working on is the biggest contribution he will ever make, his greatest gift to the community. And I agree with him!</p>
<p>We must accept that the employees can’t be at our disposal all the time. They are not in our service; well, a few are but not all. As employees they work under constraints that are different from those of volunteer contributors (in terms of efficiency, productivity, etc.). So naturally they don’t always respond instantly. It’s our role to be patient, and to nag them. <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" />   And don’t forget that the Reps are also there to help you, and to act as an interface.<br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<p>After all, we all agree that it can be difficult to know whom to contact, where to get information, etc. Mozilla has become so huge! And this is just the beginning!</p>
<p>That’s why we spent time this weekend thinking about the best tools to let all of us interact better, and know each other better. Better tools, and fewer. Because it’s becoming really difficult to follow everything Mozilla offers! (Of course I gave my usual rant against Bugzilla, the arch-nemesis of Joe and Jane User.)</p>
</div>
<p>I’d really like to thank all the employees for their patience. I know that this weekend, especially Saturday, spent listening to our complaints must have been painful at times. But that did not last!</p>
</div>
<p>- Because this is the magic of Mozilla! On Sunday, when the time had come to propose constructive solutions for working together productively, everyone worked hand-in-hand. Forgotten were the tensions of the previous day! We were united by a common goal: making the Summit a success, a time of joy for all the attendees, and the starting point for a new era.</p>
<p>Together we proposed themes and workshops. In particular regarding ways to welcome new contributors, to help them feel comfortable, and also to keep the existing community member engaged. We all worked in the same direction, around an oh-so-important theme: the future of Mozilla. We all started debating it, and then building it. And we will continue during the Summit itself. A Summit that will probably be very different than we’ve seen in the past: fewer lectures, and more interactions and interest groups.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid120\">Anyway, that’s what we began over the course of the weekend: we racked our brains and exchanged ideas. And we saw just how incredibly productive this mix of experiences and cultures could be. We all left with smiling faces, and a feeling of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Which was a beautiful thing on Sunday! And it will be beautiful at the Summit!</p>

<blockquote><p>Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life. — <a href=\"http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=648294\">Confucius?</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Sure it’s a little cliché, however I am hoping that this is the case. In the past at least this has been true of my volunteer work. As well as at the university (I was a teaching assistant of sorts). Even when I worked at <a href=\"http://www.homebase.co.uk/\">Homebase</a> this held true to some degree.</p>
<p>There are many sayings to inspire and motivate people in their jobs. This is not something I feel I need. I don’t need to be inspired, or motivated, by a saying to prepare me for what I am about to do. Having had over 7 years experience with the community I now work for, I know for a fact that the community is all the inspiration, and motivation I need. The community combined with a kick ass mission. <strong>Promote openness, innovation & opportunity on the Web</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know what the day will hold for me (I’m on a train to work right now so it’s all yet to come). What I do know is that if I was any more excited I’d die.</p>
<p><img alt=\"It's so fluffy I'm gonna die!\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/yii.wduyck.com/content/fluffy.2013-07-15.jpg\" /></p>
<h3>An ulterior motive?</h3>
<p>Well… not a sinister or bad one. My working at Mozilla will help me to a degree. Quite literally. This is a part of my <a href=\"http://yii.wduyck.com/2013-07-10\">Year In Industry</a>, which in short is a year out of studies where I must work somewhere. At the end of it I write a report on what I’ve learned, and it goes towards my degree.</p>
<p>Other than this tiny indiscretion I assure you that everything is above board. I’m thrilled to be able to work at Mozilla. The chance to work full time for the betterment of the web is an honor.</p>
<h3>Still a volunteer?</h3>
<p>Yes and no. It’s a hard line to draw, but there is definitely going to be things I do that are in that grey area of work, and not work. Where it’s still all about Mozilla.</p>
<p>What this internship means to me is that I now don’t have to split my focus between my studies, Mozilla, and my social life. Now I get to split it between Mozilla, Mozilla, and a social life (<em>shock horror a geek with a social life!</em>).</p>
<h3>More to come</h3>
<p>So I’m now going to be more active than I’ve ever been, or even had the opportunity to be. This includes blogging. I’ve now got two blogs that I <strong>am</strong> going to maintain. One for my <a href=\"http://yii.wduyck.com/\">university</a>, and one to let the Mozillaverse know what I’ve been working on / will be.</p>
<p>I’ll also be on a number of community calls, hacking on code, and much more.</p>
<p>As for some kind of a schedule… you can expect a blog post every Friday on my main blog, and at least once a week (no set date) on my university blog.</p>
<p>In the mean time… I’ve got to start working, and stop being excited to start, and start being excited to be working <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/blog.wduyck.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>

<p>I think it’s fair to admit that I am a secret <a href=\"http://www.opera.com/\">Opera Software</a> fan, especially on their ability to deliver many of the browser innovations (Opera had it first!) we see today and relative independence within the browser arena.</p>
<p>Yet, recently, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5245576\">posts are</a> <a href=\"http://my.opera.com/hallvors/blog/goodbye\">popping up</a>, revealing inconvenient truth of the inner-working of the company, and confirm the reasons behind it’s rational move to Chromium.

<p>Obviously, stay relevant in the browser arena is hard. Mozilla is <a href=\"https://brendaneich.com/2013/02/why-mozilla-matters/\">working hard on that</a> too, either with new technologies like <a href=\"http://asmjs.org/\">asm.js</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/servo\">Servo</a>, or newly gain influence from the new product <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/\">Firefox OS</a>.

<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=859573\">now records</a>
system resource usage (CPU, memory, and I/O) during mozharness jobs.
It does this by adding a generic resource collection feature to
mozharness. If a mozharness script inherits from a specific class, it
magically performs system resource collection and reporting!</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that the current state of the feature is far from
complete. There are numerous shortcomings and areas for improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the time I'm writing this, the mozharness patch is only
deployed on the Cedar tree. Hopefully it will be deployed to the
production infrastructure shortly.</li>
<li>This feature only works for mozharness jobs. Notably absent are
desktop builds.</li>
<li>psutil - the underlying Python package used to collect data - isn't
yet installable everywhere. As Release Engineering rolls it out to
other machine classes in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=893254\">bug 893254</a>,
those jobs will magically start collecting resource usage.</li>
<li>While detailed resource usage is captured during job execution, we
currently only report a very high-level summary at job completion
time. This will be addressed with
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=893388\">bug 893388</a>.</li>
<li>Jobs running on virtual machines appear to misreport CPU usage
(presumably due to CPU steal being counted as utilized CPU).
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=893391\">Bug 893391</a>
tracks.</li>
<li>You need to manually open logs to view resource usage. (e.g. open
<a href=\"https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/cedar-macosx64/1373828505/cedar_mountainlion_test-xpcshell-bm77-tests1-macosx-build30.txt.gz\">this log</a>
and search for <em>Total resource usage</em>.) I hope to one day have key
metrics reported in TBPL output and/or easily graphable.</li>
<li>Resource collection operates at the system level. Because there is
only 1 job running on a machine and slaves typically do little else,
we assume system resource usage is a sufficient proxy for automation
job usage. This obviously isn't always correct. But, it was the
easiest to initially implement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are a lot of shortcomings! And, it essentially means only OS X
test jobs are providing meaningful data now. But, you have to start
somewhere. And, we have more data now than we did before. That's
progress.</p>
<h3>Purpose and Analysis</h3>
<p>Collecting resource usage of automation jobs (something I'm quite frankly
surprised we weren't doing before) should help raise awareness of
inefficient machine utilization and other hardware problems. It will
allow us to answer questions such as <em>are the machines working as hard
as they can</em> or <em>is a particular hardware component contributing to
slower automation execution.</em></p>
<p>Indeed a casual look at the first days of the data has shown some
alarming readings, notably the abysmal CPU efficiency of our test jobs.
For an OS X 10.8 opt build, the
<a href=\"https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/cedar-macosx64/1373828505/cedar_mountainlion_test-xpcshell-bm77-tests1-macosx-build30.txt.gz\">xpcshell</a>
job only utilized an average of 10% CPU during execution. A
<a href=\"https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/cedar-macosx64/1373828505/cedar_mountainlion_test-mochitest-browser-chrome-bm77-tests1-macosx-build26.txt.gz\">browser chrome</a>
job only utilized 12% CPU on average. Finally, a
<a href=\"https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/cedar-macosx64/1373828505/cedar_mountainlion_test-reftest-bm77-tests1-macosx-build21.txt.gz\">reftest</a>
job only utilized 13%.</p>
<p>Any CPU cycle not utilized by our automation infrastructure is forever
lost and cannot be put to work again. So, to only utilize 10-13% of
available CPU cycles during test jobs is wasting a lot of machine
potential. This is the equivalent of buying 7.7 to 10 machines and only
turning 1 of them on! Or, in terms of time, it would reduce the wall
time execution of a 1 hour job to 6:00 to 7:48. Or in terms of
overall automation load, it would significantly decrease the backlog and
turnaround time. You get my drift. This is why parallelizing test
execution within test suites - a means to increase CPU utilization - is
such an exciting project to me. This work is all tracked in
<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=845748\">bug 845748</a> and in
my opinion it cannot complete soon enough. (I'd also like to see more
investigation into bottlenecks in test execution. Even small
improvements of 1 or 2% can have a measurable impact when multiplied by
thousands of tests per suite and hundreds of test job runs per day.)</p>
<p>Another interesting observation is that there is over 1 GB of write I/O
during some test jobs. Browser chrome tests write close to 2GB! That is
surprisingly high to me. Are the tests really incurring that much I/O?
If so, which ones? Do they need to? If not tests, what background
service is performing that much work? Could I/O wait be slowing tests
down? Should we invest in more SSDs? More science is definitely needed.</p>
<p>I hope people find this data useful and that we put it to use to
make more data-driven decisions around Mozilla's automation
infrastructure.</p>" nil nil "60d1b7d7523f22c5f71aaa71d0d180d8") (336 (20963 44454 492933) "http://chrislord.net/index.php/2013/07/13/getting-healthy/" "Chris Lord: Getting healthy" "Chris Lord" "Sat, 13 Jul 2013 08:58:36 +0000" "<p>I’ve never really considered myself an unhealthy person.

<p>This is sort of the end of an era for the Bugzilla project… Both Frédéric and Max (who left to work at Google a couple years ago and <a href=\"https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?user=user%40host.com&list=developers&func=archive-get-part&extra=201211/3\" target=\"_blank\">stepped down from his position earlier this year</a> for lack of time) have been with the project for much longer than most people ever stick with a single employer in IT-related jobs (of which an open source project of this magnitude has a lot of similarities). For an open source project, that’s outright amazing, as people tend to come and go a lot in most projects. It’s kind of surprising that I’ve been around longer than them, but I’m kind of a “lifer” in some ways, and in reality I’ve had a good break from the project for the last few years because Max and Frédéric have been mostly taking care of everything while I’ve been busy with other things.</p>
<p>So it’s time to begin a new era. Since I’ve had a good break to clear the monotony I’m going to be trying to get more involved myself again (which I’ve been saying ever since Max left, but I have a lot more incentive now). I’d also like to kickstart a new team to lead the project, and kind of re-organize if you will. We have a number of positions within the project for various functions, which we’ve never really paid attention to as people moved on. So some questions we’ll be asking at our upcoming meeting are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What positions in our existing structure do we have open?</li>
<li>Do we still need them all?</li>
<li>Are there new positions we have a need for that we should create?</li>
<li>Who should fill them?</li>
<li>Do the existing holders of positions that we still need and haven’t been vacated want to keep doing them?</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have some other “reinventing the project” type topics while we’re at it. There’s a number of things we’ve been talking about doing for a long time that we never really moved on, and some of the big elusive dreams (the big UI overhaul!) have actually been making progress as well, lately. When we’re in the middle of big changes like this, I think it’s a good time to review where we are, get everyone on the same page, and tackle some of these things we keep talking about.</p>
<p>We also have a lot of new useful technology at our disposal since the last time we had a project meeting.  We’re going to experiment with using Google Hangouts for the meeting this time, and using their feature to stream the Hangout via YouTube for those who want to watch without participating.  We’ll also keep our usual meeting IRC channel open so people who don’t have a Google+ account and don’t want to get one can still participate and ask questions via IRC.</p>
<p>The preliminary agenda and participation instructions have been posted at <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings\">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings</a>.  The meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 17th, at 14:00 UTC. And before anyone complains about the time, this was the best time to avoid inconveniencing the largest number of people.  The Bugzilla Project has a global pool of contributors, and we have active contributors in a wide variety of time zones.  The time chosen puts the meeting in the middle of the night for the fewest number of people.  Those on the west coast in the US will probably have to get up a little early, and those in eastern Australia will be up a little later.</p>
<p>A lot of the emails and comments I’ve gotten since Frédéric’s announcement have been really positive, so I’m encouraged by the number of people who are still committed to keeping Bugzilla vibrant!  We’ll see you at the meeting on Wednesday!</p>" nil nil "5b6691793ea7188509a09e70f9644995") (334 (20963 44454 491366) "http://armenzg.blogspot.com/2013/07/google-2-step-verification-and-how-to.html" "Armen Zambrano Gasparnian: Google 2-step verification and how to set up an Android device, a desktop computer and a FirefoxOS phone" "Armen Zambrano G."

Given that I’m neither a web developer, nor a devops engineer, it may seem a little odd to some that I attended at all, but I have a good reason, I swear! We (the Necko team at Mozilla) wanted to investigate the existing web performance landscape to (1) ensure we weren’t doing something that web developers/ops didn’t expect (thus harming performance), and (2) see if there was anything we could do to help improve performance within the framework of what developers already expect. The good news is that I wasn’t taken completely by surprise by anything at the conference, so we’re not doing anything horrifyingly wrong. Even though there weren’t a whole lot of surprises, I still got a lot of good information, and I wanted to touch on some of that here.</p>
<h3 id=\"chrome_chrome_everywhere\">Chrome… Chrome <em>everywhere</em>.</h3>
<p>Given that I’m a Mozillian, I wanted to keep a (very informal) count of the browser distribution I saw in use by a crowd that was overwhelmingly web devs and devops. Google’s Chrome was overwhelmingly the browser of choice in this group. Of the browsers I saw open on people’s screens, I saw</p>
<ul>
<li>No Opera or IE</li>
<li>One Safari</li>
<li>Two Firefox (not including myself and the other Mozillian I knew at the conference)</li>
<li>Everything else Chrome</li>
</ul>
<p>Like I said, this didn’t exactly take me by surprise. My feeling, even before attending the conference, has been that the web developer community greatly prefers Chrome (I’ve heard various reasons for this preference). I’m not knocking Chrome, it is, indeed, a great browser. It still makes me a little sad, though, to see things <em>so</em> skewed in one direction. A little more balance would be good for the web.</p>
<h3 id=\"everybody_loves_rum\">Everybody Loves RUM</h3>
<p>Again, not surprising. Real User Monitoring is pretty much the only way to <em>really</em> prove changes in production for any piece of software, whether it’s a web app or a web browser. There were quite a few sessions on RUM, and it was good to see my team’s intuition on the JS APIs around timing being validated.</p>
<h3 id=\"developing_world_what_developing_world\">Developing world? <em>What</em> developing world?</h3>
<p>OK, this one took me a little bit by surprise. In the sessions I attended, at least, pretty much now one talked about optimizing for content delivery over anything less than a 3G (or even LTE) connection. Not that it wasn’t mentioned at all, but the only time I saw anything like GSM, EDGE, or GPRS mentioned was in an “Oh, yeah, these really slow connections exist, too, and you should probably care about them” sort of way. I know we’re all lucky here in the US (and Europe, and Japan, and …) to have excellent connectivity, but the next big group of people to come online <em>won’t</em> have that kind of connectivity (at least to start), and everyone needs to start thinking about how to best serve those markets.</p>
<h3 id=\"a_little_better_balanced\">A Little Better Balanced</h3>
<p>This is probably the least scientific of my observations (with the possible exception of my browser count), but I noticed that, compared to the last conference I attended (<a href=\"http://us.pycon.org/\">PyCon</a> 2007), there was a better balance between the number of men and women speakers. If I remember correctly (my google-fu failed in finding the speaker list online), there was only one woman speaker at PyCon in 2007 (during a session, not during any of the keynotes). By contrast, my (very) quick count for Velocity showed 10 women speaking (including one of the keynote speakers). Is this better? Yes. Do we still have a <em>long</em> way to go, in terms of equality in tech and tech conferences? That’s a <strong>resounding</strong> yes. Still, it’s encouraging to see progress being made, even if it is painfully slow.</p>
<h3 id=\"http2_questions_and_worries\">HTTP/2 Questions and Worries</h3>
<p>I kind of feel like I want to talk about this more at length, in a blog post of its own, but I feel like I should at least touch on it here. A lot of people were excited about HTTP/2, so that’s good. However, I heard some questions and worries about HTTP/2 (and have since seen similar worries eleswhere on the internet) that were just downright perplexing to me. The most common misperception I saw is that HTTP/2 somehow breaks the request/response model that we’ve all come to know and love from HTTP/1.x. Repeat after me: the semantics of HTTP are unchanged. Let’s say that one more time, all together. The semantics of HTTP are <em>unchanged</em>. Oh, and your app (client-side, at least) shouldn’t (except perhaps in very special cases) have to care whether it’s running on HTTP/1.x or HTTP/2. There now, doesn’t that feel better?</p>
<h3 id=\"lots_of_love_for_webpagetest\">Lots of Love for WebPageTest</h3>
<p>Also not surprising, but great to see. There was a lot of love being shown for <a href=\"https://www.webpagetest.org/\">WebPageTest</a>. If you haven’t checked it out, what are you doing here? Go, look now. What’s left of this post can wait until you read about it, play around it, and see just how awesome it is.</p>

In this post we’ll talk through the components of CSOL badge design and the rationale that led to our decisions about them. First, a quick two sentence recap of what CSOL is and what it seeks to accomplish. The Chicago Summer of Learning is the first citywide implementation of an open badge system. It includes in-school badge-issuing programs as well as out-of-school and governmental badge-issuing programs—all of them focused on combatting the summer learning drop off.</p>
<p>As I’ve discussed in previous posts and as I noted during this week’s Open Badges Community call, there are a number of considerations associated with design and badge design in particular. While it can be argued that content defines a good deal of the social value of a badge, visual appearance also plays a significant role.* Visual processing accounts for half of the human brain’s operational capacity so it follows that how something looks can alter how it’s perceived. With that in mind, as I imagined the visual badge system that would arise from a panoply of organizations issuing disparate badges, my years of experience in design consulting told me that a strong shape with a required set of elements would bring conceptual cohesion, reduce visual confusion, and provide a much needed sense of family, a unifying principle if you will, to the group.</p>
<p><strong>A template to the rescue</strong><br />
With these desires in mind, we created a badge design template that was hexagonal in shape with a banner draped across it that included 2 blue stripes and 4 red stars.</p>
<p><img alt=\"badgetemplate\" class=\" wp-image-717 aligncenter\" height=\"303\" src=\"http://carlacasilli.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/badgetemplate.gif?w=310&h=303\" width=\"310\" /></p>
<p>The banner design referenced the iconic elements found on the City of Chicago’s flag. This template served a variety of purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>it identified each of these badges as Chicago Summer of Learning badges;</li>
<li>it created a cohesive and easily understood family of badges despite being assembled from very different organizations;</li>
<li>it provided the city with an easy way to find, reference, and display badges as a full set not only during the experience but afterwards as well;</li>
<li>it branded the badges as Chicago specific; and</li>
<li>it provided a way for issuing organizations to indicate to the public and to future funders that they had participated in the groundbreaking experience of CSOL.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our goal with the template was to provide a Chicago flavor to the badges and indicate a family feel while allowing enough room for organizations to customize badges to suit their needs. So, how did this fly? This template arrived in a way that may have seemed like an edict to some and yet it was perceived as a gift by others. Nevertheless, with the imposition of such a strong requirement to participate in the system—and it was an absolute requirement for all entry level badges—there were additional issues for the team to work through together. Some organizations already had pre-existing badges that didn’t fit the new template; some organizations had no access to designers; and some organizations had no strong design style or branding to implement.</p>
<p><strong>A badge design tool for all</strong><br />
Since one of our goals for the template was to ease folks’ fear of design in general—particularly those who were organizationally or financially challenged—we also developed a badge design tool. The beauty of this tool, developed by Atul Varma & Jess Klein, was its adaptability. If an organization had little to no design expertise, using it one could pull together a respectable looking badge that had all of the required elements. On the other hand if an organization had experienced design staff or access to professional designers, the template could be manipulated quite easily to accommodate unusual visual elements or objects that extended beyond the hexagonal shape.</p>
<p>For the organizations who already had existing badges, we suggested resizing them and dropping them into the hexagonal portion of the template—or we provided them with an Illustrator template. Since all of the organizations with pre-existing badges had design staff or access to professional designers, this option worked out quite well.</p>
<p><strong>Issues of branding</strong><br />
Since Mozilla was tasked with addressing the first two badge levels of the CSOL experience, entry level badges and city level STEAM badges, we focused solely on a family appearance. To that end, we did not develop standards for color use or typography—two important mainstays of a branding system. However, we did provide some recommendations regarding type use. That suggestion was to avoid using type unless it remained readable & legible at highly reduced sizes. We also suggested avoiding type as the sole indicator of different badge levels, e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced.</p>
<p>Indeed, we shared with the badge issuing organizations that badge design is akin to logotype or mark design in that it has similar constraints. Badges need to read at both small sizes (50 x 50 pixels) and larger sizes (600 x 600 pixels). Happily, most organizations succeeded in making their own branding work comfortably with the new badge template wrapper.</p>
<p>As for the city level STEAM badges, they hewed to the hexagonal structure and incorporated the word Chicago in them. Using her previously designed entry level badge template as a starting point, Mozilla’s Jess Klein designed three sets of beautiful S-T-E-A-M badges. After a comprehensive review and discussion, the larger team selected the style that hearkened back to the Chicago Summer of Learning identity program.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://carlacasilli.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/steam.png\"><img alt=\"CSOL city-level STEAM badges\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-712\" height=\"132\" src=\"http://carlacasilli.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/steam.png?w=625&h=132\" width=\"625\" /></a></p>
<p>See the lovely results above for yourself. Each badge visually references the subject area that it represents; take a moment or two to admire the layered meaning embedded in each one of these badges. They’re wonderful examples of badge designs that function as well as a group as they do independently.</p>
<p>As to the top level badges of the CSOL experience—the city-wide challenge learning experiences badged by Hive Chicago and the Digital Youth Network—they function in a somewhat separate aesthetic because the use of the badge design template was not a requirement for their development. Subsequently, the shapes and colors of the challenge badges issued by these organizations may appear significantly different than the entry level or city-level badges. They do not all retain the Chicago flag banner and they may be shapes other than hexagonal.</p>
<p><strong>Retraining the focus</strong><br />
After all of this discussion of the visual design of the badges, it’s important to consider why this badge system came into being. The learning is what’s important here: the badges act as various representations of that learning. We are really pleased to see the beautiful, mixed bouquet of badges that resulted from working with a simple standard template combined with the challenge badge accents. This summer provides a test bed for not only open badges but also summer programs and the nascent tie between in school and out of school learning. We could not be more excited.</p>

<p>As always, I welcome your thoughts. In the next few blog posts we’ll cover the badge system hierarchy including the type of badge system CSOL represents, thoughts on assessment, team requirements, plus an examination of additional tools built for this endeavor.</p>
<p>So yes, much more soon.<br />

<p><em>notes & references</em><br />
*It’s worth noting that while I strongly suggest that design play a role from the beginning of the process, obsessive concerns about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of the visual appearance of a badge can stunt or entirely inhibit development. Still, content + design = a whole that is unmatched by its individual parts.</p>
<p>During the July 10, 2013 Open Badges community call, I paraphrased a quote by Massimo Vignelli (1998), designer of the iconic <a href=\"http://vignelli.com/home/transportation/nysub.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Vignelli: NYC subway work\">NYC subway map and wayfinding</a>, that I found in an intriguing book of interviews, <a href=\"http://www.hellerbooks.com/docs/interviews_dialogues.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Heller books: Design Dialogues\">Design Dialogues</a>. You can find that quote below.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are two kinds of graphic designers: One is rooted in history and semiotics and problem-solving. The other is more rooted in the liberal arts—painting, figurative arts, advertising, trends and fashion. These are really two different avenues. The first kind is more interested in looking to the nature of the problem and organizing information. That’s our kind of graphic design. To me, graphic design is the organization of information. The other kind is interested in the look and wants to change things all the time. It wants to be up-to-date, beautiful, trendy.<br />
(M. Vignelli, 1998)</p></blockquote>

<p>First of course, it’s fun to excel and I’m very proud of the Mozilla teams that made this happen. Competing with Google is no easy task –Google’s resources are immense and their employees are talented. Kudos to everyone involved.</p>
<p>Second, competition in “our” space is one aspect of success.  When we started building Firefox, no one believed a browser mattered on the desktop, and a lot of people didn’t know what a browser was.  Today that’s not the case.  The introduction of Firefox spurred the browser into prominence, and generated competition first from Microsoft, and then from Google. This competition has validated our message from long ago that creating the product through which people access the Internet has immense impact.  Google will undoubtedly surge ahead on some aspects of performance before too long, we should expect this, rise to meet the challenge and view it as success.</p>
<p>Third, we need to make sure we’re competing in things that matter. A neck-and-neck competition in an area that doesn’t provide value to consumers isn’t a great use of resources. We should periodically evaluate if the thing we’re competing about is worth the focus. Today raw speed is a key competitive area. That makes sense. It’s worth asking if at some point if improvements in raw speed will become overshadowed by needed improvements in other areas, but right now raw speed is important to users.</p>
<p>We’re also working on performance in new areas.  With Firefox  we are also bringing things like high performance <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/06/25/firefox-delivers-3d-gaming-video-calls-and-file-sharing-to-the-web/\">3D games and video calls to the Web</a>.

Addressing these challenges is another step in Mozilla’s mission to advance the Web as the platform for openness, innovation and opportunity for all.</p>
<p>Fourth, great products are key at Mozilla.  Firefox on the desktop allows us to enhance the key aspects of online life we care about.  It will help us connect “the desktop” to “mobile” and provide a unified online experience based on the freedoms and openness that drive us.</p>

We’ve had an ongoing issue with the news-to-mail gateway on some of our newsgroups, and today we figured out what was going on and fixed it.

On the other hand (as far as we know), messages from the mailing lists *were* making it to the newsgroups.  As best as we can tell, this started happening around May 4th or so, due to a corrupted newsgroup at Giganews that caused the gateway script to crash before completing syncing all of the newsgroups.  When the problem was resolved, the newsgroup messages which hadn’t gone to the mailing lists yet all went out at once, so if you subscribe to any of those lists, you may have had a sudden onslaught of email this afternoon.

<p>Just as promised, here is my address given on the Mozilla Paris Office opening ceremony. A speech addressing the community.</p>
<p>\"Good evening everyone,</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid13\">I am here tonight to talk… about you! You all, free software supporters and for most of you members of the Mozilla community.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid14\">This community to which belong both employees and volunteers.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Together we are family, a community similar to the Fellowship of the Ring (from The Lord of the Rings) which gathers people from various origins around common values, which in our case are expressed by the Mozilla Manifesto:</p>
<blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><em>The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that  openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of  the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the  Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone.</em></div>
<div></div>
<div><em>The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create  world-class open source software and to develop new types of  collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in  making the Internet experience better for all of us. </em></div>
<div></div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div id=\"magicdomid30\"><em>The goals for the Manifesto are to:   </em></div>
<div id=\"magicdomid31\"><em>- articulate a vision for the Internet that Mozilla participants want the Mozilla Foundation to pursue; </em></div>
<div id=\"magicdomid32\"><em>- speak to people whether or not they have a technical background;</em></div>
<div id=\"magicdomid33\"><em>- make Mozilla contributors proud of what we’re doing and motivate us to continue; and</em></div>
<div id=\"magicdomid34\"><em>provide a framework for other people to advance this vision of the Internet.</em></div>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it. For all of us, the Internet is a worldwide public ressource that should remain open and accessible, as well as improve everyone’s lives.</p>
<p>The values are great, and in fact essential. This is why I insisted on telling you all my admiration for all that you are doing for the Internet and our rights.</p>
<div></div>
<div>
<p id=\"magicdomid43\">Even though, I must admit that in the beginning I freaked out a bit. With your bold and somewhat childish tee-shirts, your vocabulary and weird discussions (What is the best Linux distribution?), your odd behaviours (since when does one eat with a computer by one’s side?) and so on.</p>
<div></div>
<p>But fear yielded to admiration. When I realised that you gave your energy and time, not to play on your computers (even though I know you do that too <img alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> ), but making sure that the Internet remains a common property, free of constraints, and accessible to the greatest number.</p>
<p>And I have seen several concrete cases.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The latest being last Sunday, while the Hackathon was happening between these very walls, when I saw developers being able to master new techniques and being able to create an app in only a few hours. We are not talking about a website here, but applications able to interact with a device (a phone in this case) and to behave just like a traditionnal application. Enabling the largest amount of people to achieve such things is exactly the motive for Mozilla and its community.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid55\">And today I can’t do without you. <b>And I also know, you should be aware of it, that Mozilla can’t do without you either!</b></p>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>Mozilla has about 800 employees, and moreover some hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of volunteers all over the world.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid62\">Without the community, Mozilla would not be what it is! It has to be clear, the employees alone can’t make the company work. Try competing with Microsoft, Apple, or Google when your budget is roughly equivalent to their cafeteria budget…</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid63\">Students, employees, retired people, and so on, we all have other activity elsewhere.</p>
<p>Despite those other activities, we share a common passion that Mozilla enables us to express.</p>
<div>
<p id=\"magicdomid69\">Mozilla is the possibility to search for a solution to a problem on the Internet from Paris, find the answer in Japan, thanks to a Tunisian contributor.</p>
<p>Mozilla is volunteers who stick to sharing values, exchange and openness such as those we can find in free software and that lead to the invention of the Internet and the Web. For those, Mozilla gives access to resources such as this space, but not only.</p>
<div></div>
<p>For instance, thanks to Mozilla, I was lucky enough to spend a week in Senegal with four employees. During this week we toured the IT universities in Dakar to teach about Internet-related technologies and understand their needs…</p>
<p>Mozilla is Palestine and Israël gathered during common events! Just as Balkans, Greece, and Turkey, thanks to Mozilla.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Last year the \"Mozilla Reps\" programme was created. To this day, we count 363 official Mozilla representatives, all of the volunteers, over the World. From France to Burma, Bangladesh, Peru, Uganda, or a closed country such as Zimbabwe where a \"Reps\" can benefit from help coming from the whole World.</p>
<div></div>
<p>But keep in mind that those \"Reps\" are only the tip of the iceberg. Most of the community consists of discreet people.</p>
<p>I am here to talk tonight, because most of them are too shy or modest to do it themselves.</p>
<div></div>
<p>In this community, there is space for everyone and all sorts of contributions: the \"core contributors\" whose contributions are on par with those of employees except they are not looking to be employed (or are students or retired persons as it often happens); the active contributors, the temporary… But let us not forget about Firefox (and soon Firefox OS) users who belong to the Mozilla family because they made an ethical choice.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Tonight, if you are not a contributor yet, I invite you to join us. We are friendly, have space for everyone and contributions for everyone wishing to help.</p>
<div>
<p id=\"magicdomid96\">Mozilla does not only care about engineering, developers, beared geeks and technical people. Mozilla also cares about education and created a tool we call \"Webmaker\" which enables youngsters and their parents to learn how to make the Web.</p>
<div>
<p id=\"magicdomid99\">But generally speaking, in terms of contributions, we can cater to every taste. You can help with documentation, design, beta-testing, bug reporting, be Mozilla’s face during events, and the list goes on.</p>
<div id=\"magicdomid100\"></div>
<p id=\"magicdomid102\">Each of those contributions is noted and can be highlighted to companies or future employers. And what an experience!</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid105\">The most important being: by contributing, you play your part and know that things are changing for the better.</p>
<div id=\"magicdomid106\"></div>
<p id=\"magicdomid108\">I would like to mention those who often are the \"core\" of local communities: the localizers. It’s a word used in Mozilla to say translators. As of today, Firefox exists in 93 languages. And this thanks to volunteers!</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid111\">93 languages means that 93 groups of people can get easier access to the Internet, and go beyond the language barrier.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid114\">In Africa, we have volunteers translating Firefox into Peul and Songhay… hence people from those groups will be able to browse the Internet, and get access to the World.</p>
<div id=\"magicdomid115\"></div>
<p id=\"magicdomid117\">So I have spoken a lot about various countries since the beginning of my speech, but only a little about France.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid120\">The French-speaking community occupies a special place. It was one of the earliest to be created and among our members are a few \"dinosaurs\", always eager to welcome newcomers.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid123\">This community keeps growing! Both in headcount and area covered! It consists of Belgium, Switzerland, Québec, but also Lebanon, Mauritius, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Chad, Burkina-Faso, and soon Togo and Madagascar.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid126\">Together, and day after day, we  share, enrich, and help each other. Together, we also have a lot of fun.</p>
<p id=\"magicdomid129\">We will all gather in two weeks for the first time here in this office. We will share our experience and set various workshops and course material that we will be able to use. If the visas are cleared of course.\"</p>

Mozilla started the first major bounty program in 2004 for <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/security/bug-bounty.html\">Firefox</a> and later added critical websites in 2010, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/\">Chrome</a> joined in 2010, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/whitehat\">Facebook</a> in 2011 and even <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/report/bountyprograms.aspx\">Microsoft</a> has come around recently in June, 2013.<br /><br /><br />In addition to bounties offered directly through a specific company there are other programs like HP's <a href=\"http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/\">ZDI</a> and also a new on-demand approach to bug bounties for any company offered from <a href=\"http://bugcrowd.com/\">BugCrowd</a><br /><br />But, are bug bounties worth the time to manage, foster the research community, and the cost of the rewards? As someone who has been deeply involved in Mozilla's bounty program my answer has always been a resounding yes.<br /><br />My opinion aside, I'm happy to now also draw attention to a Berkeley Study from Matthew Finifter, Devdatta Akhawe, and David Wagner titled <a href=\"http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~devdatta/papers/vrp-paper.pdf\">An Empirical Study of Vulnerability Rewards Programs</a>. <br /><br />A few select quotes from the study:<br /><br />On cost & value: <br /><br /><blockquote>Both programs appear economically efficient, comparing favorably to thecost of hiring full-time security researchers. (pg 1)</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"> We find that VRPs appear to provide an economically efficient mechanism  for finding vulnerabilities, with a reasonable cost/benefit trade-off  (Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.6). (pg 6)</blockquote> Benefits of a bug bounty program:<br /><blockquote>VRPs offer a number of potential attractions to software vendors. Offering adequate incentives entices security researchers to look for vulnerabilities, and this increased attention improves the likelihood of finding latent vulnerabilities. </blockquote><br /><blockquote>Second, coordinating with security researchers allows vendors to more effectively manage vulnerability disclosures, reducing the likelihood of unexpected and costly zero-day disclosures. Monetary rewards provide an incentive for security researchers not to sell their research results to malicious actors in the underground economy or the gray world of vulnerability markets. </blockquote><br /><blockquote>Third, VRPs may make it more difficult for black hats to find vulnerabilities to exploit. Patching vulnerabilities found through a VRP increases the difficulty and therefore cost for malicious actors to find zero-days because the pool of latent vulnerabilities has been diminished. Additionally, experience gained from VRPs (and exploit bounties [23,28]) can yield improvements to mitigation techniques and help identify other related vulnerabilities and sources of bugs. </blockquote><blockquote>Finally, VRPs often engender goodwill amongst the community of security researchers. Taken together, VRPs provide an attractive tool for increasing product security and protecting customer.  (pg 1)</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><br /></blockquote>Lastly, I presented on bug bounty programs for websites a few years back at OWASP <a href=\"http://appsecusa.org/\">AppSecUSA</a>.

You have an idea that could benefit people, but don’t find the time to work on it. You commit yourself to working on it and getting it done, you set a day to do it, you work on it and are almost finished… when you find out someone else had the same brilliant idea as you… and uploaded a solution 2 days prior. If it’s not always the way, then its close to it, and it just happened to me.</p>
<p>Right now sitting in what is turning into a lovely summers evening here at the <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/mozilla-spaces/\">Mozilla London Space</a> I’m taking some time to reflect on the day. A day, that despite being at first glance a waste of time, has actually taught me quite a bit. Before I get into that lets quickly go over what the “Finish” is.</p>
<p>I’ve had the idea for quite a while to create an install script for <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/\">Mozilla Webmaker</a> so that people might install it locally on their computers without too much work. This way providing them with a backup plan should they be running a maker event where the internet is unreliable OR non-existent. As I was drawing close to completion of my first iteration on the installer I popped my head into <a href=\"irc://irc.mozilla.org/webmaker\">#webmaker</a> (on IRC) and found out that someone had beaten me to writing an installer. They uploaded it to <a href=\"https://github.com/Pomax/webmaker-suite\">GitHub</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>Having taken the time to have a look through <a href=\"http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/\">Pomax</a>‘s solution I have to admit that he has done a better job of it than I have, or rather, his solution is a lot tidier, and neater than mine.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 1: </strong>Even if you’ve been sitting on an idea for a while and there were no solutions you could find when committing to implementing the idea, you should always do a quick check that this is still the case before you start work.</p>
<p>So given that there is already a solution out there, one that works, one that I prefer to what I wrote today, it still has some differences in approach that I think I wouldn’t take still. Due to this I’m going to spend a little while (it won’t take too long) this evening working on a mix of the two. It won’t be at its prettiest right away, however it will check some things off my list of differing approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 2: </strong>Nothing is ever perfect, though it can be made better through remixing, tweaking, and sharing.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/michellethorne.cc/wp-content/uploads/webmaker-usb.png?resize=208%2C208\" />Finally there is one key aspect to Pomax’s approach that will cause some difficulty in migrating his nicer solution to do my bidding for my overall idea. My initial idea had one extra element that I’ve not yet shared. My install script was, once complete (so not by the end of today), to be able to create <strong>webmaker on a stick</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 3: </strong>When something new appears that’s almost exactly what you were working on… its always going to be missing something that you can add.</p>
<p>There’s one more thing I learned today. Or rather can appreciate in reflection. Though I’ve spent a day working on something I’m now, for the most part, not going to use. This series of events has given me a better understanding of how webmaker is made, how to setup the environment, and more importantly, taught me three lessons I can use later down the line.</p>

<p>I plan on finishing all my posts from now on with a question. Something that relates to either my post, or something that could help me out in the not to distant future. Today that question is:</p>

<p><strong>Thanks to our partners</strong><br />
CSOL was—and is—an incredibly exciting project with many different aspects and we were extremely pleased and honored to work on it with various fantastic people from the following organizations: <a href=\"http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The City of Chicago\">the City of Chicago</a>; <a href=\"http://www.macfound.org/programs/learning/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The MacArthur Foundation, Learning programs\">the MacArthur Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.digitalyouthnetwork.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Digital Youth Network website\">Digital Youth Network</a>; <a href=\"http://www.hivechicago.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hive Chicago\">Hive Chicago</a>; <a href=\"http://ci3.uchicago.edu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Center for Interdisciplinary Inquiry and Innovation in Sexual and Reproductive Health (Ci3) at the University of Chicago\">Ci3 at the University of Chicago</a> and <a href=\"http://m2l.indiana.edu/people/m2l-staff/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Creativity Labs at Indiana University\">The Creativity Labs at Indiana University</a>.</p>
<p>A badge system design of this size and of this effort provides immense fodder for discussion, so this first post will be a brief recap painted with broad brushstrokes of some of our experience thus far. And suffice it to say that we have learned a lot—and we still have much to learn. Over the next two weeks I’ll follow up this post with additional posts that delve into more exacting detail on the system, its development and the rationale behind it.</p>
<p>But first a peek into the larger world that contains this badge system. Our design process included and addressed: issuing organizations, funding organizations, legal conditions, multiple audience needs, political considerations, academic concerns, standards alignment, distribution requirements, access capabilities, motivational discussions, socioeconomic problems, visual representation issues, employment possibilities, and varying levels of technical expertise. Certainly, not every badge system needs to or should address this many dependencies but it’s to be expected that as the size of the badge system increases, so does its propensity to surface increasing numbers of issues.</p>
<p><strong>Learning: the primary motivation</strong><br />
Summer learning drop off is a problem that has plagued schools & students for years. The Chicago Summer of Learning was aimed squarely at this issue. Working closely with numerous issuing organizations (~100), we developed methodologies to ensure that the many disparate badges worked together as a system—both from a content standpoint as well as a visual standpoint.</p>
<p>The city chose STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) as the badge system framework. This relatively strict taxonomy helped to guide the architecture of the system by providing useful parameters for the smaller, more operationally challenged organizations new to badges while also presenting potential touch points for the larger, more established organizations offering comprehensive learning opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Beginning at the beginning</strong><br />
With such a large initiative, a significant amount of recruiting for participation preceded some of the badge system design. As previously noted, each participating organization had its own motivations and goals for their programs and subsequently for their badges as well. This made perfect sense since the composition of the system was both intentionally diverse and also serendipitously alike. Seeking to maintain this essentially organic badge ecosystem, we did not require any specific criteria in the creation of the badges. Instead we encouraged organizations to consider their basic values in relationship to STEAM and then badge along those lines.</p>
<p>To get everyone onto the same conceptual page, we, in conjunction with our partners, held several in-person sessions to talk through open badges: what they were, why the city was initiating the program, how they worked, what was expected of them, etc. After these face to face facilitated sessions Mozilla created a personalized google spreadsheet for each organization to fill in with their specific badge content (more on this in an upcoming post).</p>
<p>Even in very large badge systems individual badges deserve close reading and attention and that is precisely what we provided. Poring over each spreadsheet cell by cell, we reviewed each badge, asking questions, clarifying content and requesting revisions where we felt some alteration might improve the final badge. We followed up by email with every organization to ensure that all of the badges met organizational requirements as well as the content and metadata requirements for open badges. While the idea of badges was new to many of the participating organizations, every organization enthusiastically jumped into badge content creation.</p>
<p><strong>Different lenses</strong><br />
Each entry level badge represents one or more of the STEAM categories and focuses on learning of some sort, so perhaps the most obvious lens we used on them was learning. A final tally of the issuing organizations revealed the following three categories for learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>in-school teaching and learning organizations (formal)</li>
<li>out of school teaching and learning organizations (informal)</li>
<li>the City of Chicago organizations (governmental)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Badge pathways</strong><br />
Another lens onto this system comes from the hierarchy of badge progressions or badge pathways. We considered a number of possible badge levels and requirements before settling on a relatively straightforward progression. We arrived at a simple structure due to some significant aspects of the program: 1) the time in between school year end and school year beginning is surprisingly brief; 2) the number of opportunities to be had was wonderfully rich and we wanted participants to be able to experience as much of it as they were able to; and, 3) the technical considerations of linking a range of different systems proved quite complex in our limited timeframe. All of these factors—plus others—contributed to our decision to implement a streamlined badge system hierarchy.</p>
<p>The suggested path was as follows: earn a required number of entry level badges in any STEAM category from any organization, and when the required level is reached those badges in turn level up the earner to one of the City of Chicago awarded S-T-E-A-M badges; the earning of that city level badge in turn unlocks a series of STEAM-related citywide challenges & associated badges that can also be earned. Viewed through that lens, the system looks as follows:</p>
<p><em>Entry level badges</em></p>
<ul>
<li>organizations offering entry level badges through face to face participation</li>
<li>organizations offering badges through self-paced activities</li>
<li>Ci3 offering The Source game badges</li>
</ul>
<p><em>City level badges</em></p>
<ul>
<li>the City of Chicago offering Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math city-level badges</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Challenge badges</em></p>
<ul>
<li>organizations offering citywide challenge badges</li>
</ul>
<p>The system can be expanded outward from this framework. There were additional suggested badge pathway opportunities as well but this represents the germinal structure.</p>
<p><strong>Still more to come</strong><br />
As noted above, this was a fantastic opportunity for the Mozilla Open Badges team to test out some of our hypotheses about badge design, badge system design, and technical considerations. CSOL provided us with wonderful circumstances ripe for creativity. We were honored to work side by side with individuals profoundly committed to improving the possibilities for the youth of Chicago through open badges, and we’re excited to see new learning pathways being forged by Chicago youth.</p>
<p>Along the way we conceptualized, designed and created a number of new tools that we’ll continue to refine: some for assessment, some for badge creation, and some for badge issuing. We found it tremendously educational and informative to work directly with organizations brand new to badging, and we were deeply moved when those same organizations were impressed with their own conceptual development and badge thinking. It’s been an amazing ride and it’s not over yet.</p>
<p>Many, many thanks to the Open Badges team who brought this dream to life. Together we salute the youth of Chicago and all of the people who help them on their journeys.</p>

<p>We’ve abandoned the current disk format and use separate file for each URL however small in size it is.  Each file is using self-control hashes to check it’s correct, so no fsyncs are needed.  Everything is asynchronous or fully buffered.  There is a single background thread to do any I/O like opening, reading and writing.  On Android we are writing to the context cache directory.  This way the cached data are actually treated as that.</p>
<p>I’ve performed some first tests using http://janbambas.cz/ as a test page.  Currently as I write this post there are some 460 images.  Testing was made on a relatively fast machine, but important is to differentiate on the storage efficiency.  I had two extremes available: an SSD and an old and slow-like-hell microSD via a USB reader.</p>

<p>*) Here I’m getting unstable results.  I’m doing more testing with having more concurrent open and read threads.  It seems there is not that much effect and the jitter in time measurements is just a noise.</p>
<p>I will report on thread concurrent I/O more in a different post later since I find it quite interesting space to explore.</p>
<p>Clearly the cold “type and go” test case shows that blockfiles are beating us here.  But the big difference is that UI is completely jank free with the new back-end!</p>

<h3>Testing on an SSD disk:</h3>
<p>The results are not that different for the current and the new back-end, only a small regression in warmed and cold “go to” test cases:</p>

<p>Having multiple threads seems not to have any affect as far as precision of my measurements goes.</p>
<p>At this moment I am not sure what causes the regression for both the “go to” cases on an SSD, but I believe it’s just a question of some simple optimizations, like delivering more then just 4096 bytes per a thread loop as we do now or a fact we don’t cache redirects – it’s a known bug right now.</p>

<p>… Yes, I know, that happened a month ago. But in the meantime, as you’ll see in the following blog posts, we have all been quite busy. This report is just the first of a long series. Because this June at Mozilla, and in Paris especially, was absolutely crazy!</p>
<p>The month opened with fanfare for a well-attended event: the inauguration of Mozilla’s new Paris office.</p>
<p>And what an office! Judge for yourself:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3680/9054730095_dae56e86e6_z.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"427\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3680/9054730095_dae56e86e6_z.jpg\" title=\"Photo: mozillaeu\" width=\"640\" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, the gold leaf is impressive and might seem a departure from the spirit of Free Software. But this is not how I see things! To me, the gilded ornamentation and the immense new space signify the important Mozilla places on its employees, and above all on its community. Because this is not just an office: it is a community space. Mozilla has in fact dedicated a large part of the office space to the community. The ballroom (the most beautiful room, no less!) is designed to welcome all who wish to organize events around Mozilla and its mission, and additionally any volunteers who want to come and work hand-in-hand with employees contributing to the Mozilla project.</p>
<p>Thus, the week of the inauguration began with a Firefox OS Hackathon.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Sunday: the hackathon</strong> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>Firefox OS, as you surely know, is one of the most inspiring projects in recent years. And the fantastic thing for the French and francophone community is that an entire team is based in the Paris office: the team working on Gaia, the frontend of Firefox OS.</p>
<p>And this team pays attention to its community, as they showed during this latest hackathon, which demonstrated the endless possibilities of Firefox OS.</p>
<div id=\"magicdomid32\">Since the web is the platform, Firefox OS offers huge opportunities for all web developers. Now anyone who wants to can create their own application and list it on the marketplace. What do you need? Some creativity, some ingenuity, and knowing your audience!</div>
<div></div>
<div id=\"magicdomid35\">So the office opened its doors on Sunday at 9 AM. (I won’t deny that it was challenging for most to wake up this early, especially on a Sunday!). The event started with three presentations, which aimed at answering as many questions as possible and making attendees comfortable with the tools:</div>
<p>- Anthony Ricaud, who belongs to the Gaia team, introduced how an app works on the technical side. In other words, what are the prerequisites before you get started developing one.</p>
<div id=\"magicdomid41\">- Jérémie Patonnier, valued contributer and documentation specialist, showed where all the information about Firefox OS, the documentation, and tutorials can be found.</div>
<p>- Finally, Antoine (aka GeekShadow) showed us how to publish an app on the marketplace.</p>
<p>Regarding this, I would like to sincerely thank Jérémie and Antoine for their availibility. We were short of presenters in the office for the marketplace conference, and Antoine being the excellent contributor he is, offered to come all the way from Saint-Nazaire. His presentation was flawless. Not really suprising given that Antoine knows his stuff since he already published applucations. Based on this experience, he stayed the whole day and shared with the hackathon attendees. Same thing about Jérémie, becoming more and more unavoidable in the community: he doesn’t keep count on contributed hours and always comes up with the best advice. His thorough knowledge about documentation is worth a lot to us.</p>
<div id=\"magicdomid50\">But Anthony, Antoine, and Jérémie weren’t the only ones to be here for the event. Ben Francis (Gaia Developer living in England), Vivien (Gaia Tech Lead), Yoric (Mr. Mozilla Education in the Paris Office), David Scravaglieri (Firefox OS manager in Europe), Adrian, Mat’, Nical, Padenot, and Pascal were all there to help the attendees. Dressed as the Smurfs (due to their blue Firefox OS tee-shirt), they spent their day answering the questions of some 50 developers.</div>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5346/8994914880_b02f7243ae_z.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5346/8994914880_b02f7243ae_z.jpg\" title=\"Some of our \"Smurfs\": Antoine, Vivien and Ben\" width=\"640\" /></a></p>
<div id=\"magicdomid53\">The success of this hackathon is most certainly due to their availability. In the end, no less than 24 applications were created! And in a limited period of time (roughly 7 hours) with, let’s be honest, big Wi-Fi issues (which was the negative point of this day).</div>
<div></div>
<div id=\"magicdomid56\">24 applications and 6 winners elected by our brilliant jury consisting of David Scravaglieri, Vivien Nicolas, Jérémie Patonnier (both a talented developer and a design expert), Adrian Gaudebert (our resident game specialist), plus Brad Fuellenbach and Mathew Caldwell from Mozilla HR. No less! They voted upon three criteria: originality, responsiveness, and design.</div>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/9003558299_be3a2c1bf9_z.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/9003558299_be3a2c1bf9_z.jpg\" title=\"The winner and the President of our jury\" width=\"480\" /></a></p>
<p>This hackathon of course was only the first of a series of events about Mozilla products. Do not hesitate to tell us which product you would like to be covered!</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7458/9003554341_95971f2539_z.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7458/9003554341_95971f2539_z.jpg\" title=\"Pong Arena, a game proposed by Dreamirl\" width=\"640\" /></a></p>
<div id=\"magicdomid62\">I would like to thank all the attendees for their seriousness (we could have heard a pin drop), but also for their joy and their talent. I would like to thank our Smurfs for the time they spent, showing how great our community is, especially Yoric, who gave a lot in this event by contacting schools and students.</div>
<div></div>
<div id=\"magicdomid65\">Finally, a big thank you to the organisers: Amié Tyrrel and Kimber who helped from the USA. Thank you Shannon Clayton and Clara Carle, our Parisian office hosts and good fairies. You will soon figure out that they kept on rocking the following days.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Tuesday: the Community</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<div id=\"magicdomid71\">The hackathon was just an introduction to an entire week, dedicated to the opening of this highly-anticipated office. Why a week? Simply because even so large a space could not accomodate more than a hundred or so people at a time. And Mozilla has many more friends than that!</div>
<p>So it was decided to split the inauguration parties in order to welcome as many people as possible. And to meet everyone’s expectations. I had the fortune ot partipate in all of the parties and thus offer you a little summary (now that the effects of the champagne I drank each night have evaporated).</p>
<p>Tuesday’s soiree was the one closest to my own heart: one dedicated to the Community. Amié created an Eventbrite page, and opened it to everyone who wanted to contribute, and of course those who already do. They are many!</p>
<p>So we were like one big family that Tuesday. A beautiful family, joined by the bonds of Free Software and love for Mozilla. A familly welcomed of course by Tristan Nitot (who else?) who in a speech recounted the path that Mozilla Paris has traveled, starting in his garage and ending up in this office today.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7355/9054883387_79f103b977_z.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"427\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7355/9054883387_79f103b977_z.jpg\" title=\"During Tristan's talk\" width=\"640\" /></a></p>
<div id=\"magicdomid83\">For the occasion, Mozilla had berets made for the guests. (\"Béret\" is also the name of one of the rooms in the new office. It is adjacent to \"Marcel,\" and farther away are \"Baguette,\" \"Saucisson,\" and \"Ouh La La.\" You see, the employees from the Paris office have their sense of humor!) The beret looked marvelous on our dear Tristan!</div>
<p><a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7431/9054882483_1f4849bfc1_z.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"427\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7431/9054882483_1f4849bfc1_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></p>
<p>For the occasion, and for the entire week, I dressed myself in an outfit worthy of a meringue. Orange, with a blue shawl, and an awesome handbag with a fox’s head. Honestly, what wouldn’t I do for Mozilla?!!</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7418/9057086100_a257d3cf0d_z.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7418/9057086100_a257d3cf0d_z.jpg\" width=\"427\" /></a></p>
<p>It was in this outfit that I gave my speech on the Community. This Community that I love so, and that makes me feel so great. I’ll put the text of the speech in a blog post to follow, since several people have asked me for it.</p>
<p>And because the Community is curious about the latest news. Because there are always many questions and the employees are often overloaded, they took this opportunity to present the latest projects developed by Mozilla:</p>
<p>- Firefox OS, of course, was presented by David Scravaglieri, who then answered the avalanche of questions with good humor. This gave rise to some flavorful exchanges.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3682/9057105594_69d76d1cac_z.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"427\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3682/9057105594_69d76d1cac_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></p>
<p>- WebRTC was presented by Jean-Baptiste Piacentino, who gave a little demonstration with the help of Florian Quèze.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5332/9054878101_98f7260372_z.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"427\" src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5332/9054878101_98f7260372_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></p>
<p><a href=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5546/9057102668_bc7764eafd_z.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"427\" src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5546/9057102668_bc7764eafd_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></p>
<p>- Lastly, Webmaker was given an extremely comprehensive presentation by our brilliant Clochix, a contributor who is enthusiastic about issues of education, and who knows Webmaker like the back of his hand. We thank him again for making himself available and for sporting the beret!</p>
<p>Next? Well, there were toasts offered again and again in honor of Mozilla, ardent conversations, happy faces, hugs. The Community’s pleasure at discovering this space which Mozilla has made available to them. And already some ideas for more Free Software events.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Wednesday: Mozilla’s Economic Role<br />
</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On Wednesday the festivities continued around a new theme. At Tristan’s excellent suggestion, Mozilla invited various participants in Free Software and the internet industry. But also from the schools who are training the future participants in the digital economy.</p>
<p>Why? Because Mozilla was eager to assure them that these tools are at their disposal. That Free Software is not a utopia. That partnerships are possible. That Mozilla will always be there to carry the torch of Free Software and help with its development.</p>
<p>With Firefox OS, Mozilla has started building partnerships with industry giants like Telefónica and Deutsche Telekom. But Mozilla’s DNA remains intact. This was also the message that Tristan Nitot wanted to send to our friends in the Free Software world.</p>
<p>This was a very informative evening, driven by a number of question. And one certainty: Free Software has a bright future ahead.</p>
<p>And don’t forget: <a href=\"http://careers.mozilla.org/fr/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla recrute \">Mozilla is hiring</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Thursday: VIP party<br />
</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With such an office, Mozilla wanted to pull out all the stops, and to show that Google and company are not the only important internet players in France. Because Mozilla is here!</p>
<p>Mozilla is still growing in France, hiring new employees, making more resources available to the Community. This evening’s soiree was intended to put that on display.</p>
<p>An evening for which everyone dressed in their Sunday best. And for that alone, beleive me, it was worth it! How lovely to see all these geeks dressed in jackets, suits, and for the bravest, even dress shoes! I was delighted.</p>
<div id=\"magicdomid138\">Representing Mozilla were, of couse, Tristan Nitot, but also Debbie Cohen and Mitchell Baker! Together they welcomed our special guest: Fleur Pellerin, French Minister for the Digital Economy, who honored us with a speech in which she showed fairly good knowledge of Free Software. But most importantly, by her presence, she demonstrated her recognition of Free Software’s importance. The fact that she was present at this event is a powerful symbol.</div>
<p><a href=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3753/9040487670_63006740d7_z.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"427\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3753/9040487670_63006740d7_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></p>
<p>Fleur Pellerin was even available for a bit of cake-cutting alongside Mitchell Baker (who also treated us to a speech with her characteristic confidence).</p>
<p><a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7370/9040485896_52d16f1492_z.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"427\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7370/9040485896_52d16f1492_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></p>
<div id=\"magicdomid145\">As you can see, this week was packed, not just with champagne and petits fours, but also with chance encounters, budding plans, fruitful discussions, and messages of hope for Mozilla’s future, and for Free Software in general. Personally, I hope that the Community clearly saw that this space is now ours. And that we will be able to do beautiful things there.</div>
<p>I’d like to thank Tristan Nitot for the inception of Mozilla Europe, and for his continuing strong guidance of Mozilla France. He is the one who made this Mozilla Paris space possible by welcoming the first European Mozilla employees into his garage. And believing in it for all these years. And enabling the hiring of new employees. And making himself available to the Community.</p>
<p>Thank you to Pascal, Filip, Cédric, Goofy, Laurent, Benoît, Kazé, Frédéric, Flore, Bobo, and Paul Rouget: they created the francophone community and they continue ot be there for it after all these years.</p>
<div id=\"magicdomid154\">And big thanks also to the Gaia team in Paris: it is a great pool of talents, and a beacon for the French-speaking Community.</div>
<p>Thanks again to Amié, Kimber, Shannon, and Clara: they worked organizational miracles, and in such a short time!</p>
<p>And finally, thank you to Debbie Cohen and Mitchell: by their presence and their involvement, they once again broadened the field of possibilities.</p>
<p>So the office has now officially opened its doors. We wish it a long and happy life!</p>

CSOL was (and is) an incredibly exciting project with many different aspects and we were extremely pleased and honored to work on it with various fantastic people from the following organizations: <a href=\"http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The City of Chicago\">the City of Chicago</a>; <a href=\"http://www.macfound.org/programs/learning/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The MacArthur Foundation, Learning programs\">the MacArthur Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.digitalyouthnetwork.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Digital Youth Network website\">Digital Youth Network</a>; <a href=\"http://www.hivechicago.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hive Chicago\">Hive Chicago</a>; <a href=\"http://ci3.uchicago.edu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Center for Interdisciplinary Inquiry and Innovation in Sexual and Reproductive Health (Ci3) at the University of Chicago\">Ci3 at the University of Chicago</a> and <a href=\"http://m2l.indiana.edu/people/m2l-staff/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Creativity Labs at Indiana University\">The Creativity Labs at Indiana University</a>.</p>
<p>A badge system design of this size and of this effort provides immense fodder for discussion, so this first post will be a brief recap painted with broad brushstrokes of some of our experience thus far. And suffice it to say that we have learned a lot—and we still have much to learn. Over the next two weeks I’ll follow up this post with additional posts that delve into more exacting detail on the system, its development and the rationale behind it.</p>
<p>Our badge system design process included and addressed: issuing organizations, funding organizations, legal conditions, multiple audience needs, political considerations, academic concerns, standards alignment, distribution requirements, access capabilities, motivational discussions, socioeconomic problems, visual representation issues, employment possibilities, and varying levels of technical expertise. Certainly, not every badge system needs to or should address this many dependencies but it’s to be expected that as the size of the badge system increases, so does its propensity to surface increasing numbers of issues.</p>
<p><strong>Learning: the primary motivation</strong><br />
Summer learning drop off is a problem that has plagued schools & students for years. The Chicago Summer of Learning was aimed squarely at this issue. Working closely with numerous issuing organizations (~100), we developed methodologies to ensure that the many disparate badges worked together as a system—both from a content standpoint as well as a visual standpoint.</p>
<p>The city chose STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) as the badge system framework. This relatively strict taxonomy helped to guide the architecture of the system by providing useful parameters for the smaller, more operationally challenged organizations new to badges while also presenting potential touch points for the larger, more established organizations offering comprehensive learning opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Beginning at the beginning</strong><br />
With such a large initiative, a significant amount of recruiting for participation preceded some of the badge system design. As previously noted, each participating organization had its own motivations and goals for their programs and subsequently for their badges as well. This made perfect sense since the composition of the system was both intentionally diverse and also serendipitously alike. Seeking to maintain this essentially organic badge ecosystem, we did not require any specific criteria in the creation of the badges. Instead we encouraged organizations to consider their basic values in relationship to STEAM and then badge along those lines.</p>
<p>To get everyone onto the same conceptual page, we, in conjunction with our partners, held several in-person sessions to talk through open badges: what they were, why the city was initiating the program, how they worked, what was expected of them, etc. After these face to face facilitated sessions Mozilla provided each organization with a personalized google spreadsheet to complete (more on this in an upcoming post).</p>
<p>Even in very large badge systems individual badges deserve close reading and attention and that is precisely what we provided. Poring over each spreadsheet cell by cell, we reviewed each badge, asking questions, clarifying content and requesting revisions where we felt some alteration might improve the final badge. We followed up by email with every organization to ensure that all of the badges met organizational requirements as well as the content and metadata requirements for open badges. While the idea of badges was new to many of the participating organizations, every organization enthusiastically jumped into badge content creation.</p>
<p><strong>Different lenses</strong><br />
Each entry level badge represents one or more of the STEAM categories and focuses on learning of some sort, so perhaps the most obvious lens we used on them was learning. A final tally of the issuing organizations revealed the following three categories for learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>in-school teaching and learning organizations (formal)</li>
<li>out of school teaching and learning organizations (informal)</li>
<li>the City of Chicago organizations (governmental)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Badge pathways</strong><br />
Another lens onto this system comes from the hierarchy of badge progressions or badge pathways. We considered a number of possible badge levels and requirements before settling on a relatively straightforward progression. We arrived at a simple structure due to some significant aspects of the program: 1) the time in between school year end and school year beginning is surprisingly brief; 2) the number of opportunities to be had was wonderfully rich and we wanted participants to be able to experience as much of it as they were able, and 3) the technical considerations of linking a range of different systems proved quite complex in our limited timeframe. All of these factors—plus others—contributed to a streamlined badge system hierarchy.</p>
<p>The suggested path was as follows: earn a required number of entry level badges in any STEAM category from any organization, and when the required level is reached those badges in turn level up the earner to one of the City of Chicago awarded S-T-E-A-M badges; the earning of that city level badge in turn unlocks a series of STEAM-related citywide challenges & associated badges that can also be earned. Viewed through that lens, the system looks as follows:</p>
<p><em>Entry level badges</em></p>
<ul>
<li>organizations offering entry level badges through face to face participation</li>
<li>organizations offering badges through self-paced activities</li>
<li>Ci3 offering The Source game badges</li>
</ul>
<p><em>City level badges</em></p>
<ul>
<li>the City of Chicago offering Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math city-level badges</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Challenge badges</em></p>
<ul>
<li>organizations offering citywide challenge badges</li>
</ul>
<p>The system can be expanded outward from this framework. There were additional suggested badge pathway opportunities as well but this represents the germinal structure.</p>
<p><strong>Still more to come</strong><br />
As noted above, this was a fantastic opportunity for the Mozilla Open Badges team to test out some of our hypotheses about badge design, badge system design, and technical considerations. CSOL provided us with wonderful circumstances ripe for creativity. We were honored to work side by side with individuals profoundly committed to improving the possibilities for the youth of Chicago through open badges. And we’re excited to see the badge pathways being forged by the Chicago youth.</p>
<p>Along the way we conceptualized, designed and created a number of new tools that we’ll continue to refine: some for assessment, some for badge creation, and some for badge issuing. We found it tremendously educational and informative to work directly with organizations brand new to badging; and we were deeply moved when those same organizations were impressed with their own conceptual development and badge thinking. It’s been an amazing ride and it’s not over yet.</p>
<p>Many, many thanks to the Open Badges team who brought this dream to life. Together we salute the youth of Chicago and all of the people who help them on their journeys.</p>

<h3>Image Handling</h3>
<p>Back in March <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2013/03/07/memshrink-progress-week-89-90/\">I described how Timothy Nikkel had greatly improved Firefox’s handling of image-heavy pages</a>.  Unfortunately, the fix had to be disabled in Firefox 22 and Firefox 23 because it caused jerky scrolling on pages with lots of small images, such as Pinterest.</p>
<p>Happily, Timothy <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=845147\">has now fixed those problems</a>, and so his previous change has been re-enabled in Firefox 24.  This takes a big chunk out of the #1 item on the <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2013/06/15/memshrinks-2nd-birthday/\">MemShrink big ticket items list</a>.  Fantastic news!</p>
<h3>Lazy Bytecode Generation</h3>
<p>Brian Hackett finished implementing <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678037\">lazy bytecode generation</a>.  This change means that JavaScript functions don’t have bytecode generated for them until they run.  Because lots of websites use libraries like jQuery, in practice a lot of JS functions are never run, and we’ve found this can reduce Firefox’s memory consumption by 5% or more on common workloads!  That’s a huge, general improvement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it significantly reduces the number of things that are allocated on the GC heap (i.e. scripts, strings, objects and shapes that are created when bytecode for a function is generated).  This reduces pressure on the GC which makes it less likely we’ll have bad GC behaviour (e.g. pauses, or too much memory consumption) in cases where the GC heuristics aren’t optimal.</p>
<p>The completion of this finished off item #5 on the <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2012/07/11/memshrink-progress-week-55-56/\">old Memshrink big ticket items list</a>.  Great stuff.  This will be in Firefox 24.</p>
<h3>Add-on Memory Reporting</h3>
<p>Nils Maier <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=846019\">implemented add-on memory reporting in about:memory</a>.  Here’s some example output from my current session.</p>
<pre>├───33,345,136 B (05.08%) -- add-ons
│   ├──18,818,336 B (02.87%) ++ {d10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d}
│   ├──11,830,424 B (01.80%) ++ {59c81df5-4b7a-477b-912d-4e0fdf64e5f2}
│   └───2,696,376 B (00.41%) ++ treestyletab@piro.sakura.ne.jp/js-non-window/zones/zone(0x7fbd7bf53800)</pre>
<p>It’s obvious that Tree Style Tabs is taking up 2.7 MB.  What about the other two entries?  It’s not immediately obvious, but if I look in about:support at the “extensions” section I can see that they are AdBlock Plus and ChatZilla.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why those add-ons are reported as hex strings, it’s due to a combination of the packaging of each individual add-on, and the fact that the memory reporting code is C++ and the add-on identification code is JS and there aren’t yet good APIs to communicate between the two.  (Yes, it’s not ideal and should be improved, but it’s a good start.)  Also, not all add-on memory is reported, just that in JS compartments;  old-style XUL add-ons in particular can have their memory consumption under-reported.</p>
<p>Despite the shortcomings, this is a big deal.  Users have been asking for this information for <em>years</em>, and we’ve finally got it.  (Admittedly, the fact that we’ve tamed add-on leaks makes it less important than it used to be, but it’s still cool.)  This will also be in Firefox 24.</p>
<h3>b2g</h3>
<p>Gregor Wagner has landed a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=850175\">nice</a> <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=887652\">collection</a> of patches to help the Twitter and Notes+ apps on B2G.</p>
<p>While on the topic of B2G, in today’s MemShrink meeting we discussed the ongoing problem of slow memory leaks in the main B2G process.  Such leaks can cause the phone to crash or become flaky after its been running for hours or days or weeks, and they’re really painful to reproduce and diagnose.  Our partners are finding these leaks when doing multi-hour stress tests as part of their QA processes.  In contrast, Mozilla doesn’t really have any such testing, and as a result we are reacting, flat-footed, to external reports, rather than catching them early ourselves.  This is a big problem because users will rightly expect to have their phones run for weeks (or even months) without rebooting.</p>
<p>Those of us present at the meeting weren’t quite sure how we can improve our QA situation to look for these leaks.  I’d be interested to hear any suggestions.  Thanks!</p>" nil nil "9766edf919da6cc60ee8952d9f8a90bd") (314 (20957 6053 910054) "http://satdavuk.wordpress.com/2013/07/09/july-10th-mobile-and-b2g-call-at-1030am-pt/" "David W: July 10th mobile and b2g call at 10:30am pt" "satdavuk" "Tue, 09 Jul 2013 23:47:18 +0000" "<p>We are doing a meeting live on air.mozilla July 10th at 10:30am to view the meeting we will be live on Air Mozilla </p>

<p>Sometime while waiting for the 4am shows to start my husband and I wandered through the vendor stalls.  It was odd — other than food, drink and a huge number of cigarettes (it is still very surprising to me, still a Californian at heart, to see how much smoking is a part of daily life here), the only item for purchase were all small print runs of posters, mostly band and venue posters.  It was fun to see: there were no mass produced items, and so we saw the return of serious, low-volume speciality printing.</p>
<p>One set of prints caught our eye — it was a set of eyes, not a musical print but interesting.  Here they are:<a href=\"https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/eyes.jpg\"><img alt=\"eyes\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3649\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/eyes-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" /></a> For those of you who are familiar with Terri Prachett’s “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_You_Can_Save_Mankind\">Only You Can Save Mankind</a>“ these remind me of the captain, although her color palate is different.</p>
<p>We ended up in an instant, totally comfortable conversation with the proprietor of this stall.   As we talk I am repeatedly drawn to a particular poster, very ornate, for some reason I couldn’t quite place. Here’s what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href=\"https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/JohnHoward.png\"><img alt=\"JohnHoward\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3652\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/JohnHoward-233x300.png\" width=\"233\" /></a></p>
<p>After a while we learn the proprietor of the stall is from Berkeley, CA.    That explains it — I was born in Berkeley, grew up in the town next door, went to college and grad  school in Berkeley, understand the vibe and often like the people.</p>
<p>Eventually it’s time for our show to start and so he, his wife, my husband and I say our “we’ll-come-by-and-visit-you-once-we-move-back-to-California” good-buys. We get along so well he pulls out his good, special business card.  Immediately I see it says “monkey.”    I say “there’s a lot of monkeys in the world.”</p>
<p>He responds “Yes, I made a JaegerMonkey t-shirt for Mozilla a while back.”  My husband and I stop, stunned.  Our son wears his JaegerMonkey t-shirt regularly  (actually, it started off as my t-shirt but we both realized  immediately it would become his.) There is JaegerMonkey inspired artwork, album covers and even music floating around our house, thanks to the kids  who have been drawn to the JaegerMonkey t-shirt.  On a recent trip to the coast one of my son’s friends spent the trip making an 8-bit, mine-craft like JaegerMonkey image ….</p>
<p>My husband points to the small Firefox button he has pinned to his jacket and describes my role.  The print-maker shows off the t-shirt he’s wearing, which is the test print for the new Mozilla shirt he’s driving down to our offices when he gets back to California.  We all stand around stunned for a bit.  I don’t  have the new Mozilla t-shirt, but thanks to this odd meeting we’ve not the copies of the prints above.  You can find the prints at the <a href=\"http://www.monkeyink.com/ink/\">monkeyink</a> website.</p>" nil nil "66faa877e7685fd08e8fdeebc51ff47b") (310 (20957 6053 906273) "http://michael.bebenita.com/imported-20100930232226/2013/7/9/latest-shumway-demos.html" "Michael Bebenita: Latest Shumway Demos" "Michael Bebenita" "Tue, 09 Jul 2013 18:32:38 +0000" "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shumway is a Flash player and runtime written entirely in JavaScript.

<li>Racing Game: A very simple ActionScript 3 racing game, most notable feature here is path hit testing which is used by the game to implement collision detection.</li>
<li>Box2D Demo 1: A demo of the Box 2D physics engine ported to ActionScript3. Shumway uses a JIT compiler to translate ActionScript 3 (bytecode) to JavaScript. You will notice a slight pause right before the first box lands on the floor, this is the Shumway JIT compiling the Box 2D code required to compute collision response.</li>
<li>Box2D Demo 2: A few more complicated Box 2D scenes. There is a sight delay at startup while the JIT compiles the code, but then the simulations are fairly smooth.</li>
<li>Box2D Truck Demo: Same as above.</li>
<li>Truck Game: This is a fairly complex Flash game that uses Box2D internally and has a lot of graphic assets. The short stutter at the beginning is because of a very large SVG shape that is displayed briefly, it however takes a long time to parse and render. During the loading screen (right before the game starts) the game renders all of its vector graphic assets into bitmaps which are then composited during the game. The game itself is definitely playable.  </li>

<p>*) Here I’m getting unstable results.  I’m doing more testing with having more concurrent open and read threads.  It seems there is not that much effect and the jitter in time measurements is just a noise.</p>
<p>I will report on thread concurrent I/O more in a different post later since I find it quite interesting space to explore.</p>
<p>Clearly the cold “type and go” test case shows that blockfiles are beating us here.  But the big difference is that UI is completely jank free with the new back-end!</p>

Yes, you can rehearse the one talk to rule them all and repeatedly deliver it but I promise it will be much more rewarding to you and your audiences to mix it up and do different things for different audiences. <img alt=\"the terror of speaking to a room\" src=\"http://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/terror-speaking-to-a-room.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>Watching your own work is painful but excellent if you want to get better. You can be very critical about yourself without being hurtful – as others would be if they said the same things you say in your head. When watching some of my talks I found a few traps I fall into that I want to avoid in the future to get better. And here I listed five of them that a lot of speakers fall into without knowing the effects this may have on the talk overall and the audience.</p>
<p></p><h3>The “little bit extra” trap</h3><p></p>
<p><a href=\"http://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/transformers-story-structure.jpg\"><img alt=\"transformers story structure\" src=\"http://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/transformers-story-structure-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></a>I fall for this a lot (and I can point it out in some of my talks and cringe when I see the videos): you’ve written a nice talk, with a good <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_structure\">narrative structure</a> and then you remember that one other thing that is funny, interesting, or current and you add it in and make it somehow work. In my case I do that a lot off the cuff on stage. This is actually for you, and not for the audience. For them it might be a quick “ha-ha” or “ah-hah!” moment but all in all distracts from the overall message. Whenever you feel the need to add yet another thing that might need some persuasion to fit in the overall picture, don’t. Instead re-evaluate what you have, maybe change the order of your examples a bit, and pace yourself more on stage.</p>
<p>Three things, delivered with conviction and passion and explained well are better than ten things for the audience to pick and mix. More likely they’ll have forgotten the second one by the time you reach the seventh.</p>
<p></p><h3>The “let me tell you about myself” trap</h3><p></p>
<p>Introducing yourself is important, both in “real life” communication and on stage. You should however consider the context. At an unconference, where nobody knows who speaks where and when, having a slide telling people who you are and how to contact you is incredibly important and a good start for a career as a presenter. At a conference and when you are already known, less so. First of all, every conference has a speaker bio on the conference page and in the printouts attendees get. If really nobody reads them, why do we bother adding them? Secondly, most conferences will have an MC who introduces speakers and talks about housekeeping and such. Talk to the MC instead to introduce you properly and you can skip the “here’s me, here’s where I work, here’s where I am from, here is what I did in the past” and use the short time you have on stage for something the audience benefits from right now instead.</p>
<p></p><h3>The “I must show, not explain!” trap</h3><p></p>
<p>This is a tricky one, as – especially in the tech world – live demos are very successful with audiences and people are incredibly excited to see people they look up do showing live coding magic on stage. If that is what you want to do, also be aware that at this moment you are not speaking at a conference. Instead you are performing.</p>
<p>This can be done amazingly well – Seb Lee-Delisle being someone who immediately springs to mind. But it can also go horribly wrong, where you see someone spending most of their talk covering “waiting for wireless to connect” or “I need to start the server” or “oh, that crashed, let’s try that again!”. Yes, live demos are amazingly impressive, but we should also question how much more than just a show they are for the audience. How much will be repeatable? Probably not much. There is nothing wrong with showing a screencast of a perfectly working example and narrate over it. There is also nothing wrong about explaining the “why” instead of the “how” from time to time. You are a speaker, not necessarily a performer.</p>
<p>It is very strange, actually. A lot of people will say they love speakers do live coding, as that means they are not sales guys just promising things. On the other hand I have seen far too many “product walkthroughs” that looked liked live code, but have been scripted and in some cases even simulated. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief\">Suspension of Disbelief</a> works in movies and on stage – any stage.</p>
<p></p><h3>The “just look at this video with me” trap</h3><p></p>
<p>Videos are cool, and a very simple way to convey a lot of information in a very short amount of time. They achieve that by being very demanding to the person watching them – all your senses (except for touch, but <a href=\"http://s2013.siggraph.org/attendees/emerging-technologies/events/aireal-tactile-gaming-experiences-free-air\">we are working on that</a>) are catered to. This also means that showing a video with sound on will steal the audience from you. You become a spectator with them and it needs quite some skill to reel them back in. Think about that. Starting or ending with a video is easier and less of a disruption but seeing that video can always be an issue with external projectors, you might just want to give it a miss and show a screenshot of the video instead with its <span class=\"caps\">URL</span> and tell people to watch it in their own time.</p>
<p></p><h3>The “code, code, glorious code” trap</h3><p></p>
<p><img alt=\"sleep sheep\" src=\"http://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sleep-sheep.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />Showing code on stage makes it a much more technical talk than not showing code. But showing unreadable code or overwhelming people with it doesn’t make it technical talk – it makes it an exercise in frustration. Try to keep your code examples short and sweet. In contrast to articles where completeness of code samples is incredibly important – as people copy and paste them verbatim –  nobody is going to copy your codes from the slides. It is a bit of technical info and needs your narration to make it understandable.</p>
<p>Five or six lines should be enough – make sure to use colour coding and have a nice, big, readable font. Line numbers are also very useful (even when it is only five lines). A cute little idea when just explaining that code is what you cover right now is to use <a href=\"http://instacod.es/\">instacode</a> which gives you Instagram style filtered screenshots of code.</p>

<p>For this reason, I was thrilled to be invited to speak at FISL this year. I gave two talks—both in Portuguese. The first one was called <em>Reflections on a Career in Open Source</em> (<a href=\"http://hemingway.softwarelivre.org/fisl14/high/41b/sala41b-high-201307041801.ogg\">video</a>, 83.3MB, CC-BY-SA) and the second one was called <em>Firefox for Android: Past, Present, and Future</em> (<a href=\"http://hemingway.softwarelivre.org/fisl14/high/41b/sala41b-high-201307051102.ogg\">video</a>, 69.5MB, CC-BY-SA).</p>
<p>This was also a great opportunity to meet a lot of people from the Mozilla community in Brazil. Mozilla had a solid presence at the conference because of their hard work. Besides all the talks covering different Mozilla initiatives, there was a Firefox OS apps hackathon and a few SUMO sprints—both had pretty good attendance.</p>
<p>Attending FISL this year has been a rather nostalgic experience. Just crossing the main entrance brought up some vivid memories from my first FISLs. A lot has changed in the conference: new faces, new projects, larger audience, etc. But the atmosphere is still the same: thousands of people sharing their passion for software freedom.</p>

The penguins should start dancing together, the watermelon should explode the moment the blind-folded person hits it, the credits should roll after the movie finishes and so on.</p>
<p>In this post I want to outline the approach taken to these problems in <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/\">Web Animations</a> and the biggest new feature in the spec: <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/#grouping-and-synchronization\">timing groups</a>. But first, what can we already do?</p>
<h3>Synchronization in CSS</h3>
<p>In CSS you can do a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>By toggling a style on a common ancestor you can get two animations to start at the same time. For example, see <a href=\"http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/14/the-guide-to-css-animation-principles-and-examples/\">this example from Smashing Magazine</a>.
</li><li>Using <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/#animation-delay-property\">animation-delay</a> you can stagger the start times of animations and by calculating the length of A, you can use this to make B start after A.
</li></ul>
<p>There are a few limitations though:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s not particularly scalable</strong>—if A changes duration, you need to update B as well. That’s particularly problematic if, for example, A is a video of unknown length.
</li><li>You’re not declaring the temporal relationships between different animations—their synchronization is just a by-product of how you triggered them—and as a result <strong>there’s no easy way to pause or seek a particular set of animations</strong>.
</li><li>It requires you to structure your document so that you’ve got a common ancestor to toggle a class on. Suddenly <strong>your document structure is doing triple duty</strong>: semantics, layout (all those empty <div>s to persuade CSS to do what you want), and timing.
</li><li>You <strong>can’t create animations on the fly that line up</strong> with already running animations.
</li></ul>
<h3>The problem with SVG and syncbase timing</h3>
<p>SVG has a neat feature which seems to meet these needs: syncbase timing. That lets you create arrangements like:</p>
<div style=\"margin-left: 3em; text-align: left;\"><code>  <animate id=\"a\" begin=\"b.end\" ... /><br />
<animate id=\"b\" begin=\"0s\" end=\"c.end\" ... /><br />
<animate id=\"c\" begin=\"a.begin+2s\" ... /></code></div>
<p>That would seem to do everything we could ever want, except it has a few problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s complex.</strong> The above example is just the tip of the iceberg. You can have <em>any</em> number of conditions on both the begin and end of an animation pointing to <em>any</em> other animation including the same animation. You can create cyclic dependencies and some are allowed, some are not, and the rules for breaking cycles are vague (and thus, inconsistently implemented).
<p> What’s more, all this feeds in to the most complex part of SVG animation: deciding what intervals to create. As a result if you want to determine what animations are active at a given time, you have to step through all the significant moments up to that time and work out what intervals to create. This makes seeking costly.</p>
</li><li>Another problem is that <strong>you can’t cancel just part of such a sequence.</strong>
<p> For example, imagine you have a sequence of actions A, B, and C representing “fade the background of the button from grey to blue”, “pulse it”, then “make it glow”. You trigger A when the mouse moves over the button but the mouse suddenly leaves while A is still running. You cancel A (e.g. using <code>end=\"mouseout\"</code> or <code>endElement</code>) but then B still runs since it sees that A has ended. And consequently C also runs. There’s no way to cancel the chain and nor is there any way to seek/pause such a chain independently of other animations that might be running.
</p></li></ul>
<h3>Enter timing groups</h3>
<p>These use cases can be addressed using the concept of timing groups. This is a well-established concept in animation APIs. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qdeclarativeanimation.html\">QML</a> has <code>ParallelAnimation</code>s and <code>SequenceAnimation</code>s.
</li><li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL/smil-timing.html#q52\">SMIL</a> has <code><par></code>, <code><seq></code>, and <code><excl></code> time containers.
</li><li><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/AnimatorSet.html\">Android</a> has <code>AnimatorSet</code>s that play animations together or in sequence.
</li></ul>
<p>Common to all these APIs is the concept of two types of groups: <strong>groups that run animations together</strong> and <strong>groups that run animations in sequence</strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in each of these APIs the two types of <strong>groups can be nested</strong> so you can easily build complex arrangements up from simple parts in a way that is easy to reason about.</p>
<p>For example, the following arrangement:</p>
<div style=\"margin-left: 3em; text-align: left; font-size: 1.1em;\"><code>
<pre><animate id=\"curtainOpens\" ... />
<animate id=\"penguinADances\" begin=\"curtainOpens.end\" ... />
<animate id=\"penguinBDances\" begin=\"curtainOpens.end\" ... />
<animate id=\"curtainCloses\" begin=\"penguinBDances.end\" ... /></pre>
</code><p><code></code></p></div>
<p>could be represented with timing groups as:</p>
<div style=\"margin-left: 3em; text-align: left; font-size: 1.1em;\"><code>
<pre><seq>
<animate id=\"curtainOpens\" ... />
<par>
<animate id=\"penguinADances\" ... />
<animate id=\"penguinBDances\" ... />
</par>
<animate id=\"curtainCloses\" ... />
</seq></pre>
</code><p><code></code></p></div>
<p>Graphically, the arrangement is as follows:</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/group-example-3.png\"><img alt=\"A sequence timing group that contains a parallel timing group as a child. The parallel timing group waits for the previous child of the sequence timing group to finish, and then the children of the parallel timing group play simultaneously. After they have finished the next child of the sequence timing group plays.\" height=\"317\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/group-example-3.png\" title=\"Nested timing group example\" width=\"500\" /></a></div>
<p>You can cancel a chain of animations in this case by simply cancelling the group. The hierarchical nature of the groups also means seeking is constant-time with regards to the seek interval.</p>
<h3>Timing groups in Web Animations</h3>
<p>In <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/\">Web Animations</a> we have adopted this same approach of using timing groups with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two types of timing groups: <strong>parallel, sequence</strong>.
</li><li><strong>Children of a group can have a delay which can also be negative</strong>. This allows children of a sequence group to overlap so you can, for example, start a fade animation 2s before a video ends. (SMIL does not allow negative delays on children of a sequence group.)
</li><li>Any timing property you can apply to an animation, you can also apply to a group which means <strong>you can repeat, ease, reverse, delay, or speed up a group</strong>.
</li></ul>
<p>The last point is interesting since most other APIs don’t do that. It can be quite useful as we showed in a demo of this in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvNQNtIfXXI\">our preview video last October</a> where we combined a door closing animation and a creaking sound “animation” in a group then eased the group.</p>
<p>However, it introduces some complexity. For example, since easing functions can be non-invertible, it means you can’t always convert from child time to group time which complicates event handling.</p>
<p>Also, the interaction between <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/#fill-behavior\">fill modes</a> specified on a group and on a child are not always obvious and we need to revise the spec to be more intuitive in this area.</p>
<p>Building up the example above using the API in Web Animations look like the following.</p>
<div style=\"margin-left: 3em; text-align: left; font-size: 1.1em;\"><code>
<pre>document.timeline.play(
new SeqGroup([
new Animation(...),   // Curtains open
new ParGroup([
new Animation(...), // Penguin A
new Animation(...)  // Penguin B
]),
new Animation(...)    // Curtains close
])
);</pre>
</code><p><code></code></p></div>
<div style=\"color: #777;\">On a side-note, we’ve had some feedback about <code>ParGroup</code> and <code>SeqGroup</code> being a bit cryptic, especially for anyone not familiar with SMIL (which is pretty much everyone). <code>ParallelGroup</code> would be more readable but it’s a lot to type for something we expect authors to use a lot. I wonder if just <code>Parallel</code> would make sense? Perhaps this could be a named constructor for <code>ParallelGroup</code>? If you have any suggestions we’d love to hear them. Either respond here, or, better yet, send a mail to <a href=\"mailto:public-fx@w3.org\">public-fx@w3.org</a> with subject <q>[web-animations]</q>.</div>
<p>The mapping of timing groups to SVG and CSS has yet to be worked out.</p>
<h3>Future extensions to timing groups</h3>
<p>One common request that arises in regards to timing groups is the ability to set the duration of the group and specify the duration of the children as fractions of that parent. That sort of adaptive duration is something that’s quite useful but also can easily become complex—like CSS flexbox in the temporal domain. It’s something we’ll look at in a future version but for now we’re comfortable it can be added to the model and API fairly naturally.</p>

<p>First, Robert Longson pointed out to me that there were a couple more features that SVG text now supports since the rewrite landed:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use ‘font-variant: small-caps’.</li>
<li>SVG text can be copied to the clipboard with Cmd/Ctrl+C once selected.</li>
<li>SVG DOM methods for selecting text – selectSubString and deselectAll – are now implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, the latest Firefox Nightly (2013-07-08) now supports the <code>textLength=\"\"</code> and <code>lengthAdjust=\"\"</code> attributes on the <code><text></code> element (but not yet on child text content elements).  These attributes are useful if, for example, you have some text in a diagram that you want to ensure does not run over some other elements, which might happen if the font used is not present on the client, or if text layout resulted in a total text width different from what the author expected.</p>
<p>You can see the effect of using <code>textLength=\"...\" lengthAdjust=\"spacingAndGlyphs\"</code> in this example:</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>
<p>If you mouse over the ellipses, the text is changed to use a monospaced font.  This would normally make the text wider than the ellipse, but the use of <code>lengthAdjust=\"spacingAndGlyphs\"</code> scales the text so that it retains its specified width.</p>" nil nil "4e2b43f29ec9862e82e91b2ab3bc3220") (297 (20955 50159 948387) "https://todesschaf.org/posts/2013/07/09/gsoc-http2-header-compression.html" "Nick Hurley: GSoC HTTP/2 Header Compression" "Nick Hurley" "Tue, 09 Jul 2013 00:44:41 +0000" "<p>Just a quick (and awesome!) note.

The UK’s General Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) has a system called TEMPORA. TEMPORA is the signals intelligence community’s first “full-take” Internet buffer that doesn’t care about content type and pays only marginal attention to the Human Rights Act. It snarfs everything, in a rolling buffer to allow retroactive investigation without missing a single bit. Right now the buffer can hold three days of traffic, but that’s being improved. Three days may not sound like much, but remember that that’s not metadata. “Full-take” means it doesn’t miss anything, and ingests the entirety of each circuit’s capacity. If you send a single ICMP packet 5 and it routes through the UK, we get it. If you download something and the CDN (Content Delivery Network) happens to serve from the UK, we get it. If your sick daughter’s medical records get processed at a London call center … well, you get the idea. … As a general rule, so long as you have any choice at all, you should never route through or peer with the UK under any circumstances.

I joined the Bugzilla project in August 2004 (already 9 years ago) and<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?field0-0-0=assigned_to&limit=0&resolution=FIXED&type0-0-0=substring&value0-0-0=lpsolit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bugs fixed by LpSolit\"> fixed more than 1600 bugs </a>(including a few bugs in Bonsai, Doctor and Testopia). I became an official reviewer in December 2004, only 4 months after my first contribution, and reviewed patches in more than 2000 bugs. I also got approval privileges in January 2007, meaning that I had the responsibility to grant/deny approval for the last 6.5 years, and approved no less than 1500 patches to be committed into the source code. I’m also the QA manager for the Bugzilla project since July 2005 and so I am responsible to make sure Bugzilla quality is good enough before each new release. That’s a lot of work, and takes a lot of my free time and energy.</p>
<p>In the last few months, my free time was pretty limited and so my contributions to the project were mostly to triage new bugs, set blockers for the next releases, approve (or reject) reviewed patches, and help fixing blockers and security bugs. But now that my free time increased a bit again, I realized that my motivation to write new patches, either bug fixes or new features, and my motivation to review patches in my too long review queue are gone. And to lead a project correctly (I’m actually an assistant project lead, the project lead being justdave), you need to put time and energy into it to not be the bottleneck in the development of the application. And so without enough motivation and energy anymore it’s time for me to resign my role as assistant project lead. This means that decisions about the direction Bugzilla should take no longer belong to me. So please stop marking bugs as WONTFIX because LpSolit (me) said he didn’t agree with such or such new feature; my opinion is no longer relevant. <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<p>Those who know me shouldn’t be too surprised by my decision. <a href=\"http://lpsolit.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/from-bugzilla-2-18-to-4-0-and-beyond/\" title=\"From Bugzilla 2.18 to 4.0 and beyond\">Two years ago, I was very close from taking the same decision</a>. The only reason I didn’t was because mkanat left the Bugzilla project to go work for Google, and it wasn’t the right time to also leave the project. So I stayed involved two additional years to help with the release of Bugzilla 4.2 and 4.4, but now it’s really time for me to say goodbye. This also means you shouldn’t ask me to review your patches anymore. Those should be addressed to another reviewer (glob, dkl, justdave). I will keep my reviewer and QA manager hats for now, but really stop asking me for review (unless it’s a security or critical bug which requires my skills).</p>
<p>It was a really great and fantastic experience to work with other Bugzilla developers and contributors, and I wish all the best for the future of Bugzilla. <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>

<p>There are two big changes to <a href=\"http://mozillians.org/\">mozillians.org</a>, our community directory, this week. We launched a new design for the homepage and we also updated the style across the whole site.</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_441\" style=\"width: 310px;\"><a href=\"http://dailycavalier.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/new-mozillians-org-homepage.png\"><img alt=\"The new Mozillians homepage allows you to search for Mozillians with public profiles.\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-441\" height=\"172\" src=\"http://dailycavalier.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/new-mozillians-org-homepage-300x172.png\" width=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The new Mozillians homepage allows you to search for Mozillians with public profiles.</p></div>
<h3>A redesigned homepage</h3>
<p>Public search: A few months ago we rolled out the ability to have <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2013/04/01/you-can-now-have-a-mozillians-profile/\">public profiles</a>, and now you can search for those profiles without logging into the site. If you haven’t already, now is a good time to <a href=\"https://mozillians.org/user/edit\">edit your profile</a> so it shows up in public search results. This will make it easier for Mozillians as well as your friends and family to see your profile.</p>
<p>Better browsing: Browsing through groups and functional areas is improved, including the option to sort groups in different ways.</p>
<p>Announcements: To better share future changes to mozillians.org, we have added an announcements section on the homepage for logged-in users. When there aren’t any announcements to show, you’ll see some fun facts about Mozillians based on information in the database.</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_442\" style=\"width: 310px;\"><a href=\"http://dailycavalier.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/new-mozillians-org-homepage-logged-in.png\"><img alt=\"    The new logged-in view lets you browse groups more easily and also shows announcements.\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-442\" height=\"178\" src=\"http://dailycavalier.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/new-mozillians-org-homepage-logged-in-300x178.png\" width=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The new logged-in view lets you browse groups more easily and also shows announcements.</p></div>
<h3>A new look</h3>
<p>As we were redesigning the homepage, it also made sense to update the styles on the whole site. We worked with the fantastic <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Engagement/Brand_Engagement\">Brand Engagement team</a> on the visuals and direction. We especially love their <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/styleguide/\"> Style Guide</a>, which made the styling much easier for us.</p>
<h3>Take it for a spin</h3>
<p>As with many site redesigns, this is a large release with big changes to our codebase. If you see anything that looks weird, we’d like to make it better. Please <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Community%20Tools&component=Phonebook\">file a bug</a> and we’ll look into it.</p>
<p>Mozillians, this site is for you. All 3,500+ Mozilla volunteers and paid staff. We hope you enjoy the new homepage and styles for the site. And we’ve just begun. We’ll be fixing minor UI bugs and giving profiles some attention in a redesign soon.</p>

<li>Anton Kovalyov landed changes to the GUI that show the event timelines for multiple threads in a synchronised way.  The multithreaded aspects of the profiler are stabilising nicely.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Multi-thread profiling support is ready.  Select ‘Multi-Thread’ when profiling to watch any registered thread.  For now a local build is recommended to tweak which threads you want to profile.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Android Java profiling support is ready.  Set ‘profiler.java’ to true on the host desktop machine before connecting to your phone. A new timeline will appear that will represent main java thread execution.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Native unwind for Android nightlies is now available.  Select ‘breakpad’ in the GUI on the host desktop machine when connecting to your phone.  With this, full symbolicated profiles are available.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Native unwind on Android uses the ARM-specific EXIDX unwind format.  Addition of it to the nightly .apk increases size by about 2.5MB (10% ish), which is not a bad result for near-complete unwindability of libxul and the other libraries.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There was some additional work to improve the EXIDX unwind performance and stability to usable levels (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=883126\">883126</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=882903\">882903</a>).  Sampling beyond 200Hz is viable on a dual-core Cortex A9.  Investigations are in progress to improve unwind speed and reduce memory use, to levels that would make it useful for Firefox OS.</li>

I suspect that those figures would be depressing..</p>
<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/deezthugs\">David Dahl</a> asked me a good question at the last Mozilla Summit in 2010, well before I really started contributing to Mozilla. He asked, “What is it you want to do Erik?”, and I had no real answer, which depressed the hell out of me. At the time I had been writing quite a few UserScripts, Ubiquity commands, Jetpacks, and I loved Firefox which enabled all of this. I had also just started spending the time to figure out how Firefox extensions worked, and started contributing to my long time friend Greasemonkey which gave me great pleasure. I was out of work at the time, doing odd jobs here at there, surviving on the bare essentials, and spending all of my time in a dark room, coding my ass off.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that I was not optimistic about the future. I could feel an undefinable drive to keep working, but I had no understanding why, nor belief that any of my efforts were worth while. My old friends from high-school were getting jobs at the post office and auto-repair shops, selling drugs or collecting unemployment checks, drinking away their nights, pissing away their days, and loving it as far as I could tell. While my old friends from UBC weren’t doing much better, and I had absolutely no interest in sharing their fates. So I avoided these people, they were and are nice people, and spending time with them in the past was an educating and empowering experience that I no longer had any use for. I felt quite alone, a feeling that has stayed with me since and had been hard to shake, until I visited Mozilla HQ.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.azarask.in/\">Aza Raskin</a> had saved me with a single email, asking me if I would be a Jetpack Ambassador, and unknowingly I started a meditation on what it meant (for me) to be a Mozillian, because I knew I would like to become one, or die trying.</p>
<p>Again, my drive was undefinable to me at the time, I could not really answer well enough (to satisfy myself) why it was I wanted to be a Mozillian. I had read <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto/\">Mozilla’s manifesto</a> and I liked it, but I could not say that it moviated me, I take too much pride in being a nonconformist to subscribe to a manifesto, and frankly I thought it was too internet specific, saying things like ‘the internet should be this’ and ‘the internet should not be that’ which is all well and good, but this was not going to be a document that got me out of bed every day. It is closer than anything I had ever read to this very day though.</p>
<p>It’s funny how a revelation can at once seem so awesome and so obvious at the same time. I’ve always known why I drag myself out of bed each morning, I just couldn’t say it. I want to empower others, through thought and deeds, I want to make life more secure and productive, for myself and others. I am by no means be the best or most capable at achieving this, and I’m certainly under no such illusion, but that is what motivates me and that is why Voldzilla exists.</p>" nil nil "c3b9c8751536084c4b850579ff21a4f2") (287 (20954 29014 923758) "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BenjaminKerensaDotComMozilla/~3/9q7RaF3E6zk/mozilla-at-oscon" "Benjamin Kerensa: Mozilla at OSCON" "Benjamin Kerensa" "Sat, 06 Jul 2013 23:45:15 +0000" "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"thickbox no_icon\" href=\"http://cdn.benjaminkerensa.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mozilla_wordmark.png\" title=\"mozilla wordmark 300x121 Mozilla at OSCON\"><img alt=\"mozilla wordmark 300x121 Mozilla at OSCON\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1973 aligncenter\" height=\"121\" src=\"http://cdn.benjaminkerensa.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mozilla_wordmark-300x121.png\" title=\"Mozilla at OSCON\" width=\"300\" /></a>If you are attending O’Reilly Open Source Convention this year then be sure to attend one of the great talks being given by Mozillians this year:</p>

The audience is incredibly creative and mixed and the workshops range from the traditional web tech topics to robotics to hacking for good and up to getting kids to build their first machines.</p>
<p>This year I got invited to give the closing talk of the Barcelona instance of WebVisions and I went all out on that one. Instead of giving a detailed technical talk I took the opportunity to remind ourselves of the importance of a web for everyone and how we fail at delivering that old dream of its inventors.</p>
<p>The <a href=\"http://icant.co.uk/talks/h5/webvisions2013.html?full#makers\">slides (without notes) are available on the web</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56gRF-ypBM4\">video of the screencast is on YouTube</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is a (long but also short) summary of what I was talking about: <img alt=\"please don't hurt the web\" src=\"http://icant.co.uk/talks/h5/pictures/sotb13/please-dont-hurt-the-web-new.png\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>I started the talk with an example how things can go wrong when they should be right. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLuW-GBaJ8k\">Richard Strauss’ “Also sprach Zarathustra”</a> inspired by <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7205\">Friedrich Nietzsche’s book with the same title</a> is an iconic piece of music. It was brought to a totally new audience with its use in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RDeDVu5fFI\">2001 – A space odyssey</a>, the – in its own right – iconic movie by Stanley Kubrick. Now if you <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpJ6anurfuw\">listen to this version</a>,  however, it sounds more like terrible things being done to elephants than the original song.</p>
<p>What happened? Were the musicians just terrible? Yes, but also, no. The second version is by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_Sinfonia\">Portsmouth Sinfonia</a>, a classical ensemble put together by either people who did not know how to play, but also by people who are gifted musicians, but weren’t allowed to play the instrument they know. It was a tongue-in-cheek experiment to see if musical genius is something that is given or can get taught to anyone with the right amount of effort.</p>
<p>The horrid, cacophonous outcome of this shows one thing – the wrong instruments in the hands of the right experts will not yield good results. And this is the vibe I am getting a lot when people speak about “the mobile web”. When smartphones came about everybody got incredibly excited: web developers saw a whole new market opening and new, interesting challenges coming towards them and native developers out of a sudden were asked to build things with web technology (this includes in my book Flash developers, who out of a sudden were asked to “do <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> as this works on iPhone”). The new form factor of smartphones brought up some new challenges for developers, who, until then, were used to catering to desktop users on fast, stable connections with computers that were in a certain range of resolutions. Out of a sudden, we found ourselves with new challenges:</p>
<p></p><ul><li class=\"active\">Unknown, smaller screen size</li><li>New ways of interaction – touch, voice</li><li>Flaky, slow connections</li><li>Limited data plans</li><li>Less patient end users</li></ul><p></p>
<p>Or so we told ourselves and people got very excited and worried about all these “new” things. We threw out a lot of truisms like “users on the phone are always busy and want a few big buttons as the interface” and started to consider locking our solutions down to one phone on one platform the only solution to delivering “exciting experiences”. If you took your job as a web developer serious though, then none of this should be new to you. We never were able to tell what the end user has at her disposal to consume what we put on the web and that is the beauty of it!</p>
<p>When Tim Berners-Lee came up with the idea of the web, the concept of what hardware and in what resolution or what connectivity it is consumed in was never, ever included. It is a system to deliver content and get it consumed by other computers. Or, as stated in the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility\"><span class=\"caps\">W3C </span>Accessibility guidelines</a>:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>In other words: <strong>fiercely flexible</strong> is what the web should be. And the advent of smartphones and mobile computing consuming web content rather than just email and text messages brought this original idea more than ever back into the spotlight.</p>
<p>And instead of embracing it and finally giving in and saying “well, we have no clue what people use, so let’s use software to do what it does best – test and then adapt” we overload users on the desktop with lots and lots of widgets and an avalanche of content and we limit the mobile interfaces to the bare minimum, in many cases not even in a working fashion. The current mobile web is a failure, so much that clever marketers manage to sell to many companies the idea that asking users to “download the app” when they come to the site using a mobile device is the best choice. It reminds me of popup windows and Flash tunnels – both of which, luckily, are hardly ever used any longer.</p>
<p>Which is weird and disheartening seeing just how blessed we are these days with great tools to learn our trade. There are dozens of online course companies out there – many of them free and even then very high quality. Our browsers have amazing debugging tools and there is a large amount of collaborative editing tools out there where you can try and debug together with other people.</p>
<p>How is it we are losing ground? How is it that webstandards based interfaces are such a disappointment? Well, there are a few reasons:</p>
<p>First, we are too busy fixing things that are not a problem yet. The whole web world is abuzz trying to find solutions for the “retina problem”. We have a few very shiny, very cool devices that need high resolution images to look good. We also have an infrastructure that doesn’t support that much image data to be transferred in time. So we bash our heads together trying to solve that problem. Why? Why not ask the companies who break the web with their proprietary hardware and secret roadmaps to find a way to fix it in their hardware? Why should it be upon us as developers to reverse engineer and hack around issues that are man-made?</p>
<p>The very frustrating part about this is that we are solving a problem of a small minority of people. Granted, the richest ones and the ones that consume the most. But the web is more, and we should be thinking about tapping into the group of those that are not on the web right now, but have demands and needs that could be fulfilled by it.</p>
<p>Secondly a big problem that we have is reminiscent of the Portsmouth Sinfonia: we have a lot of developers doing design and designers doing development. Either because they are asked to, or because they are deluded enough that they think they can do everything or because our project plans are not catered for allowing specialists to do what they do best but instead to roll out the product as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Almost weekly there is some rant by developers that <span class=\"caps\">CSS</span> is too hard, not logical enough and needs replacement. Or designers answering “just use a jQuery plugin” for any problem that comes up in web development rather than finding a much simpler, more scalable and easier to understand JavaScript solution.</p>
<p>Maybe instead of trying to replace something we don’t get along with we find a person who loves doing it and partner with them? If I hire a plasterer to fix my ceiling I don’t expect him also to check out the plumbing of my house or build me a nice cupboard. Instead of ranting and calling a technology inapplicable we should leave it to other experts to do that part of the job for us and deliver the product with us.</p>
<p>All in all, this is just laziness or unwillingness to learn something new. We  keep to our small worlds and see everything as a nail as we have one hammer at our disposal – not realising that in many cases the nail turns out to be a thumb once we have a go at it. A developer giving other developers design advice on Stackoverflow telling them to “use a layout table, as <span class=\"caps\">CSS</span> isn’t ready for this” or a designer telling other designers to “just use this library” without understanding what it does under the hood is stagnation and fleeing into quick solution land where everything can be healed by applying a band-aid.</p>
<p>One big thing is people claiming that they have no talent for programming or others for interface design. One person that told this the right way is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross\">Bob Ross</a>:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Talent is a pursued interest. In other words, anything that you are willing to practice, you can do.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Practice makes perfect, and you can only get better by learning from people who know the thing you want to learn. That is why the most important thing we need to do as creators of the web now is to collaborate and learn from another.<br />
We are experts and experts use expert tools and talk to other experts. They do not just go and buy the first thing that promises a fast solution. That’s what frauds do. If we don’t want to be frauds, we should stop doing a few things:</p>
<p></p><ul><li>Looking for technical solutions on Google. This is what underpaid helpdesk people do. “Any answer will do”</li><li>“Use this, it will solve all your problems” is nonsense used in advertising</li><li>Finding out the “how” doesn’t give you anything if it doesn’t answer the “why” at the same time.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>All of these lead not to solutions and products, they lead to stop-gap solutions. And as we are normally not on the same project for a long time following these principles means we fill up the web with quick hacks and stop-gap solutions.</p>
<p>Instead we should tap into the community when we have a problem:</p>
<p></p><ul><li class=\"active\">Write a demo of your problem and post it on <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net\">JSFiddle</a>, <a href=\"http://jsbin.com/\">JSBin</a>, <a href=\"http://dabblet.com/\">Dabblet</a>, <a href=\"http://codepen.io/\">Codepen</a> or <em>whatever</em> has collaborative coding.</li><li class=\"active\">Go on Twitter/Google+/Facebook and ask people</li><li class=\"active\">Let’s use <strong>#cssissue</strong> or <strong>#jsissue</strong> as hashtags? That’s what the cool kids use!</li><li class=\"active\">Get fixes and share your learnings with the community</li></ul><p></p>
<p>In other words: we should talk more. The web became what it was by collaboration, sharing and open discussion of problems and solutions. If we make these work around code and tangible examples we can avoid a lot of nonsensical, dogmatic discussions and “meh, just use $x” answers.</p>
<p>We forgot how to share knowledge, as we are stuck in a rat-race about innovating to “keep up with native”.</p>
<p>The question is though, what is the future of the web? I don’t know, but I feel very deeply that it will not be about a certain hardware. I also know deep down that it will not be about one browser. I also know that there is no such thing as an <span class=\"caps\">SDK</span> or an <span class=\"caps\">IDE</span> for the web (something native developers keep asking for when they start building web apps). And I know for sure that it is not achievable when mainstream media and governments keep trying to tell us that the web needs to be controlled to avoid people getting content they shouldn’t get. That last ship has sailed recently with – ironically – the release of a certain powerpoint presentation.</p>
<p>Is it trying to give users the same experience native solutions do? I don’t think so – at all. I find apps to be a step back and a step into a direction of controlled consumption rather than distributed discovery and consumption. And it hurts me to talk to new developers asking me where they can get a certain hardware before they can build their first web app. No, you do not need the hardware to build an app – you need the knowledge and the tools and both are available in the form of standards and freely available information and editors. The latter will sooner or later simply be part of the browser.</p>
<p>It hurts me to see that developers start thinking they need to “pay to play”. This is a horrible step backwards to me. The web is there for anyone to become a publisher. Closed environments work very much against that idea.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that sooner or later people would try to rein the web in and make it easier to sell and digest. This is how selling always worked and it is actually based on a principle defined in 1955 by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Lebow\">Victor Lebow</a> in <a href=\"http://whatdoino-steve.blogspot.co.uk/2007/12/victor-lebows-complete-original-1955.html\">an article in the Journal of Retailing</a>:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Our enormously productive economy … demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals. That we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption … we need things consumed, burned up, replaced and discarded at an ever-accelerating rate.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>In other words, things need to break. The phone has to die, so people buy a new one. That doesn’t work with intangible things like software and with things that are distributed and copied as soon as they become available. Which is why it needs even more to make people consume more. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Stevens\">Clifford Brooks-Stevens</a> defined the priniciple to make that happen in 1954 already, that of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence\">planned obsolescence</a>:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Planned style obsolescence occurs when marketers change the styling of products so customers will purchase products more frequently. The style changes are designed to make owners of the old model feel out of date.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Do end users really need Retina displays? Or is it a wish, is it a need caused by damn good advertising and giving them a feeling of “not belonging to the hip people” when they don’t have it? As early as 1960 the concept of planned obsolescence was critiqued. My favourite quote is by Vance Packard in “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Waste-Makers-Vance-Packard/dp/1935439375\">The Waste Makers</a>“:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>“The systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently discontented individuals”.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>I am afraid that this dark prediction is coming true. Yes, Moore’s Law is in full effect and things get faster, smaller and cheaper all the time but not everybody who buys an iPhone just to go online can really afford it. And whatever new and cool we buy, we are annoyed with a few weeks later and consider it outdated.</p>
<p>How can we break this cycle? How can we bring the original ideas of the web to the mobile space, rather than the self-destructive cycle of perishable and – by design – soon obsolete products?</p>
<p>I am very happy to be part of one of the anti-movements of this: Firefox OS. FirefoxOS is a completely open operating system, built on web standards and available for download. It is not there to kill iOS or Android. It is there to bring web connectivity to the people who do not have it yet and who could never afford to be part of the race for new, faster, higher-resolutioned and shinier every half year. It has a few unique features:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>It is targeted at new, emerging markets</strong> – true, the first country FirefoxOS phones are available right now is Spain, but that was a decision by our partner Telefonica. In the long run Firefox OS is going where the other players don’t bother to go – yet. If they go later on and offer affordable hardware, we as Mozilla have reached the goal we set ourselves: opening the mobile space</li><li>It runs on very affordable hardware</li><li>There is no credit card needed – apps can be bought on the phone bill or via prepaid cards (this is a big obstacle for people)</li><li>It is web technologies through and through – the OS and Apps are <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span></li><li>You have full hardware access via <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI\">open APIs</a></li><li>We have 21 mobile partners and 6 hardware partners</li></ul><p></p>
<p>Apps for the OS can come from the marketplace – much like any other mobile platform – but you can also easily make them installable from the web with a simple <span class=\"caps\">JS API</span> call. A web page can become an app just by defining a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Manifest?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Apps%2FManifest\">manifest file</a>.</p>
<p>The really disruptive idea, however, is that Firefox OS turns the “find app, install app, use app” on its head. Instead of having to find an app by name in a marketplace, the search functionality of the OS allows you to find applications by entering a search term, like a band name, a movie name or anything else. After the system found an applicable app in the marketplace or on the web it shows you its icon. Clicking the icon sends the search term to the app and you immediately get what you came for. No need to enter the data again or go through an install process. If you like the app, you can long-tap it and install it. Your <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> mobile-optimised web sites become the ad for your app. You can see it all <a href=\"http://icant.co.uk/talks/h5/pictures/sotb13/dynamicsearch.mp4\">in the following video</a>:</p>
<p><video class=\"middle\" controls=\"\" height=\"450\"><source src=\"http://icant.co.uk/talks/h5/pictures/sotb13/dynamicsearch.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /><source src=\"http://icant.co.uk/talks/h5/pictures/sotb13/dynamicsearch.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" /></video></p>
<p>All in all, Firefox OS promises web developers a few things:</p>
<p></p><ul><li>A whole new audience</li><li><span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> without the lock-out</li><li>Your web site is your ad!</li><li>Minimal extra work, it works across platforms</li></ul><p></p>
<p>You don’t need to build apps for Firefox <span class=\"caps\">OS </span>– you build them for the web and Firefox OS gives you the most APIs to play with and full access to the hardware.</p>
<p>All in all, we need <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/\">makers of the web</a> to unite and to ensure that what we know goes to the next generation. If we do not fight this fight right now, the web as we know it will play a second role to closed systems. Those will fade away – as they always do – but, to me, it seems like a big waste to spend lots of money and effort when we already have something that works. You can innovate faster and better in a closed space – no doubt about that – but being flexible makes you succeed in the longer run and reach people you don’t even know yet and who are hungry to get something new.</p>" nil nil "ba20633c02e535c7971a4be0e851a529") (283 (20954 29014 911805) "http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/?2013/07/01/840-exempi-221" "Hub =?utf-8?Q?Figui=C3=A8re=3A?= Exempi 2.2.1" "hub" "Tue, 02 Jul 2013 00:25:30 +0000" "<p>Just a quick note to announce that I released <a href=\"http://libopenraw.freedesktop.org/wiki/Exempi/\">Exempi 2.2.1</a>.

One way is differential pricing – charge more at peak times. Another way is energy storage, so you can supply more at peak times. One method of storage is to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air_energy_storage\">store the energy using compressed air</a>. The disadvantage is that compressing the air gives off heat, and re-expanding it requires heat. Not supplying heat during re-expansion makes the storage much less efficient. </p>
<p>So which industry has large and fairly constant power costs it would like to reduce by buying some of that power at off-peak prices, equipment which can be placed anywhere, including where land prices are cheap, plus a lot of waste heat it doesn’t know what to do with?</p>
<p>Someone should come up with a gas compression power storage system for data centres.</p>
<p>Cost of power, ballpark: $0.06 per kWH peak (say 8am – 6pm), $0.03 off-peak<br />
Power consumption of server: 1KW<br />
Current cost of power per server per day: $1.02<br />
Potential saving per server per year if all power used were priced at the off-peak price: $110</p>
<p>One issue is that a 5l bottle <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air_storage#Energy_density_and_efficiency\">can store</a> 500kJ of energy (0.14 kwH), so you’d need 500l per server. That’s a lot, so you may not be able to get the full saving unless you use an underground cavern rather than surface storage tanks. But if land is cheap, you could make a dent in your power bill.</p>

<p></p><ul><li>Forms are <strong>incredibly</strong> important for the web. People enter data into them and the data goes to a server (via <span class=\"caps\">HTTP</span> and a page reload, into a frame, or via <span class=\"caps\">XHR</span>).</li><li>Entering forms is annoying and frustrating as in many cases you need to look up data elsewhere (your credit card number, itinerary numbers…). This is why you main goal should be to create a working form that needs the least amount of information labeled in an understandable fashion. The look of the form is less important than that – this pleases us and our clients but a pretty form that isn’t understandable is not good for your users</li><li>A form that points nowhere is not a form. Have an action attribute that points to a server-side script and a submit button to enable sending the form by hitting enter. If and when there is a JS error, people can still send the data which is what you want.</li><li>Label elements are incredibly important. They tell assistive technology what a certain input element is and they allow users to click the label instead of clicking on the small checkbox. This is very important on touch devices (ever tried to check-in at the British Airways boarding pass on your phone? The checkbox is under a link. Guess what I click in 99% of the cases). There are two ways to connect input elements and labels: <ul><li>You can just embed the input in the label:<p></p>

<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\">

</div>
<h3>Quicksearch, I'll Race Ya!</h3>
<p>The most useful tip I know of is to set up a keyword search for the quicksearch box. Open <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/\">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/</a> and right-click the quicksearch box near the top of the page. Select \"Add a keyword for this search…\" and in the keyword field type \"bug.\" You can now search bugzilla using queries like this directly from your Firefox Awesome Bar:</p>
<div class=\"syntax_highlight\"><pre class=\"bash\">bug <span class=\"nu0\">50000</span> <span class=\"co0\"># Open bug 50000.</span></pre></div>
<p>Or even:</p>

<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/beltzner\">Mike Beltzner</a> created an excellent video explaining some of the ways this feature can be used:</p>

<h3>Watching a Component or a Developer</h3>
<p>If you find yourself interested in a certain area of the Mozilla project e.g. Firefox::Developer Tools, you can opt to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=component_watch\">watch its Bugzilla component</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=email\">watch certain users</a>, which is a really neat feature if you’re a new contributor looking to follow the activity of a more experienced developer.</p>
<h3>Autolinkification</h3>
<p>Bugzilla comments are plain text - so typing <U> will produce less-than, U, greater-than rather than underlined text. However, Bugzilla will automatically make hyperlinks out of certain sorts of text in comments. For example, the text \"http://www.bugzilla.org\" will be turned into a link: http://www.bugzilla.org. Other strings which get linkified in the obvious manner are:</p>
<ol>
<li>bug 12345</li>
<li>comment 7</li>
<li>bug 23456, comment 53</li>
<li>attachment 4321</li>
<li>mailto:george@example.com</li>
<li>george@example.com</li>
<li>ftp://ftp.mozilla.org</li>
<li>Most other sorts of URL</li>
</ol>
<p>A corollary here is that if you type a bug number in a comment, you should put the word \"bug\" before it, so it gets autolinkified for the convenience of others.</p>
<h3>Is your Bugzilla Butt-Ugly?</h3>
<p>You are probably still using the default theme. This can be easily remedied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click \"Preferencies\" -> \"General Preferences\"</li>
<li>Under \"Bugzilla's general appearance (skin)\" select \"Mozilla\"</li>
</ul>
<p>Now your Bugzilla looks <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2iOCHhJVhE\">sexy and you know it</a>!</p>
<h3>Does your Bugmail make your Eyes Bleed?</h3>
<p>Well, you probably have Bugzilla set up to use the default email format (text):</p>

<p>Switching this to HTML format makes them 1000 times easier to read, especially on a phone. Don't look for it under the \"Email Preferences\" tab though, that would be way too easy.</p>

<li>Click \"Preferencies\" -> \"General Preferences\"</li>

<h3>Bugzilla Extensions to Rock your World</h3>
<p>There are a few great extensions available that make Bugzilla a more pleasurable experience. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/bugzillajs/\">BugzillaJS</a>: Created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gkoberger\">Gregory Koberger</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rik24d\">Anthony Ricaud</a>. This extension adds keyboard shortcuts, quick file box, inline image / github previews, relative timestamps, Gravatars and more. More information about features is available on the extensions AMO page. This extension contains almost all of Bugzilla Tweak's features and more. You can contribute to the addon <a href=\"https://github.com/gkoberger/BugzillaJS\">here</a></li>
<li><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/bugzilla-tweaks/\">Bugzilla Tweaks</a>: Created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ehsanakhgari\">Ehsan Akhgari</a>, Dave Lawrence and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/globau\">Byron Jones</a>. This extension adds a bunch of features that do not appear to be documented anywhere. These are features such as adding \"Copy Check-in Comment\" to the context menu. If anybody knows how to contribute to this extension then please let me know.</li>
<li><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/github-tweaks-for-bugzilla/\">Github tweaks for Bugzilla</a>: Created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dietrich\">Dietrich Ayala</a>. This extension allows for better Github and Bugzilla integration. On a pull-request page, it adds a new button for submitting the pull-request as an attachment to a bug in bugzilla.mozilla.org. The bug id can be specified by starting your pull request title with \"bug ######\". Your Bugzilla credentials are pulled out of Firefox's password manager. You can contribute to this extension <a href=\"https://github.com/autonome/Github-Bugzilla-Tweaks\">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href=\"http://harthur.github.io/bugzilla-todos/\">Bugzilla TODOs</a>: This is not an extension but a really useful live dashboard created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/harthvader\">Heather Arthur</a>. It contains five tabs (To Review, To Check In, To Nag, To Fix and To Respond) and, because it is live, it is updated automagically. I keep this open as a pinned tab so that I can instantly (via the favicon) see if somebody wants something from me. You can contribute to this handy little web app <a href=\"https://github.com/harthur/bugzilla-todos\">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p>Use attachments, rather than comments, for large chunks of ASCII data, such as trace, debugging output files, or log files. That way, it doesn't bloat the bug for everyone who wants to read it, and cause people to receive fat, useless mails.</p>
<p>Trim screenshots. There's no need to show the whole screen if you are pointing out a single-pixel problem.</p>
<p>Don't attach simple test cases (e.g. one HTML file, one CSS file and an image) as a ZIP file. Instead, upload them in reverse order and edit the referring file so that they point to the attached files. This way, the test case works immediately out of the bug.</p>
<p>Bugzilla stores and uses a Content-Type for each attachment (e.g. text/html). To download an attachment as a different Content-Type (e.g. application/xhtml+xml), you can override this using a 'content-type' parameter on the URL:</p><p>
</p><div class=\"syntax_highlight\"><pre class=\"html5\"><span class=\"sc1\">&content-type=text/plain.</span></pre></div>
<h3>Etiquette</h3>
<p>If you are changing the fields on a bug, only comment if either you have something pertinent to say, or Bugzilla requires it. Otherwise, you may spam people unnecessarily with bug mail. To take an example: a user can set up their account to filter out messages where someone just adds themselves to the CC field of a bug (which happens a lot.) If you come along, add yourself to the CC field, and add a comment saying \"Adding self to CC\", then that person gets a pointless piece of mail they would otherwise have avoided.</p>
<p>Don't use sigs in comments. Signing your name (\"Bill\") is acceptable, if you do it out of habit, but full mail/news-style four line ASCII art creations are not.</p>
<p>You should also read <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html\">Bugzilla’s etiquette guidelines</a> to learn what behaviors are acceptable for Bugzilla users. In general, just be a nice person and everyone will be happy!</p>

</ol>
<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p>Use attachments, rather than comments, for large chunks of ASCII data, such as trace, debugging output files, or log files. That way, it doesn't bloat the bug for everyone who wants to read it, and cause people to receive fat, useless mails.</p>
<p>Trim screenshots. There's no need to show the whole screen if you are pointing out a single-pixel problem.</p>
<p>Don't attach simple test cases (e.g. one HTML file, one CSS file and an image) as a ZIP file. Instead, upload them in reverse order and edit the referring file so that they point to the attached files. This way, the test case works immediately out of the bug.</p>
<p>Bugzilla stores and uses a Content-Type for each attachment (e.g. text/html). To download an attachment as a different Content-Type (e.g. application/xhtml+xml), you can override this using a 'content-type' parameter on the URL:</p><p>
</p><div class=\"syntax_highlight\"><pre class=\"html5\"><span class=\"sc1\">&content-type=text/plain.</span></pre></div>
<h3>Etiquette</h3>
<p>If you are changing the fields on a bug, only comment if either you have something pertinent to say, or Bugzilla requires it. Otherwise, you may spam people unnecessarily with bug mail. To take an example: a user can set up their account to filter out messages where someone just adds themselves to the CC field of a bug (which happens a lot.) If you come along, add yourself to the CC field, and add a comment saying \"Adding self to CC\", then that person gets a pointless piece of mail they would otherwise have avoided.</p>
<p>Don't use sigs in comments. Signing your name (\"Bill\") is acceptable, if you do it out of habit, but full mail/news-style four line ASCII art creations are not.</p>
<p>You should also read <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html\">Bugzilla’s etiquette guidelines</a> to learn what behaviors are acceptable for Bugzilla users. In general, just be a nice person and everyone will be happy!</p>

<h4><strong>Firefox OS doesn’t reach the user by itself</strong></h4>
<p>One important difference that we’ve had to adapt to to develop Firefox OS is that before it reaches the user, an operating system needs to integrate with other parts, created by other organizations. Unlike the browser, the operating system is not something that we give to users by itself. It is only one layer that goes into a mobile phone and it is important that it connects and collaborates with the other parts that make up a phone experience.</p>
<p>That meant that when we thought about the features and functions that we would like to build in a device there were a lot that we had not a lot of influence over, because we were not creating them. Before we could start thinking about where Firefox OS could excel at, we needed to separate its function within a phone and the mobile ecosystem from that of the other players. In other words, we needed to know what is <strong>the job to be done of Firefox OS</strong>.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>There are 5 layers in the mobile ecosystem</strong></h4>
<p>To do this we started breaking down the elements of the mobile ecosystem and define what are the different parts that interact with each other, what is their function and what type of organizations are producing them.</p>
<p>To do this, we looked at what are the steps that content needs to go through from when it’s created by the developer to when it is consumed by the user. A day in the life of content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information is created and stored on servers by <strong>developers</strong> in form of <strong>content</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bytes need to be <strong>transported</strong> to their destination, a job assigned to the <strong>network equipment providers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As a copy of the information leaves the server, it needs to know to which destination to go. It is important that the content is returned to the person who actually asked for it, not to a random one or to the whole network. This job is done by the <strong>network operator</strong>, by means of the IP address, whose key role is that of <strong>authentication</strong> for the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Once it has reached the user, the information still needs to be <strong>processed</strong> on to a screen by a device, which is made by <strong>hardware manufacturers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After it is stored on the hardware, the information is organized and <strong>consumed</strong> by the user through the means of the a <strong>user agent</strong>, which is the operating system. This is where Firefox OS comes in.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h4><strong>Firefox OS is the interface and the data manager for the user</strong></h4>
<p>A user agent is the protective layer between the user and the rest of the ecosystem. It needs to represent the intentions and actions of the end – consumer to the rest of the layers that make up a phone, it needs to translate what is happening at the byte level to the user and in the same time protect against unauthorized access to other data stored on the device.</p>
<p>The <strong>job to be done</strong> of Firefox OS is not one, but several:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is the interface for the user to the entire mobile ecosystem</li>
<li>it represents the user when she wants to interact with the other layers of the phone</li>
<li>it organizes the user’s data</li>
<li>it surfaces the signals sent by the other parts of the phone</li>
<li>it protects the user’s data from unauthorized access</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been using Alembic, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration\">database schema migration</a> tool, for about three months now, and really liking it a lot. I created a blog post that served as a slide deck for an internal team called <a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2013/05/17/migrations-with-alembic-a-lightspeed-tour/\">A lightspeed tour of Alembic</a> as my first stab at user education.</p>
<p>Setting things up initially was pretty simple, but explaining it to a coworker after I’d set everything up for myself proved slightly more difficult. Below are my notes on the differences between <a href=\"http://alembic.readthedocs.org\">Alembic</a> and some other migration tool.</p>
<h4>Terminology</h4>
<p>Alembic calls each migration a <em>revision</em>. Revisions know what order to be run in because each revision is given a <code>down_revision</code> to identify its parent. If <code>down_revision</code> is <code>None</code>, that revision is the very first revision according to Alembic. You can put your whole schema in that revision, or you can just start adding changes to this initial revision. Alembic doesn’t complain either way.</p>
<p>A best practice would likely be putting your entire model into the first revision. I may go back and “fix” this for us later. I opted to just have the default use case be to create a database fresh with a tool we call <code>setupdb_app.py</code>.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to migrate to using alembic, you’ll also need to use SQLAlchemy. I used sqlautocode for my initial schema <a href=\"http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/schema.html#reflecting-database-objects\">reflection</a>, and there’s a new tool <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/agronholm/sqlacodegen/src\">sqlacodegen</a> you may want to check out for generating your SQLAlchemy models for the first time.</p>
<h4>Preparation: edit config and activate a virtualenv</h4>
<p>Our environment was set up per the <a href=\"https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#creating-an-environment\">alembic tutorial for creating an environment</a>. I ran:</p>
<p><code>alembic init alembic</code></p>
<p>I also put an <code>alembic.ini-dist</code> file into our project’s <code>config/</code> directory, and modified <code>alembic/env.py</code> to include our model.</p>
<p>To get started working with an existing install, you’ll need to modify <code>alembic.ini-dist</code>, and copy it to <code>config/alembic.ini</code> to fit your environment – setting the connection string and the path to the alembic directory are the two most important settings. We have a script which creates databases from our <code>models.py</code> called <code>setupdb_app.py</code>. This script takes <code>--database_name</code> as a command-line argument. My default for our project is to use <code>breakpad</code>.</p>
<p>We use a <code>virtualenv</code> called <code>socorro-virtualenv</code>. The virtualenv is created automatically if you run <code>make test</code>. If you’re creating a standalone virtualenv, you can do that with <code>virtualenv socorro-virtualenv</code>. Activate this with <code>. socorro-virtualenv/bin/activate</code>.</p>
<h3>Creating a revision</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a fresh database to work from. For Socorro, the command is: <code>PYTHONPATH=. socorro/external/postgresql/setupdb_app.py --database_name=breakpad</code></li>
<li>Edit <code>models.py</code> with the change to the schema</li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini revision -m 'your message about the migration'</code>. The output will include the name of the new file.</li>
<li>Edit that file as needed <code>alembic/versions/*.py</code></li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini upgrade +1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>If all goes well, your revision is ready! If something goes wrong, edit and try again. The revision will automatically rollback if there are any errors.</p>
<h3>Production deployment</h3>
<p>You’ll need to deploy an <code>alembic.ini</code> on your production database system and probably a <code>virtualenv</code> to support your python modules.</p>
<p>We deploy our virtualenvs with our application, so this step was pretty simple for everything except for alembic itself. The virtualenv put in full, static paths for the python binaries and had some dependencies that I haven’t figured out yet for actually running alembic. To get around this, I created a virualenv locally on the system for the <em>postgres</em> user. Having your postgres user run the migrations locally is a must for me because I need to access the filesystem to pull in new versions of user defined functions stashed in the directory my model lives in.</p>
<p>I just deploy a new release of our application code on the database server locally, and then I run alembic against the <code>versions</code> directory that’s deployed.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>And here’s an FAQ for the common problems folks ran into:</p>
<h4>OOPS I forgot to create a database before I created a revision!</h4>
<p>To “fix” this, try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the database from scratch using your current <code>models.py</code>.</li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini downgrade -1</code></li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini upgrade +1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming your downgrade function works, this should allow you reverse the latest revision and then test your migration.</p>
<h4>Error message: “Only a single head supported so far.”</h4>
<p>See <a href=\"https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#working-with-branches\">Working with Branches</a>.</p>
<h4>I’m using schemas, and alembic doesn’t recognize them when I try to use <code>--autogenerate</code>.</h4>
<p>See <a href=\"http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html?highlight=include_symbol\">include_symbol</a>. And be sure to add this to both the “offline” and “online” versions of the revision code in <code>env.py</code>.</p>
<h4>Error message: Target database is not up to date.</h4>
<p>This means you’ve got a file in your <code>versions</code> directory that contains one or more migrations that haven’t been applied to the current database. You can either apply them with <code>alembic upgrade head</code> or have a look in that directory and remove the migration(s) that you don’t want.</p>" nil nil "7a5f1566b5a8a7ab2abd89ef6627fb07") (273 (20949 15560 843611) "http://blog.finette.com/2013/07/02/design-for-participation" "Pascal Finette: Design for Participation" "Pascal Finette" "Tue, 02 Jul 2013 22:07:00 +0000" "<p>In the current edition of the ISPIM Magazine (a magazine for innovation practitioners) you will find an article from yours truly on \"Design for Participation\".</p>

For example, several language software packages are named after it, such as the <a href=\"http://www.babylon.com\">Babylon</a> electronic dictionary, <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Babel\">MediaWiki’s Babel extension</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_fish_%28The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy%29#Babel_fish\">Babelfish translation service</a> (itself named after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_fish_%28The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy%29#Babel_fish\">Babel fish from The Hitchhiker’s Guide</a>).</p>
<p>In this post I shall use the Tower of Babel in a somewhat more relevant and specific way: It will speak about multilingualism and about Babel itself.</p>
<p>This is how most people saw the Wikipedia article about the Tower of Babel until today:</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2183\" style=\"width: 461px;\"><a href=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-tofu1.png\"><img alt=\"The Tower of Babel article.

Notice the pointless squares in the Akkadian name. They are called “tofu” in the jargon on internationalization programmers.</p></div>
<p>And this is how most people will see it from today:</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2184\" style=\"width: 479px;\"><a href=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-cuneiform.png\"><img alt=\"And we have the name written in real Akkadian cuneiform!\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2184\" src=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-cuneiform.png?w=500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">And we have the name written in real Akkadian cuneiform!</p></div>
<p>Notice how the Akkadian name now appears as actual Akkadian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform\">cuneiform</a>, and not as meaningless squares. Even if you, like most people, cannot actually read cuneiform, you probably understand that showing it this way is more correct, useful and educational.</p>
<p>This is possible thanks to the webfonts technology, which was enabled on the English Wikipedia today. It was already enabled in Wikipedias in some languages for many months, mostly in languages of India, which have severe problems with font support in the common operating systems, but now it’s available in the English Wikipedia, where it mostly serves to show parts of text that are written in exotic fonts.</p>
<p>The current iteration of the webfonts support in Wikipedia is part of a larger project: the Universal Language Selector (ULS). I am very proud to be one of its developers. My team in Wikimedia developed it over the last year or so, during which it underwent a rigorous process of design, testing with dozens of users from different countries, development, bug fixing and deployment. In addition to webfonts it provides an easy way to pick the user interface language, and to type in non-English languages (the latter feature is disabled by default in the English Wikipedia; to enable it, click the cog icon near “Languages” in the sidebar, then click “Input” and “Enable input tools”). In the future it will provide even more abilities, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>If you edit Wikipedia, or want to try editing it, one way in which you could help with the deployment of webfonts would be to make sure that all foreign strings in Wikipedia are marked with the appropriate HTML lang attribute; for example, that every Vietnamese string is marked as <span lang=”vi” dir=”ltr”>. This will help the software apply the webfonts correctly, and in the future it will also help spelling and hyphenation software, etc.</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be possible without the help of many, many people. The developers of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Opera, who developed the support for webfonts in these browsers; The people in Wikimedia who designed and developed the ULS: Alolita Sharma, Arun Ganesh, Brandon Harris, Niklas Laxström, Pau Giner, Santhosh Thottingal and Siebrand Mazeland; The many volunteers who tested ULS and reported useful bugs; The people in Unicode, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Everson\">Michael Everson</a>, who work hard to give a number to every letter in every imaginable alphabet and make massive online multilingualism possible; And last but not least, the talented and generous people who developed all those fonts for the different scripts and released them under Free licenses. I send you all my deep appreciation, as a developer and as a reader of Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Almost two years ago I wrote my first article for the Mozilla Hacks blog about it: <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/07/announcing-boot-to-gecko-b2g-booting-to-the-web/\">Announcing Boot to Gecko (B2G) – Booting to the Web</a>.</p>
<p>Over time, the project developed and a lot of things were ironed out, in establishing what the main focus would be, what the core undertaking encompassed and how to move forward.</p>
<h3>What it really is</h3>
<p>The idea with Firefox OS is to develop a mobile platform that is completely open, and which gives a lot more possibilities to developers, partners and, ultimately, consumers. As I’ve stated many times, the idea is not to compete with iPhones and high-end Android phones, but rather to offer an alternative to emerging markets. How can people who have no phones, or old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone\">feature phones</a>, get access to a smartphone for a really low cost?</p>
<p>How can we continue to ensure that the Internet is as democratic as it can be, that as many as possible can take part and contribute without having to pay many hundreds of US dollars to just get in through the front door?</p>
<p>There’s an estimate of two billion (!) more people coming online in the next few years, and a vast majority of them will do it through mobile. How can we help them, give them affordable options?</p>
<p>We at Mozilla believe we can do that through a completely open device, enabling everyone to contribute to it, afford it and also inspire and influence other players in the mobile field to make their devices more open, more powerful when it comes to the Open Web and priced at a realistic level.</p>
<h4>True open source</h4>
<p>From day one, the repository was available on GitHub. Day one. Everything that has been developed since then has been real-time, and possible for anyone to see, analyze and contribute to. The project first lived in a person’s own repository, but was then moved into a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G\">Mozilla one</a>.</p>
<h3>Introducing WebAPIs</h3>
<p>My own belief – and I’ve stated this many times – is that where I personally think Apple took the wrong path was with how to build things for the iPhone. With the first version they said that all should be the web and you could access it through the mobile Safari web browser. The problem was, of course, that no web site could access anything on the device, like contacts, camera etc. Basically, while the iPhone was a massive leap forward for mobile phones, developers were less than excited with the lack of possibilities for them to build things.</p>
<p>Then Apple went down the path with Objective-C, The App Store and the rest is history. I much more wish that they had chosen to make the web part much stronger, give it access to local device APIs and evolve into the powerful platform it deserves to be. But alas, that didn’t happen, and they went with their own closed and proprietary approach.</p>
<p>So, someone else had to make it happen. In August of 2011, I wrote the <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/08/introducing-webapi/\">first blog post about our WebAPIs iniative at Mozilla</a>, which targeted just that need of improving access for the web layer. Since then I’ve written a number of articles about various APIs and our dedication to standardize these – because if we only did it for us, we wouldn’t do the best for the Open Web.</p>
<p>My most extensive post on APIs was <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/02/using-webapis-to-make-the-web-layer-more-capable/\">Using WebAPIs to make the web layer more capable</a>, which I believe is a good introduction to just how many things you can do from the web layer.</p>
<h3>Apps – what are they and do we need them?</h3>
<p>With Apple’s move with the App Store, <em>everyone</em> wanted to create their own store, where they had complete control, their own APIs and with the goal of making a lot of money. Which is fair, they are businesses and they protect their interests.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe the web and just using URLs to get something is the most powerful thing we have, and something we should cherish and protect for the future. And then if you need a shortcut (bookmarks, anyone?) you can add a web page/URL to your home screen and that’s it.</p>
<p>Users will gain from this and developers will need to build with one technology – the web – instead of having a separate team for each mobile platform. With Firefox OS, the goal has not been to have developers learn something from scratch, but rather utilize and reuse heir existing Open Web technologies.</p>
<p>Since user’s have gotten so used to apps, we are offering that possibility in Firefox OS as well, but have made sure that it’s based on the Open Web (I’ve written more in detail about this in <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/02/getting-started-with-open-web-apps-why-and-how/\">Getting started with Open Web Apps – why and how</a>).</p>
<p>We also have a <a href=\"https://marketplace.firefox.com/\">Firefox Marketplace</a> where you can submit your apps, for findability, payments and more. What’s crucial to know here, though is that you don’t have to build an app if you don’t want to, you don’t have to use the Marketplace – apps are installable from anywhere. Over time, we hope that other people can create their own dedicated Marketplaces as well, for certain topics or local interests.</p>
<p>You could just as well continue to build your own mobile HTML5 web site – with Responsive Design, of course – and you will be good to go on Firefox OS. I see apps an optional approach, not the one and only. The choice is <em>yours</em>.</p>
<h4>Finding mobile web sites that are only on the web</h4>
<p>Also, for users, if you swipe to the left from the home screen in Firefox OS, you will get to the <a href=\"http://blog.everything.me/2013/02/25/exciting-times-at-everything-me/\">integrated Everything.me service</a> – finding mobile web sites out there that you can test first, and then pin to your home screen if you want to.</p>
<h3>Along came Web Activities</h3>
<p>With above mentioned WebAPIs, there are some things on a mobile that are to sensitive to expose and give complete access to, like telephony or SMS. But, naturally there are use cases where you’d want to trigger and interact with them from your content or app. Therefore, we <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/01/introducing-web-activities/\">introduced Web Activities</a>, which gives you a simple and powerful way to do just that, and with a connected user experience and approval.</p>
<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://robertnyman.com/images/1307/Web-Activities.png\" /></p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>It has also been interesting to see how tools and options have developed, to test this open platform in a simple and lightweight manner. I’m tremendously grateful for the work by Myk Melez and others on the <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/firefox-os-simulator-3-0-released/\">Firefox OS Simulator</a>, and I’ve happy to have been able to help developers by creating the <a href=\"https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App\">Firefox OS Boilerplate App</a> – all based on developers’ needs and input.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App-new-UI.png\" /></a></p>
<h3>When it took off</h3>
<p>When it really got exciting, and things started to take off, was about six months after the initial announcement. It was time for the massive <a href=\"http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/\">Mobile World Conference</a> in Barcelona, <em>the</em> place to be at if you were doing something in the mobile sector.</p>
<p>I watched it from afar, and tried to assist the announcements and attention with writing about it in <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/mozillas-boot-to-gecko-the-web-is-the-platform/\">Mozilla’s Boot to Gecko – The Web is the Platform</a> and <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/gaia-mozillas-user-interface-for-boot-to-gecko-all-web-technologies/\">Gaia, Mozilla’s user interface for Boot to Gecko – all web technologies</a>. It gained an enormous interest and from then, it has been busy days.</p>
<h3>Mobile World Conference, anno 2013</h3>
<p>This year I decided to go to Mobile World Congress, I had to be a part of what was going on. And it was such a wonderful and extremely intense experience! Working from early morning till <em>late</em> nights, talking, learning, sharing. It was wonderful to see all the interest and hope around Firefox OS, something that I believe must be somewhat akin to the 1.0 release of Firefox. How can we create something open and make a difference?</p>

<h3>Today’s the day</h3>
<p>Yesterday <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/07/01/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">we announced that the first Firefox OS devices are coming into the market</a>, and today the very first devices will be available for sale in Madrid, Spain. There are a number of other countries and places to be announced in the very near future, and with a lot of hardware and operator partners, this is so exciting!</p>
<p>There has been so much hard work by so many people going into this: to make it work, to get through the hard times, to seal the the deals, to understand, educate and inspire developers. A lot of effort has gone into this, but for me, I don’t regret one second. And <strong>thank you</strong> to eveyone for all your contributions to this project!</p>
<p>I was there day one. I was along for the entire ride, from the first code commit to seeing the actual devices being launched, to people owning them. It has been a magic experience, and frankly, I’m a bit touched. Within one’s career, I don’t believe many get the chances to be there from the initial spark to the the launch of a completely new mobile operating system.</p>
<p>And this is not the end. It has just begun.</p>

I figured it was about time I'd update people reading along with some of the stuff that I've been working on lately(of course with the help of the rest of the Graphics team and others!). I will be using the term Moz2D in this post to refer to our new graphics API that was formerly known under the name 'Azure'.</p>
<p><strong>Moz2D Stand-Alone Build & Repository</strong></p>
<p>In order to make it easier for both ourselves, partners and potential 3rd parties interested in using Moz2D to build and work with the Moz2D API, I now have a stand-alone repository that contains the Moz2D basic library code, the player and some testing applications. The exact status of this repository is still to be determined, and no automation is applied to it yet, however we are making sure it keeps building and remains up to date! It can be found <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/users/bschouten_mozilla.com/moz2d/\">here</a>. Some basic build instructions are available <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX#Testing.2C_replaying.2C_building_Moz2D\">here</a>, I will try to post more detailed build information, also for the different dependencies such as Cairo and Skia, somewhere in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Direct2D 1.1 Integration</strong></p>
<p>We've been working towards a Direct2D 1.1 backend in Moz2D. Direct2D 1.1 was included with Windows 8 and is provided as an update to Windows 7 users. It includes a wide range of API additions, several of which give us the ability to implement the Moz2D feature set with reduced and cleaner code. In addition to that some of the API additions should promise some performance improvements. We have refrained from using some of the new APIs in the Direct2D 1.1 implementation as of yet however, since at the moment they seem to increase the complexity without offering the expected performance benefits. As we begin rolling out Direct2D 1.1 integration to actual firefox users I'll attempt to provide more information on what we discover along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Moz2D Recording & Performance Analysis Improvements</strong></p>
<p>Another thing that we've been working on has been increased recording abilities as well as an increased ability to get useful information out of these recordings. Although the priority for this has been relatively low, steady improvements are being made and it has proven to be a large asset in the creation of new Moz2D backends.</p>
<p>First of all it's now possible to create a recording of a specific page using a single command when using Firefox nightly, an example looks like this (assuming 'recording' is a valid, clean profile of firefox):</p>
<blockquote><p>firefox -no-remote -P recording -recording file://C:\\Users\\Bas\\Dev\\mytest.html -recording-output mytest.aer</p></blockquote>
<p>We're currently still working out some problems which will often cause recordings to be terminated prematurely and therefore come up empty. But this should be fairly easy to fix. Do note this needs to be done on a system where Moz2D content is enabled, for now, this is only windows, although it should soon include OS X as well!</p>
<p>Once the recording is completed several (experimental) possibilities have been added. First of all the Moz2D player has gotten additional features, see a screenshot below for the updated look:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.basschouten.com/media/blogs/blog/azure/player2dscr.png\"><img alt=\"Player2D Screenshot\" src=\"http://www.basschouten.com/media/blogs/blog/azure/player2dscr.png\" title=\"Player 2D (click for a larger version!)\" width=\"450\" /><br />Click for a larger version</a></p>
<p>Note that it's now possible to replay the recording with different drawing backends (depending on your build). This easily makes it possible when adding backends to find flaws in new implementations by comparing drawing results with established backends. We've also added the possibility to analyze timings on a per-call basis to find performance bottlenecks for different backends. In addition to that a separate application called 'recordbench' has been added which is in a very early stage, this essentially is a very simple tool that reports timings for a recording across a range of backends. Trough this application we should be able to do automated performance comparisons between different drawing backends.</p>
<p>Finally we've added a micro-benchmark suite that allows us to make detailed performance comparisons on a per-backend basis. The intention of all this being to give us the ability to make well-informed decisions in the future as to what drawing backends to prefer on specific platforms/configurations.</p>
<p>This isn't necessarily all that we've been doing and I'll do my best to provide additional updates in the near future!</p><div class=\"item_footer\"><p><small><a href=\"http://www.basschouten.com/blog1.php/progress-on-moz2d\">Original post</a> blogged on <a href=\"http://b2evolution.net/\">b2evolution</a>.</small></p></div>" nil nil "7ced3f41703bfcbf62bbda6edb03e104") (267 (20949 15560 837864) "http://oduinn.com/blog/2013/07/02/triumph-tr3-in-san-francisco/" "John O'Duinn: Triumph TR3 in San Francisco" "John" "Tue, 02 Jul 2013 07:53:48 +0000" "<p>Walking to a neighborhood coffeeshop, I found this immaculate Triumph TR3 parked on a side street near my house.</p>

The performance team also joined us as there are various joint projects between our teams. After the week is over it’s interesting to look back and see what was accomplished during the week and what it opened as guidance for our future work. Here is my personal recap, some of the highlights of what I did and what I saw during the week. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally met with Irving, with whom I’ve been working in the past few months in our project to move the Add-ons Manager storage from SQLite to JSON and making it off-main-thread (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853389\">bug 853389</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853388\">bug 853388</a>)</li>
<li>We did a triage of performance-related bugs to classify them into high impact and low impact and figure out where to focus</li>
<li>Got to see some of the great progress that Tim Taubert and Avi has done on the tabstrip animations and got Tim to help me use the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=453650\">reflow observers</a> to do some experiments of my own in the UI. I didn’t find any obvious low hanging fruits, which is expected since he has fixed various offenders since introducing these reflows observers, but the attempt was worthwhile</li>
<li>Using the profiler I noticed some long stacks for text reflowing during tab animations, but these didn’t translate into any measurable slowness. In any case, I started some hacking to see if it was possible to improve it anyway. The issue is that the title in a tab has to be constantly remeasured for cropping while a tab opening animation is happening. I wrote a patch to only display the tab title and favicon after the animation has completed, and then got together with Avi to run his tab animation FPS tests and see what changes. The answer was: not much, there were no visible gains. In hindsight, there’s an obvious reason: even though we can hide the text in the tab that is opening, we can’t do it for the other open tabs, which will all be potentially shrinking and re-cropping at the same time. However, the investigation was very useful nonetheless, because we discovered two issues with the APIs used to measure the FPS on Mac: a telemetry measurement have been inactive since OMTC has been activated; and the framerate was always stuck on vsynced even with different values for layout.frame_rate (which is useful to tweak when doing animation stress tests)</li>
<li>Got together with Paolo to discuss the plans and current state of the Downloads API off-main-thread project, which I’ll be joining to help (starting with <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=852482\">bug 852482</a>)</li>
<li>Watched Vladan present his findings about <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/vdjeric/2013/05/01/running-nightly-23-from-an-sd-card/\">running Firefox on an SD card</a>. I had already seem the video through his blog post but watching it again and going into more details was very interesting, as the extreme slow disk IO is not only an artificial case produced on SD cards, but also something that many users have to face daily on machines with older hard drives and anti-virus software than can significantly worsen the problems.</li>
<li>Vladan’s talk was also of particular interest to me as it serves as motivation and validation for the work I’ve been involved with in the last significant number of months: the Add-ons Manager work and now the Downloads API.</li>
<li>And various converstations about <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis\">Electrolysis</a>, including a good talk with Yoric to understand how the ongoing work on session restore and e10s will interact</li>
</ul>
<p>And beyond that there were also various other topics that benefited from having the team all together in one place, specially Social API and Australis. To me personally the week was immensely helpful as a motivator and as a way to get consensus and clarity into our upcoming projects, not to mention the fine chance of directly interacting with the entire team which not often happens as we’re all spread around the around!</p>
<p>As a side note, this blog post was an exercise in itself as one of the outcomes for me from the Summit Assembly meeeting we had at the week before. There’s more on it that needs a separate blog post to explain, but a personal action that I’ve taken from that event is to increase the transparency and involvement with the community about the work I do.</p>

<p>I just switched from an Android phablet made by Samsung, device I came to hate for many reasons, to a Firefox OS Geeksphone Keon. That was my second Android phone, I switched because I got it for free<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/pnote-839-1\" id=\"rev-pnote-839-1\">1</a>]</sup>, needed a carrier that worked better than the failure that is WIND Mobile on which I was using my Nexus One<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/pnote-839-2\" id=\"rev-pnote-839-2\">2</a>]</sup> and said Nexus One was just abandoned in OS upgrade by HTC AND Google after 22 month. I have to admit I missed the Nexus One, still, as Samsung didn't make Android better, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Back to the point. I got that Geeksphone Keon, provided by my employer: Mozilla.</p>
<p>This is not a review of the phone, BTW, and all of this also applies to the <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/07/01/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">just released Firefox OS phone in Spain</a>.</p>
<p>On my Android phablet<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/pnote-839-3\" id=\"rev-pnote-839-3\">3</a>]</sup> I used 4 applications: the web browser, a twitter client (not Twitter's own though), Instagram and Foursquare.</p>
<p>On my Firefox OS phone, I had to scrap the last two. Why? Because despite requiring an internet connection and having some sort of web interface, their are unusable on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Web browser</strong></p>
<p>On Android I used Firefox for Android as my web browser. It is currently the best solution for web browsing is designed to protect your privacy and to run on more devices than Google's own Chrome. Call me biased if you want but truth is I have been using Firefox on the desktop too.</p>
<p>Firefox OS web browser is basically the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong></p>
<p>Twitter is a bit hurtfull. It is designed from the ground up to be used as a web application. Twitter has a mobile version that is meant to work well on small screen. They even have a packaged version for the Firefox OS Marketplace. Where it hurts is that Twitter web UI remains awful, either deliberately (given that the iOS client is awfull too) or because we got spoiled by third-party clients. On Android I was using Twicca (no source code) or Twidere (broke a bit at one point), but it should be noted that Twitter gave the finger to third parties when they added restriction on the development of client ; as well as bickering with Instagram to not show their content inline.</p>
<p>They get almost full marks for being a web app and treating it as first class.</p>
<p><strong>Foursquare</strong></p>
<p>On the desktop, if you go to Foursquare you get a decent web application, albeit you can do the major feature that Foursquare calls for: check-in.</p>
<p>On mobile, if I visit the website on Firefox for Android I get prompted to download an app.</p>
<p>On Firefox OS it is worse. Looks like their detection fail and they offer the desktop website that is mostly unusable on such a small screen. I filed <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=878132\">bug 878132</a> for our tech evangelism to eventually have a look at.</p>
<p>Seems like they didn't go all the way to make it relevant on mobile web. Sadly. What was an experiment I started by the end of last year when I signed up for the service stopped here right at Firefox OS. It seems that I don't need it. They lost a user.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong></p>
<p>This one is the worst of the worst. First and foremost their web interface for desktop is very limited. Secondly, it doesn't scale at all on mobile - some content scale better than other. Third, they bickered with Twitter so that their content is not viewable inline.</p>
<p>Why does that last one matter? Try viewing the instagram content in the Twitter mobile web client.</p>
<p>I give a F as a mark.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Simply make your mobile app web based. It will run on iOS, Android, Firefox OS, Blackberry, etc. and people will be able to follow when they change phone and you won't need to spend a lot of resources for each platforms.</p>
<p>Also if you really want to have a packaged app, remember there are technologies like <a href=\"http://phonegap.com/\">PhoneGap</a> whose purpose is exactly that.</p>

The Learning team has been reorganised (twice!) so I’m now on the Badges Team v2.0. Things certainly don’t move slowly in the tech world.</p>

<p>Initially, I planned for this post to include an epic infographic showing all of the places I’ve been, the people I’ve talked to, and so on. But that task would take a whole day of my time – and that’s time I haven’t got! Working at Mozilla is exciting, but busy. Suffice to say that <strong>I’ve attended 53 events in the 52 weeks I’ve been at Mozilla</strong> and I’ve usually been speaking at or running workshops at them. When you factor in Christmas shutdown at PTO (a.k.a. holiday) then that’s pretty impressive/scary.</p>
<p>I’ve been many places this past year evangelising Mozilla’s mission and, in particular, the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI). I’ve been to Canada (twice), several places in the US, the Netherlands (twice), Belgium, Portugal, Ireland, all over the UK… the list goes on. That sounds great but, as any business traveller will tell you, you don’t usually get to do the touristy things; most of what you see is the inside of airports, hotels, planes, trains and automobiles. Having said that, it beats sitting at the same desk day-in, day-out. <img alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> </p>

<p>I’m often asked what it’s like to work for Mozilla. As people ask that question their eyes often light up as if it’s a magic wonderland. It’s <em>not</em> unicorns and rainbows all the time and I certainly recognise the ‘inability to switch off’ problem that Rob Hawkes mentioned in his post upon <a href=\"http://rawkes.com/articles/on-leaving-mozilla\">leaving Mozilla</a>. In that post he talked about stress and burnout as well. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it) I experienced stress, burnout and working crazy hours as a teacher and senior leader while still in my 20′s. That means both I and my family are well-equipped to spot and deal with the tell-tale signs of stress. I know when to rest and how to look after myself these days.</p>
<p>But working at Mozilla is, if not a magic wonderland, certainly <em>different </em>and<em> pretty awesome</em>. I’ve never experienced such freedom and devolved responsibility as I do here. Nor have I ever worked with people who are so talented, motivated and great at communicating using technology. It’s also wonderful knowing that you’re playing a part in making a difference on a global scale. <em>Especially</em> with the work that I’m involved in around <a href=\"http://openbadges.org\">Open Badges</a> and the <a href=\"http://mzl.la/weblitstd\">Web Literacy Standard</a> I feel like this is stuff that could significantly improve the educational and career opportunities of the next generation. Given that’s my children’s generation, it makes me proud to work for a global non-profit where <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/\">doing good is part of our code</a>.</p>

When enterprises (and others) are customizing Firefox, I get asked pretty much the same questions every time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I disable private browsing?</li>
<li>How do I turn off Firefox Sync?</li>
<li>How do I prevent access to about:config?</li>
<li>How do I prevent the installation of add-ons?</li>
<li>How do I prevent access to the add-ons manager?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Doing any of these things properly is actually quite difficult, because none of the people that developed these features ever thought that someone would want to disable them. I think the primary reason for this is that most people that create software have only ever experienced how one type of person uses a computer. They believe that everyone uses a computer like they do; they have full access to the computer, they can do whatever they want and they can customize the computer however they want. This narrow view causes them to create software for people like them.
</p>
<p>
The reality is that people use computers in many different ways. In many industries, organizations, governments and educational institutions, there is a need to prevent people from having too much access to the computer and the browser. And it's not just things like kiosks. It could be shared computers at a hospital or bank, or it could be simply that the employees are not very computer literate and you want to make sure they have limited access. Or maybe the browser is used on a piece of equipment and you want to make sure it can't be messed with. There are tons of reasons why someone would want to disable certain features.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you create a new feature, you should ask yourself this questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there a good reason why someone would want to disable this feature?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is yes, you should provide a single global preference that removes the entire feature. You should also ensure that when this preference is locked, any associated UI associated with that feature is disabled.
</p>
<p>
Asking this simple question before implementing a new feature will go a long way towards making sure Firefox is enterprise ready.</p>" nil nil "568dfdcf857b45149ebc48f1afda8c0a") (259 (20949 15560 830481) "https://brendaneich.com/2013/07/firefox-os-launches/" "Brendan Eich: Firefox OS Launches" "Brendan Eich" "Mon, 01 Jul 2013 14:56:48 +0000" "<p>Just under two years ago, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/dmip1GpD5II/CzJSSUMq5HsJ\">we started</a> <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/os/\">Firefox OS</a> as the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G\">Boot to Gecko (B2G)</a> project, with little more than a belief that the Web should be the only platform you need to build an open mobile device ecosystem.

<p>Not only is the price very competitive, you <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu8q-oISbas\">get a great phone for that</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve said this many times before, but let me now here repeat the things that really get me excited like a 5 year old on sugar rush about Firefox OS:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Firefox OS kills the idea of mobile web connectivity only being for the rich in the western world.</strong> Yes, for us in the US or the UK having a new shiny phone every half year is not an issue as companies are killing each other trying to underbid the price and offers of the others. But a usable Android that is not generations behind and hard-wired to a terrible stock browser or an iPhone is just not affordable to everyone. Even worse, if you have no credit card you couldn’t even buy apps for them. This is unfair, elitist and plainly against anything the web stands for. FirefoxOS is affordable, and apps can be bought on prepay or on your phone bill and the OS is the browser which means updates are easy</li><li><strong>FirefoxOS does not assume a fast, stable and always available connection</strong>. When traveling I start hating my Android phone which I love to bits otherwise. Having dozens of megabyte updates over roaming is out of the question and neither is using flaky and slow wireless connections. Firefox OS has no native apps – all of them, including the system apps are written in <span class=\"caps\">HTML</span>, CSS and JavaScript. Thus they are much smaller and can have atomic updates instead of having to be replaced as a unit every single time.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS is the web in your pocket.</strong> It is Firefox and nothing else (other than a Linux core to access the hardware). Thus I will not be told to “download the native app” when I go to web sites that are perfectly fine to use.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS is the platform <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> deserves</strong> For developers, our <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> solutions are finally first-class citizens. We are not shoved into a slower web view and told we can not access the hardware.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS apps are web distributed apps.</strong> Users can go to the marketplace and find our apps by hand or via review or they could search for a certain song, movie, football team and dish and find our app that way. App discovery is as simple as using the web and finding web sites. Instead of having to pay as a developer and be at the mercy of the T&C of closed marketplaces I can publish a Firefox OS app by adding a button and calling the open web apps <span class=\"caps\">API</span>. That way my current web site is the ad for my app and all my visitors potential app users.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>All of this is obvious to me as a geek but doesn’t mean anything if we don’t get devices in the hands of end users. And this is what happens now – big time! Alcatel, <span class=\"caps\">ZTE</span>, Telefonica, Deutsche Telekom, Spain and Poland. The fox really is out of the bag now. And oh how it will roam and run into many other directions. Be part of this, as a web developer, it is the most rewarding platform that will not change from under you at the whim of company goals or shareholder demands.</p>" nil nil "70733f89d35c71d5b4faa8472167d364") (257 (20949 15560 829198) "https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2013/07/01/success-and-firefox-os/" "Mitchell Baker: Success and Firefox OS" "mitchell" "Mon, 01 Jul 2013 11:49:46 +0000" "<p>Firefox OS is <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/07/01/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">launching today</a>.  With that in mind, it’s a good time to recap why Mozilla builds products, what our products represent and how our products relate to our goals.</p>
<p>Mozilla’s goal is to build openness, innovation, and opportunity into online life.   One of our biggest levers is of course building products.   We build products that provide a great user experience and engender openness, innovation and opportunity into the technology of the Web itself.</p>
<p>Firefox has done this in many ways.  Firefox was a pioneer in the world of open source consumer products, in open techniques for feedback, support, and quality, just to name a few examples.  We have always built Firefox to give developers huge opportunities for innovation in areas they care about.  We do not seek to control the ways developers can innovate, or the way people take control of their software.</p>
<p>As a result, Firefox helped usher in a whole new era of Web computing, bringing new experiences for users and new freedoms for developers.  Today Firefox continues to pioneer new technologies and features that benefit users.  Some recent examples include features such as Do Not Track, which allows people to tell websites they do not wish to be tracked around the Web, and our Social API that makes the browsing experience more personal and customizable.</p>
<p>With Firefox OS we hope to do something similar with the mobile computing environment.  We want to bring the power of the open Web to this world.  We want to bring the same kinds of flexibility, opportunity and freedom to this computing environment that the original Firefox brings to the desktop.  More specifically, we want  Firefox OS to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prove that the Web is the platform, surprise people with what HTML5 is capable of on mobile devices.</li>
<li>Advance adoption of mobile Web standards and APIs across the industry, including on other operating systems.</li>
<li>Spur developer innovation; break the mold of what a mobile app is capable of.</li>
<li>Make the open Web accessible to more people.</li>
<li>Spur competition in making the Web the platform for mobile computing.</li>
<li>Excite people.</li>
<li>Provide a powerful, exciting and open alternative to the current closed ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll note that I haven’t included something like “we want to ship X numbers of phones.”  Ultimately, we want enough people choosing Firefox OS to confirm we’ve built a great product and to move us toward  a more open mobile computing platform based on the Web.    Our goal is to provide an alternative that has a deep and exciting user experience based on openness, choice and competition.</p>" nil nil "1134628c3ae09e24a50dd206782c6061") (256 (20949 15560 828638) "http://mcc.id.au/blog/2013/07/firefox-svg-text-improvements" "Cameron McCormack: Improved SVG text support in Firefox Nightly" "Cameron McCormack" "Mon, 01 Jul 2013 08:48:19 +0000" "<p>On the weekend, I landed the final patch in what turned out to be quite a long running project to overhaul Firefox’s SVG text support to reuse the same text layout and rendering code that it uses for HTML.

<li>The ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space\">white-space</a>’ property now applies to SVG text.  In the future, in SVG 2, ‘white-space’ will be recommended method to control white space handling rather than <code>xml:space=\"\"</code>.  ‘white-space’ can be used to render manually wrapped text when using the <code>pre</code> and <code>pre-line</code> values.  ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height\">line-height</a>’ is used to determine the spacing between lines.</li>

The data collected was largely what we call <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis\">traffic analysis</a></em> data: who talked to whom, where, when, using what mechanism.  It was mostly <em>not</em> the actual contents of the conversations, but so much can be deduced from “who talked to whom, when” that this should not reassure you in the slightest.  If you haven’t seen the demonstration that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/06/prism_metadata_analysis_paul_revere_identified_by_his_connections_to_other.single.html\">just by compiling and correlating membership lists, the British government could have known that Paul Revere would’ve been a good person to ask pointed questions about revolutionary plots in the colonies in 1772</a>, go read that now.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s safe to assume we know <em>anything</em> about the <em>details</em> of this data collection: especially not the degree of cooperation the government obtained from telcos and other private organizations.  There are too many layers of secrecy involved, there’s probably no one who has the complete picture of what the various three-letter agencies were <em>supposed</em> to be doing (let alone what they actually <em>were</em> doing), and there’s too many people trying to bend the narrative in their own preferred direction.  However, I also don’t think the details matter all that much at this stage.  That the program existed, and was successful enough that the NSA was bragging about it in an internal PowerPoint deck, is enough for the immediate conversation to go forward.  (The details may become very important later, though: especially details about who got to make use of the data collected.)</p>
<p>Lots of other people have been writing about why this program is a Bad Thing: Most critically, large traffic-analytic databases are <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/174851/strange-case-barrett-brown#ixzz2X1oYM1xV\">easy to abuse for politically-motivated witch hunts</a>, which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover#Investigation_of_subversion_and_radicals\">can and have occurred in the US in the past</a>, and arguably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/26/nsa-revelations-response-to-smears\">are now occurring as a reaction to the leaks</a>.  One might also be concerned that this <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/06/preventing_cell.html\">makes it harder to pursue other security goals</a>; that it gives other countries an incentive to partition the Internet along national boundaries, <a href=\"http://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2013/06/provoking-national-boundaries-internet-chilling-thought\">harming its resilience</a>; or that it <a href=\"https://medium.com/surveillance-state/f77088fd4c28\">further harms the US’s image abroad</a>, which was already not doing that well; or that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/29/tomorrows-surveillance/\">the <em>next</em> surveillance program will be even worse if this one isn’t stopped</a>.
(Nothing new under the sun: Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis’ argument in “<a href=\"http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/Brandeisprivacy.htm\">The Right to Privacy</a>” in 1890 is still as good an explanation as any you’ll find of why the government should not spy on the general public.)</p>
<p>I want to talk about something a little different; I want to talk about why the <em>secrecy</em> of these ubiquitous surveillance programs is at least as harmful to good governance as the programs themselves.</p>

<h3>Secrecy culture</h3>
<p><a href=\"http://www.owlfolio.org/media/2013/06/loose-lips-sink-ships-posters2.jpg\"><img alt=\"World War II-era propaganda poster of sinking steamship with the words “Loose LIPS Sink Ships” superimposed.\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1514\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.owlfolio.org/media/2013/06/loose-lips-sink-ships-posters2-196x300.jpg\" width=\"196\" /></a></p>
<p>If you’ve had any exposure at all to the US military-industrial complex, you will have noticed two things: its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/jun/12/prism-nsa-powerpoint-graphic-design\">institutional idiom of horrible PowerPoint slide decks</a>, and its obsession with secrecy. No doubt this started with the entirely appropriate goal of <em>operational</em> secrecy: you don’t make it easy for the enemy to find and sink your troopships. But secrecy is contagious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you decide that something is so dangerous that the entire world
hinges on keeping it under control, this sense of fear and dread
starts to creep outwards. The worry about what must be controlled
becomes insatiable—and pretty soon the mundane is included with
the existential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so <a href=\"http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/2012/08/29/forbidden-spheres/\">all round objects become classified</a>. (quote is from linked article) This culture of secrecy is especially obvious where nuclear bombs are concerned, but it pervades every part of the complex, even to the groups and organizations that aren’t doing anything that’s formally secret. The default action is not to talk, and the default policy is to lock up the files. Publishing one’s research is an unusual action that must be justified and approved. Going on public record about an agency’s plans and activities is positively aberrant. I think this is why the US government collectively, quite a few officials personally, an awful lot of reporters in <a href=\"http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/yearning-to-be-subjects-journalist.html\">the “establishment” news media</a>,  and <a href=\"http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2013/06/one-of-things-i-find-most-fascinating.html\">a truly depressing number of private citizens</a>, have been acting as if <em>reporting that spying is going on</em> is far, far worse than the spying itself. In the mind of someone invested in secrecy culture, leaking a secret is worse than anything. It <em>isn’t done</em>.  And what with the military-industrial complex being the single largest employer in the country, and its attitudes trickling down to state and local government as well, it wouldn’t surprise me if nearly every citizen has had <em>some</em> contact with secrecy culture.</p>
<p>This hit me personally last weekend. I was at my grandmother’s 90th birthday party and one of my relatives wanted to know what I thought of the news. The conversation went around in circles for a while because we were both agreeing with each other that we were disgusted that such a thing could happen, but it turned out that <em>I</em> was disgusted by the spying and <em>he</em> was disgusted by the government’s failure to keep the spying secret.  Once this became clear, I said to him that I didn’t think the spying should have been secret in the first place, and that made so little sense to him that it ended the conversation.</p>
<h3>Kerckhoffs’ Principle</h3>
<p>The thing is, too much secrecy turns out to be self-defeating. This is well-understood in cryptography; it is the famous principle proposed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Kerckhoffs\">Auguste Kerckhoffs</a> in 1883:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The system [that is, the algorithm for encrypting messages] must not
be required to be secret. It must be able to fall into the hands of
the enemy without  inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is counterintuitive. Why <em>wouldn’t</em> you conceal your encryption algorithm from the enemy? Indeed, even though Kerckhoffs wrote in 1883, up till about 1977 everyone did just that, believing that it couldn’t <em>hurt</em>. And some people, not to mention some major industrial standards organizations who ought to know better, still do. Unfortunately, it turns out that it <em>does</em> hurt.  Cryptographic algorithms are difficult to design, and unforgiving of errors.  A design that hasn’t been vetted by lots of people is almost surely flawed.  If you publish an algorithm and invite feedback, you attract attention from many more cryptographers than you could hope to employ internally, and they’ll tell you when they find a problem.  Meantime, <em>whether or not</em> you publish an algorithm, the odds are that the enemy will find out how it works.  But when <em>they</em> find a flaw, they won’t tell you about it; they’ll just <em>use</em> it to read your messages. If you’re very lucky, before this happens, someone relatively well-disposed to you will discover your secret algorithm, find the flaws, and <a href=\"http://www.owlfolio.org/research/the-conference-formerly-known-as-oakland-day-1/#dont-trust-satellite-phones\">tell you about it in a highly public and embarrassing manner</a>.</p>
<p>But Kerckhoffs’ Principle is not just for cryptographic primitives.  It applies to network protocol design, which is very nearly as unforgiving, and not as codified: nowadays security analysts are far more likely to find a mistake in the way a protocol <em>uses</em> a cipher than to break the cipher itself.  It also applies to software in general: there’s a <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceschneier/2012/05/30/the-vulnerabilities-market-and-the-future-of-security/\">black market for “zero-day exploits”</a> (that is, not-yet-fixed security-critical bugs) in both open- and closed-source software, but open-source software attracts more attention from people who would rather see the bugs fixed, because open source (as a social phenomenon) is more inviting of experimentation and feedback.</p>
<p>We can generalize even further, past computer ’ware to other complex systems: such as nation-states and their governments.  The logic of Kerckhoff’s principle predicts that when a political decision <em>isn’t</em> made in public with full knowledge of the situation, it will be more likely to be a bad decision, specifically a decision which can be exploited.  Yet that is precisely the sort of decision making that secrecy culture demands.
If the NSA’s blanket surveillance programs had been public knowledge from the get-go, we could have <a href=\"https://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/06/13/3-questions-about-nsa-surveillance/\">asked pointed questions</a>, starting with “Is this worth the sacrifice of civil liberties?” but also including things like “Does this actually <em>work</em> against criminals who know their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradecraft\">tradecraft</a>?” and “You want <em>how much</em> money?” and of course “That wouldn’t happen to be your father’s brother’s nephew’s cousin’s former roommate’s defense contracting firm you’re proposing to hire, would it now?”</p>
<p>But they weren’t, and we didn’t, and oddly enough, it seems that we have spent <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_12744661\">billions of dollars</a> on a system which <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-23/u-s-surveillance-is-not-aimed-at-terrorists.html\"><em>doesn’t</em> work against competent criminals</a> but which invites <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/06/26/195045/memories-of-stasi-color-germans.html\">unflattering comparisons with the Stasi</a>.  Worse yet, the NSA’s surveillance programs look suspiciously like <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2013/06/07/u-s-never-really-ended-creepy-total-information-awareness-program/\">a continuation of the “Total Information Awareness” program that Congress axed in 2003</a>, which means the secrecy culture is prepared to <em>ignore</em> decisions by its elected overseers that don’t go its way, or twist arms behind the scenes till the decision is—secretly, of course—reversed.  At that point, can we call this a democracy anymore?</p>" nil nil "df036404e82b7c71398b4aecff668b4e") (253 (20949 15560 826118) "http://blog.mozilla.org/planet/2013/06/30/planet-additions-class-of-6302013/" "Planet Mozilla Blog: Planet Additions: Class Of 6/30/2013" "raccettura" "Sun, 30 Jun 2013 18:35:52 +0000" "<p><a href=\"http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/\">Michael Coates</a> (<a href=\"http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss\">feed</a>) – I currently have a <a href=\"http://michael-coates.blogspot.com/\">security blog</a> that is listed on planet based on my Mozilla tag.

On June 15th,  <a href=\"https://reps.mozilla.org/e/summit-planning-assembly/\">50 Mozillians</a> got together for a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/SummitPlanningAssembly\">planning session</a> and I discovered just how much Mozillians focus on getting great things done!</p>
<p>We met to help shape the Mozilla Summit (a 2,000 person conference happening later this year) in a way that would move Mozilla forward. We spent the first day talking about top issues and the second day planning out the topics and sessions.</p>

<p>Of all the trips I’ve taken this year, I think the Mozilla Summit Planning Assembly was the one I looked forward to most – a chance to help shape the future of Mozilla and have great conversations with people who are passionate about the same things I am! I also admit I was really worried that we were too big of a group to get anything done. Turns out I was not alone. We all showed up ready to set the content and agenda for the Mozilla Summit.</p>
<p><strong>A day of tough discussions and building trust</strong></p>
<p>We had some excellent conversations Friday night and Saturday. We did a number of different exercises designed to start conversations and pull out key themes. For example, we started out  Saturday with an “unpanel”. Four people sit in the middle of the group. They have a conversation. There’s an empty chair as well and whenever someone in the audience wants to join the conversation, they slide into the empty seat and one of the four sitting there self selects to go back to the bigger circle leaving an empty chair as an invitation for the next person. While at first it didn’t seem very different than a big group conversation where you passed around the mic, it turned out to be a great way to keep the audience engaged in the conversation. Every one was listening hard. The topics we covered were varied but a lot of it centered around non paid staff vs paid staff relationships – culture and responsibilities. We also talked about things like whether there’d be technical roadmap decisions made at the Summit, how people like to communicate, etc. One of the key takeaways for many of us was that we were all worried about similar issues!</p>
<p>Over the course of the day, <strong>two themes arose</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><strong>Old timers and new hires are having a hard time trusting each other at Mozilla.</strong> I’m sure I didn’t get all the nuances but it felt to me like old timers think new hires might not have the “Mozilla DNA” and might not have an appreciation for our mission and open source methods. And new hires think old timers are stuck and so concerned with consensus they aren’t always getting things done.  Over the weekend, I think we made great progress in killing that stereotype and building good relationships that bridge the gap. (<a href=\"http://lukasblakk.com/my-big-shift/\">Lukas Blakk wrote</a> about this experience as well.) I have to admit that personally I’m not sure where I fell on this stereotype other than feeling rather annoyed at both groups and some how personally responsible for both stereotypes. As a hiring manager, I’ve hired many of those new people. As a long time open source community member, I feel like it’s my job to make sure the “open source” way is considered and well represented.  I also think that part of the problem is how members of each group introduce themselves and represent themselves to the world – more on that later.</span></li>
<li><strong>Mozillians like to get stuff done!</strong> By the end of the day, we were all extremely uncomfortable with all of the discussions, panels and world cafe exercises with no clear idea of how it was going to produce an agenda for the Summit. Luckily our leaders and the Unconference organizers heard all of our concerns and when we turned up the second day, we got to create a rough outline of an agenda and topics for the Summit!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Getting down to work</strong></p>
<p>On the second day we did a “World Cafe” exercise. We had about 7 rooms and 3 time slots and everyone wrote in the topic they wanted to cover in one of the slots. We then did some consolidation and managed to squeeze everything into the ~20 slots.</p>
<p>The idea was to cover themes or topics we thought should be covered at the Mozilla Summit. Each session was to identify Session Title, Goals and Outcomes, People for Followup and What has to happen between now and the Summit. They were all captured in etherpads.</p>
<p>All the sessions I went to had great conversation. It was rather tricky to focus on how that topic would be covered at the Summit instead of just discussing the topic. We tried to focus on how the conversation would best happen at the Summit: what type of presentation it would be, how much should be a proposal vs a discussion, if it was one presentation or a theme, etc. Some times the topic you signed up for was not the topic your group ended up proposing. I attended discussions on communication, diversity (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mozdino\">Dino</a> and <a href=\"http://lukasblakk.com/\">Lukas</a> have a great diagram for a starting conversation!) and helping companies that aren’t used to “open” work with effectively with us.</p>
<p>Then <a href=\"https://commonspace.wordpress.com/\">Mark</a>, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/debbiecohen\">Debbie</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\">Mitchell</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/krnasz\">Kate</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2013/06/20/what-is-was/\">Mardi</a> grouped all of the topics into themes – interestingly “People” had the most topics. Other themes included Strategy, Product, Process and Purpose.</p>
<p>So now we have themes for the Summit. And a lot of proposed topics.</p>
<p>I found it really valuable to spend this time as a group planning for a big event. When you are going to bring 2,000 people together (in groups of 600) I think it’s essential to spend some time uncovering what the real issues that we need to discuss are.</p>
<p><strong>My take aways:</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the bigger goal of planning the Summit, I took away a few more key things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s important to <strong>work together, preferably in person</strong>. We built a lot of trust over the weekend – trust that would have taken much more time to build during our regular day-to-day lives and over the internet. I hope we can take that experience and bring it to the Mozilla Summit.</li>
<li>Mentors. After a conversation with <a href=\"http://diary.braniecki.net/\">Gandalf</a>, I came away thinking part of the solution might be <strong>holding mentors more accountable</strong> and some how measuring their success over time. We also discussed short term mentorship projects too.</li>
<li>How you introduce your self matters. With a few exceptions, most of the <strong>volunteer Mozillians introduced themselves as being “a community member”</strong> or a “Rep”. Most of <strong>paid staff introduced themselves by their functional role</strong> or team, “Firefox for Android”. This is natural as while we all feel like part of the greater Mozilla community, paid staff has in general been hired to do a particular role. But I feel like it’s a big part of the disconnect.</li>
<li><strong>Lots of communication formats</strong> are needed. <a href=\"http://lawrencemandel.com/\">Lawrence Mandel</a> pointed out that not everyone does well speaking in front of large groups at conferences, so whatever format the Summit takes, it needs to enable lots of communication vehicles, meetings, parties, irc, etherpads, newsgroups, … a way for everyone to find enough of their comfort zone so that they can be comfortable enough to participate fully.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Mozilla Summit Planning Assembly was one of the trips I was most looking forward to attending this year and it lived up to my expectations! I’m very excited for the Summit now! (And for all the planning that still has to happen before then!)</p>

<a href=\"https://login.persona.org\">Persona</a> conversations. As part of an
<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/2013/Auth_Jam_Session\">Auth Jam session</a>, a few of us explored the idea of adding
non-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth\">OAuth</a>-based authentication mechanisms to
<a href=\"https://indieauth.com\">IndieAuth</a>.</p>
<p>While <a href=\"http://aaronparecki.com\">Aaron</a> and <a href=\"http://ozten.com\">Austin</a> got
<a href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth/commit/1e5581b2a91b4d455be1310f833026a8c343ec71\">SMS</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth/commit/2dd7d58e26b65af53ea0a3c8659e1779dcb7be41\">Persona</a> working as IndieAuth providers during one of the Sunday hack
sessions, I wanted to explore the idea of IndieAuth (an implementation of
<a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth\">RelMeAuth</a>) as a
<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona/Implementing_a_Persona_IdP\">Persona identity provider</a>.</p>
<h3>Using IndieAuth on any Persona-enabled site</h3>
<p>The goal of this effort was to allow Indie Web developers to use their
preferred email address with Persona and have IndieAuth authenticate them
using any supported IndieAuth provider (e.g. <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/implementing-sign-twitter\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://developer.github.com/guides/basics-of-authentication/\">Github</a>).</p>
<p>This work will help bridge the gap between these two projects and allow
IndieAuth developers to log into more website using their
<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/How_to_set_up_IndieAuth_on_your_own_domain\">hard-earned credentials</a>.</p>
<h3>User setup</h3>
<p>In order to take advantage of this, users have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Serve a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona/.well-known-browserid\">support document</a> on their <em>email</em> domain declaring
<code>indieauth.com</code> as the authority for their domain.</li>
<li>Include a <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me\"><code>rel=\"me\"</code></a> link for their preferred
email address on their <em>personal</em> domain.</li>
<li>Advertise their <em>personal</em> domain on their <em>email</em> domain via
<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-webfinger\">WebFinger</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, Aaron would use the following support document at
<code>https://parecki.com/.well-known/browserid</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{
\"authority\": \"indieauth.com\"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then he would ensure that there is a <code>rel=\"me\"</code> link on <code>aaronparecki.com</code>
pointing to his preferred email address, <code>aaron@parecki.com</code>:</p>
<pre><code><a href=\"mailto:aaron@parecki.com\" rel=\"me\">Email me</a>
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, because his <em>email</em> domain (<code>parecki.com</code>) is different from his
<em>personal</em> domain (<code>aaronparecki.com</code>), they would need to be linked
together via WebFinger. Thankfully, he found a clever way to do this with
<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/aaronpk/5846789\">a simple Apache rewrite rule and some static files</a>.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Aaron and I worked out the the details of how this will work and wrote a
<a href=\"https://github.com/fmarier/indieauth-personaidp-spec\">walkthrough</a> to illustrate it.</p>
<p>The gist of it is that Persona will ask IndieAuth to certify an email
address and IndieAuth will convert that email address to a personal domain
(using WebFinger) before authenticating the user with one of the IndieAuth
providers enabled on that domain.</p>" nil nil "cbe37fff75b24051a937fbe59a534eb2") (250 (20949 15560 820690) "http://informationisart.com/19" "=?utf-8?Q?Sta=C5=9B_Ma=C5=82olepszy=3A?= Frequently asked questions about L20n" nil "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 23:47:00 +0000" "<p>I'm typing this on a train from Poznań to Warsaw, on my way back from

a developer has ever shipped a multilingual product, or if an end-user has ever
seen anything similar to the image below, where all but one word of the message
was truncated to fit the screen (there's a good chance they have).</p>
<p class=\"noindent\">

</p>
<p>Another great way to better know your audience is to listen to questions.  Good
questions are a sign that the audience was able to relate to the problem L20n
is trying to solve.  (To see why the solution is compelling, one has to first
acknowledge the problem.)</p>
<p>I was really happy with the the questions I got after my talk at meet.js.  They
were insightful and inspiring and each one brought something more to the
conversation.  Below I try to recap my answers to recurring and common themes.</p>
<h3>Only localizers know what they need</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Do you expect localizers to have programming experience?</em></p>
<p>No.  We're realistic.  We expect localizers to be experts in localization, not
programming. We're not imposing any complex syntax nor require to write macros
and dict-like data structures.  We do give localizers the freedom to get as
complex as they need, when they need it.  After all, only the localizers know
what is it that they need, and L20n doesn't make any assumptions about the
language it's used to localize into.  It's grammar-agnostic to the extreme.</p>
<p>Fortunately, more often than not there is no need to get any more complex than
the baseline.  When it comes to simple cases, L20n is pleasantly simple :</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><identifier</span> <span class=\"s\">\"A translated value\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
<span class=\"nv\"><multiline</span> <span class=\"s\">\"\"\"</span>
<span class=\"s\">      Multiline strings are easy to read and edit </span>
<span class=\"s\">      thanks to the triple-quote syntax.</span>
<span class=\"s\">    \"\"\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Localizing Mozilla projects has taught us that as many as 90-95% of messages
found in the UI are simple key-value pairs that won't require any advanced
knowledge of L20n's features.</p>
<p>For instance, the <a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/blob/master/tools/perf/example.lol\">file that we use to measure the performance</a> of real-life
usage of L20n, consists of over 500 strings, only 4 of which <em>are not key-value
pairs</em>.  The file is based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/v1.0.1/apps/settings/locales/settings.en-US.properties\">localization file</a> of Firefox OS's largest
app, Settings.</p>
<p>So why develop L20n at all?  Because it's the remaining 5% that make or break
the UI of your app.  They're too important to ignore and they are responsible
for the experience of the user.</p>
<p>L20n was created to cater to these 5%, and admittedly, L20n examples can get
rather complex (see <a href=\"http://l20n.github.io/tinker/\">L20n Tinker</a> for an example).  We're trying to show off
advanced features to explain what's possible with the framework and how it
handles common challenges of the UI design.</p>
<p>The vast majority of languages and use cases probably won't even need them.<br />
L20n's motto say it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep simple things simple.  Make complex things possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Common helpers for each language</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Will there be plural macros built into L20n for each language?</em></p>
<p>We may consider adding common rules for all languages at some point in the
future, but for the 1.0 release we decided to keep the framework lean and leave
them out.</p>
<p>Instead, we're hoping that more experienced localizers, preferably with some
programming knowledge, will step in and create common L20n files to be included
by others in their own projects.  Such files would include commonly-used
helpers like plural macros, translations of the names of the months and the
days of the week, formal and informal greetings depending on the time of day
<em>et cetera</em>.</p>
<p>Consider the following L20n file, <code>common.lol</code>:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">     <span class=\"nv\"><plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$n</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">$n</span> <span class=\"nb\">== </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"nv\">?</span> <span class=\"s\">\"zero\"</span> <span class=\"err\">:</span>
<span class=\"nv\">$n</span> <span class=\"nb\">== </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"nv\">?</span> <span class=\"s\">\"one\"</span> <span class=\"err\">:</span>
<span class=\"s\">\"many\"</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nb\">> </span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You could use the above plural macro in another file by using L20n's handy <code>import</code>
statement.</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\">import</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"ss\">'common.lol</span><span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>
<span class=\"nv\"><unread</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$unreadMessages</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">zero</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"No unread messages.  Good job!\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">one</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"You have one unread message.\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*many</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"You have {{ $unreadMessages }} unread messages.\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Thanks to this approach, the localizer keeps the control over even such basic
features of the localization as the plural selector, which allows for great
flexibility (if needed).</p>
<p>We'd love to see such common files created organically by the community and
shared among localizers in a decentralized manner.</p>
<h3>Context data and for-loops</h3>
<p>Question: <em>If the context data is global, how do I built multi-item UIs?</em></p>
<p>The interface between L20n's context and the data that developer wants to
expose to it indeed makes the data available context-wide.  In other words, if
the developer defines the context data as follows:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"json language-json\">    <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nt\">\"currentUser\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nt\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Jane\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
<span class=\"nt\">\"gender\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"feminine\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…it will be available to the localizer as <code>$currentUser</code> and can be used in any
entity.  This is an important design concept of L20n which goes back to the
idea that only the localizers can know what they need to properly localize
a message in the UI.  English may not require the user's gender to build
grammatically-correct sentences, but other languages certainly do.</p>
<p>To achieve the same in other localization frameworks, the developer would need
to pass the <code>currentUser</code> object in every call the the framework, just in case
the requested string makes use of that information in some language.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you want to build the UI out of repeating blocks and
exposing data needed by each block would lead to naming conflicts.  In such
cases, you can pass data on a per-entity basis as a second argument to
<a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/tree/1.0.0b3#ctxgetid-string-ctxdata-object\"><code>Context::get</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/tree/1.0.0b3#ctxgetentityid-string-ctxdata-object\"><code>Context::getEntity</code></a>.  Consider the following JavaScript
code:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">    <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">l10n</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'ready'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// ... </span>
<span class=\"nx\">notifications</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">forEach</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">notification</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nx\">nodes</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">].</span><span class=\"nx\">textContent</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">l10n</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">get</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'notification'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// pass notification.fromUser as $fromUser to the requested entity</span>
<span class=\"nx\">fromUser</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">notification</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">fromUser</span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// ... </span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how the developer only asks for the value of the <code>notification</code> entity
and passes <code>notification.fromUser</code> as <code>$fromUser</code>.  Here's what the
corresponding L20n code could look like:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><notification</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants to add you as a friend\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or assuming <code>$fromUser</code> has a <code>gender</code> property:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><notification</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">$fromUser.gender</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants you to add her to your friends\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants you to add him to your friends\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants you to add them to your friends\"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It's still possible, of course, to use the context-wide <code>$currentUser</code> variable
in the translation.  In the following example in Polish, the \"wants you
to add\" part needs to be accorded with the gender of the recipient, so it makes
use of both <code>$fromUser</code> passed to it directly and <code>$currentUser</code> available
context-wide.</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><notification</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">$fromUser.gender</span>, <span class=\"nv\">$currentUser.gender</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodała ją do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodał ją do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce zostać twoją znajomą\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodał go do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodał go do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce zostać twoim znajomym\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce dodać cię do znajomych\"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>See how this example can progressively get more complex?  It's interesting to
realize that the <code>unknown</code> case for both genders is, in fact, enough to get the
message across in a gramatically correct sentence.  Using more advanced featurs
of L20n, however, allows us to create a much more user-friendly interface which
seamlessly adapts to the user's gender.  As <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_and_Ray_Eames\">Charles Eames</a> famously put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The details are not the details. They make the design.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>L20n is declarative</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Can L20n automatically create declensions of unknown nouns?</em></p>
<p>It's tempting to try to create a framework that—with enough rules codified in
it—would be able to automatically decline nouns or conjugate verbs.  This has
sadly proven to be extremely difficult a task in practice which has been
keeping linguists and programmers busy for years.  Natural languages have too
many rules, too many exceptions and are not context-free.  </p>
<p>I could imagine tools built into L20n that would help create heuristics for
grammatical inflection.  For instance, we could add a method to check if a word
or an <em>n</em>-tuple starts or ends with a given string of characters.  This would
likely lead, however, to localizations becoming state machines, <em>imperatively</em>
trying to guess the correct inflection.  Unfortunately, state machines don't
model the intricacies of natural languages well.</p>
<p>L20n takes a <em>declarative</em> approach to localization, working around grammar
when needed.  Looking at examples of L20n code, it's important to remember that
they are not trying to codify the entire logic of the language's grammar, but
instead, they aim at declaring possible messages that the user might see in the
interface.</p>
<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/preso/blob/master/meetjs-poznan-2013/miasta.l20n\">one of the examples</a> I demoed during my talk at meet.js, I built a local
entity to store declensions of common city names.  The entity only defined
a nominative and a locative as these were the only cases that mattered in the
use case.  Furthermore, even though the locative case in Polish works with such
prepositions as <em>in</em>, <em>inside</em>, <em>on</em>, <em>ontop</em> and <em>about</em>, the example only
made use of <em>in</em>.  I ended up declaring my own case which I dubbed
<em>locativeIn</em>, which included the preposition.  This allowed me to easily handle
exceptions where the Polish word for <em>in</em> changes slightly to make the whole
expression sound better (<em>w Warszawie</em>—in Warsaw, but <em>we Wrocławiu</em>—in
Wrocław).</p>
<h3>Redundant by design</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Do I need to repeat the entire sentence just to change one
preposition?</em></p>
<p>The last example that I showed was a tiny website that I created during one
coffee break that counted down days and hours to my vacation.  The <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/stasm/5893026\">L20n
resource file</a> for this example is just one macro and one string, and yet
it's 34 lines long.  We designed L20n to be like this on purpose.</p>
<p>The goal was the encourage some repetition and redundancy in the syntax in
order to allow for more customization.  All for the sake of being able to
create better UI.</p>
<p>ICU's <a href=\"http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/text/MessageFormat.html\">MessageFormat</a> and its <a href=\"https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js\">JavaScript implementation</a> handle redundancy
by allowing branching locally inside of localizable strings.  While this is
technically possible (or almost possible) in L20n by using local entities,
I actually think that some redundancy can be healthy and can help improve the
readability of L20n code.</p>

<p>Dear Entrepreneur,</p>
<p>We need you. We – that is the world. Yes, you read that right. The world needs you.</p>
<p>Let me explain: Spain's youth unemployment rate is now close to 60%. Sixty percent. That is more than every second person under the age of 30 being unemployed. Italy's youth unemployment rate recently smashed through the 40% mark. The same is true for many other countries all around the globe. We have more than 7 billion people inhabiting this planet with an annual growth rate of 1.3%. That means we double the population every 50 years. A friend recently told me that we need 600 million sustainable jobs by 2020.</p>
<p>I fundamentally believe that the only way to get there is through entrepreneurship. We need people like you who are building companies, solving some of the most pressing problems in the world and create jobs doing so.</p>
<p>These are pretty scary and incredibly exciting times. While there is revolutions and uprisings looming, we will also witness the world's online population double in the next 5-10 or so years. Imagine what it will mean for the planet to have 2 billion more people with access to the web, Wikipedia and the global marketplace.</p>
<p>With that being said – we have our work cut out for us. Now is the time. Let's get cranking.</p>" nil nil "64cc9000be29e730affdfd52b7bced0f") (248 (20949 15560 815944) "http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1615" "David Humphrey: Reading =?utf-8?B?4oCcV29yZHPigJ0=?=" "david.humphrey" "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 13:47:40 +0000" "<p>You’ve no doubt seen Justin Jackson’s excellent web site, <a href=\"http://justinjackson.ca/words.html\">Words</a>.  I loved it before I was half-way finished reading the whole way through.  The idea is powerful.  Words are powerful.  The web is powerful.</p>

<blockquote><p>Start with some initial words and continue with your fancy designs, responsive layouts, and scripts that do magical things.</p></blockquote>
<p>I loved this too.  There’s some excellent ideas in both pages, which I encourage you to read and ponder.</p>
<p>I want to say something about how these pages are constructed.  Earlier this year I had an interesting chat with David Ascher about what a modern web page is, and what it means to make something for the web.  We were doing planning work for Webmaker, and trying to think about what a person in 2013 needs to know and do in order to make something on the web.  David made the point that the web is no longer just HTML, CSS, and JS, but also metadata, analytics, APIs, and a host of other connective tissue beneath a skin of browser content.</p>
<p>Words and words.txt provide an interesting opportunity to explore this idea.  What is a web page in 2013, one that is intentionally stripped down, aware of itself, and trying to be nothing more than words?</p>
<p>We can’t do a pure diff of Words and words.txt, since the content isn’t identical, but if we did we see that Words is made of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>words</li>
<li>a doctype</li>
<li>a handful of HTML elements, including <code>html, head, meta, title, body, div, h1, p, strong, em, a</code></li>
<li>a few HTML entities for quotes</li>
<li>a dozen or so URLs</li>
<li>a tiny amount of CSS styling</li>
<li>a small script block with JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>What I find interesting is how Words situates itself within the web.  Because there is so little that isn’t words, it’s useful to consider what is there.</p>
<p>For one, there are links to two different social networks, Twitter and Google+.  It’s also interesting to look at that script.  This script, the so called <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/asyncTracking\">GA or Google Analytics script</a>, is so ubiquitous on the web, it’s almost not worth mentioning, and Justin doesn’t mention it.  I don’t say that because I attribute nefarious intentions to him; quite the opposite, I point it out because it’s so common now that you probably won’t visit many pages today that don’t also have it.  It’s simply become a de facto standard for making web pages.  Whether that’s good or bad is another discussion separate from the fact that it’s reality.</p>
<p>The web isn’t just HTML, CSS, and JS anymore.  The difference between Words and words.txt is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and <em>analytics</em>.  We don’t just write words on the web in 2013–we style them, lay them out, link them to other sites, and then <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115056462967470089501/posts/Ck215SzLx7Y\">watch and count people as they read them</a>.</p>

<h3>Investigating SQLite Performance via Telemetry</h3>
<p>Years ago I tweaked our SQLite clients to use a larger page size. In my testing this seemed to achieve a speedup of 0.2-2x, see <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=416330\" title=\"Suboptimal SQLite page size\">bug 416330</a>. Unfortunately, ~30% of our users are still on the old page size (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=634374\" title=\"Fix page_size of WAL databases\">bug 634374</a>). We used a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/jydoop\">jydoop</a> query to figure out if it’s worth developing a feature to convert these users over using two different (time spent <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/jydoop/blob/master/scripts/places4k.py\">reading</a> & time spent <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/jydoop/blob/master/scripts/places4k-slowsql.py\">executing</a> a query) ways to measure performance differences. According to both methods there is a 4x reduction in sqlite IO waits with the larger page size, so we’ll be adding code to convert people over more aggressively.</p>
<p>This was a cool investigation because it highlighted how much more confidence we have when making performance decisions now (due to telemetry) vs a few years ago.</p>" nil nil "4e06308a5af8a6c9f9352ecb25901037") (243 (20949 15560 812513) "http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1610" "David Humphrey: Webmaker.org after 9 weeks, in 9 weeks" "david.humphrey" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 20:23:56 +0000" "<p>This week I spent a few days meeting with the Mozilla Foundation’s Webmaker engineering and design team in the Toronto office.  It was a great time of reflection after the <a href=\"http://www.cassiemcdaniel.com/blog/the-future-of-webmaking/\">past 9 weeks</a>, and a time to plan the next 9 weeks.  I left feeling like we’re on track, and excited about what’s next, and wanted to share some of my observations.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7321/9162209906_d5de301614.jpg\" title=\"Webmaker planning meeting at MoTo\" width=\"500\" /></p>
<p>For various reasons, our planning horizon has been, and continues to occupy a 9 week period.  Trying to forecast software projects beyond two months is fraught.  The team has really come together around a period of time that honours proper design-first development, and one that also gives engineers space to follow a rigorous process of review, iteration, and deployment (dev, staging, production).  Combining this with our ability to ship to users in short order (everyone on the team can ship, we have proper staging environments, push-button automated deploys, etc), I think the coming 9 weeks are going to be awesome in the way they let us move more quickly.</p>
<p>In order to launch the first iteration of the new <a href=\"https://webmaker.org\">webmaker.org</a>, we had to bring up 5 new apps all at once, with various dependencies between each.  This was hard to do in stages, and so we had to do a “1.0″ style release that happened all on one day.  Over the summer, this won’t be necessary, since we can now iterate on our platform, apps, and content in parallel.  Even weekly trains, as we did with Popcorn Maker in the early winter, feels too slow now, and we’ll be shipping multiple times a day going forward.</p>
<p>So what will we be shipping?  In the next 9 weeks, our goal is <strong>follow-through</strong>.  We shipped an MVP with the new webmaker.org, and we had, and have, many plans that go much further than what’s there now.  We’re ready to dive into some of these now.  At a high-level, this includes working toward shipping the following in the coming months:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webmaker Localization (l10n)</strong>:  I’ve <a href=\"http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1605\">already written about this</a>, and we remain bullish on localizing webmaker.org by the end of the summer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Ray Goggles:</strong> everyone who has ever used it loves this tool, and we do too.  <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875991\">Making it work in the new webmaker.org</a> is a high priority for us.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open MakeAPI to 3rd Party Users</strong>: we think the MakeAPI, with its idea of cataloging and making discoverable the things one makes, is useful beyond just working with our own tools.  We’ve already heard from 3rd party apps that want to use it, and we’re going to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=888285\">update it so this is possible</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on Mobile Experience:</strong> having webmaker.org work in mobile and be more responsive, is something we’re excited to do.  We’ve already started in this direction, and plan to make it better and better as the summer unfolds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Webmaker Mobile Web App:</strong> we also want to try our hand at creating a new Webmaker tool specifically for mobile, and geared to allowing users to publish to the MakeAPI more seamlessly.  This is at the early design phase, so I won’t anticipate direction by saying more.  What I can say is that we’re planning to leverage the open web platform (hi there, Firefox OS!).  I know Cassie, Kate, and others will have more to say on it soon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improve makes.org:</strong> the user publishing makes.org domain is one of our most loved features in the new site, and we have plans to take it further, adding things like user profile pages, better page and URL naming, analytics, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Media Sync</strong>: making on the web means using a variety of services, tools, and publishing platforms.  Users of the web know that one doesn’t use just a single site or work only using one account or identity.  With webmaker.org, we want to make it possible to more easily access and use the disparate bits one has created across the web.  We’d like to allow users to access their work on YouTube, Flickr, SoundCloud, etc., and use it to make and remix new work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI and UX Improvements in our Tools:</strong> we have lots of ideas to improve how our existing tools work, make them more fun and easier to use.  Some of these are small and others will take many weeks.  Watch for things to evolve.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scripts in Thimble:</strong> we’ve been working hard toward allowing our users to safely include JavaScript in their published makes for some time.  Doing this properly has meant a bunch of engineering work in our publishing code, and we’re still putting the final touches on it.  But we’re really close, and I know Pomax is currently getting the final pieces in place.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content, Content, Content:</strong> the new webmaker.org is built around content and enabling newer and better content types is something we’re already working to do.  Additionally, we have UI changes that we need to ship to make this content easier to find and remix</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tutorials:</strong> our current solution for tutorials is really a first effort at an MVP.  There’s a lot more we can do, and figuring out how to do them well is on our list.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to some of these big ticket things, there’s a host of other work that will occupy us as we go forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying down technical- and design-debt</li>
<li>Creating a Style Guide for our UI and UX</li>
<li>Creating Documentation for ourselves and users</li>
<li>Doing more User Testing</li>
<li>Figuring out how to do proper QA and User Support</li>
<li>Staying on top of Security bugs and issues</li>
</ul>
<p>And obviously we’ll continue to have fun!  This is one of my favourite teams to work with at Mozilla, and I’d encourage you to join us as we battle our way through the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?product=Webmaker&bug_status=__open__&list_id=6992455\">open bugs</a>.  We’re in the #webmaker channel on irc, and you are more than welcome to stop by and say ‘hello’.</p>" nil nil "452ca74da4f1a8c08b7dfa063b54dc07") (242 (20949 15560 811517) "http://blog.finette.com/2013/06/28/i-heart-failure" "Pascal Finette: I Heart Failure" "Pascal Finette" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 20:12:01 +0000" "<p>Last week I had the privilege to present a short deck on \"The importance of failure\" at a conference for entrepreneurs and startups in Germany.

Backbone seemed to be confusing me more than helping me, and Angular got a
<em>lot</em> of good press at <a href=\"http://fluentconf.com/fluent2013\">FluentConf</a> this
year.</p>
<p>So this morning’s task in <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/commits/feature/angular\">the re-write</a> was to
re-hook up the <a href=\"https://login.persona.org/about\">Persona</a> integration.  I had
read recently that when you had a lot of dom-manipulation functions, you should
probably put that code in a directive, and since I hadn’t written an Angular
directive yet, I figured this would be a great time to learn how.  Writing <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/blob/feature/angular/views/index.html#L30\">the
html</a>
was pretty easy, of course, and most of the code from the existing
implementation (which was largely based on the code from the <a href=\"https://github.com/jbuck/express-persona/blob/master/README.md\">express-persona
readme</a>) could
be ported over fairly quickly.  The only tricky part I ran into was figuring
out that I needed to include <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/angular-tools/blob/master/persona.js#L36\"><code>restrict: 'E'</code></a> in the
<a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive#directivedefinitionobject\">Directive Definition Object</a>.  After I
was done, I noticed that there really wasn’t that much in the code that had
anything to do with the tool I’m writing, and thus I pulled it out into a
separate repo so that other people can use it.</p>
<p>And with that, I announce <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/angular-tools/\">Angular-Tools</a>, a repo containing one or more tools

"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 10:43:00 +0000" "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">We use Mercurial to manage the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla source tree</a>. Locally I use the Mercurial Queues (mq) extension to manage my patch queue. Mq keeps a stack of patches and provides commands (qnew, qpush, etc.) for applying, updating, and managing patches. The patches are kept in a 'patches' subdirectory in the project's .hg directory. Also in that directory are two files of meta-data - 'status' and 'series'. The former is binary data and keeps track of which patches are currently applied. The latter is text and contains an ordered list of your patches. By fiddling with the 'series' file you can manually add, remove, and re-order patches in a queue.<br /><br />I have several real and virtual machines with multiple copies of the tree on each (not always the same tree - moz-central vs inbound, for example). Keeping the patches in sync is a pain. I have to do this when testing on different platforms and when landing patches (moving from my dev tree to my clean clone of inbound). One solution is creating a user repo in the patch queue. You can then manage your queue as another repo. This is nice because you get history and can wind back mistakes, as well as backup and synchronisation. However, it is a bit cumbersome. I would prefer something more convenient for syncing between repos on the same and different machines. So, I thought what if I could use Dropbox to sync the patch queues? After all for keeping files in sync, Dropbox is as convenient as it gets. It turns out to be not that easy because Dropbox will not sync files outside of the Dropbox directory and hg will not allow you to use any directory other than '.hg/patches' for your patch queue. Furthermore you can't just use a symlink because you really don't want to synchronise the 'status' file, only the patches (and Dropbox will not exclude files). (Sometimes I want to synchronise the 'series' file, and sometimes not).<br /><br />My solution is to patch the mq extension to allow specifying the path to patches and the meta-data files (yay for open source!). I can then set up symlinks from the subdirectories to my Dropbox directory and we're good to go. The path is to patches is fairly well hard coded into the extension, I couldn't find a way to refer to a completely different directory, which would mean not needing the symlinks. The syncing between repos is not quite real-time, it only happens when I qrefresh, but that's as good as it can get, really. I have to be a bit careful to keep the repos at similar ages so that the patches cleanly apply. Which patches are actually applied is also not synced, so I have to manually track that. And even if a patch is synced, it is not automatically re-applied to the tree. I have to do a manual qpop/qpush. Still, I think this is a real improvement on my workflow. It also means it is easy for people to see what I'm working on in almost real-time, which is pretty cool.<br /><br />If you use qqueue to manage multiple patch queues, this technique should work cleanly with that. Each queue will need a subdirectory for each named path you specify. Each can be symlinked to a different directory in Dropbox or wherever.<br /><br /><b>Instructions</b><br /><br />If you want to set up something like this yourself, you will need to:<br /><br />grab the mercurial source<br />grab my patches<br />apply them<br />build mercurial<br />set up symlinks<br />configure mq<br /><br />Start by cloning the <a href=\"http://selenic.com/hg\" target=\"_blank\">hg repo</a> (I guess we could use a source bundle, but we may as well get the bleeding edge). The easiest way to apply my patches is using a queue, so qinit in the new hg directory. Download and extract the <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74741329/hg/mq_paths.tar.bz2\" target=\"_blank\">patches and series file</a> and un-tar into the hg patches directory. hg qpush -a.<br /><br />Then we need to build mercurial. On Linux this was easy, I needed to install the python-dev package and then just run 'make local' in the hg directory (I'm not going to install the new hg as the default one in case something breaks). Then pop an alias to the new hg in your .bashrc.<br /><br />Building and installing in Windows was much more of a pain, I think in part because I have a load of different versions of Mercurial installed in different places. Also I work half in real windows and half in the moz-build flavour of MinGW. Anyway, the following worked. More information <a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WindowsInstall\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/BuildingOnWindows\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br /><br />After cloning the hg repo, I installed a fresh version of MinGW (I had Python, and I guess its headers). I had to explicitly add '/c/MinGW/bin' or whatever to my PATH (export PATH... in MinGW, not the system-wide Windows version). Then I ran 'python setup.py build --force -c mingw32' from the MinGW console (this failed from the windows command prompt, even after playing with the path environment variable). I then manually copied all the .pyd files from 'hg\\build\\lib.win32-2.7\\mercurial' to 'hg\\mercurial' (where 'hg' is where I cloned hg to). Then I created an alias to the new version of hg similarly to on Linux.<br /><br />Next the symlinks. Actually, it turns out you can't use symlinks (on Linux ), because hg throws a hissy fit because \"security\". But you can use mount - 'mount -o bind $target $link' where target is inside dropbox and link is inside .hg/patches. You can put the mount in your /etc/fstab to re-mount on startup.<br /><br />On Windows use 'mklink /J $link &target'. Note the order of link and target is reversed (compared to mount on Linux) and that you will have to use '\\' not '/'. This only works in the windows command propt, not the MinGW console.<br /><br />Finally you need to configure mq. You do this by editing the hgrc file in the projects '.hg' directory (I guess you could use your ~/.hgrc file (Mercurial.ini on Windows) if you want to use the same sub-paths for all your repos, but I didn't). Add an mq section, you can then set 'seriespath', 'statuspath', 'patchespath', and 'guardspath' to add a sub-path for the various kinds of files. Any kind you don't specify a path for gets put in the usual place (.hg/patches). For example,<br /><br />[mq]<br />seriespath = shared<br />patchespath = shared<br /><br />will result in your patches and series file ending up in '.hg/patches/shared' and your status file in '.hg/patches'. (This is what I do for most of my repos, for some I don't specify seriespath so I can do different things there).<br /><br />Note: sometimes on Windows (never Linux, which is why I haven't fixed this) I see an error message when doing 'hg qnew'. But the patch gets created just fine, so it seems to be fine to ignore this.<br /><br />Finally, if you would like to see what I am working on, you can find my patches <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74741329/ncameron.org/patches.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</div>" nil nil "1aa1ab45cce8c0e4561c3ef9fdb83a5b") (238 (20949 15560 768531) "http://michellethorne.cc/2013/06/making-a-difference-by-making-the-web/" "Michelle Thorne: Making a difference by making the web" "thornet" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 10:19:10 +0000" "<p>These days, with all the Prism/Tempura surveillance we’re learning about, <strong>one can feel quite powerless.</strong></p>

<p>We believe in <strong>user empowerment that balances free expression online with a respect for user privacy.</strong></p>
<p>We want to help people take control of their digital lives—and <strong>foster a user-centric web.</strong> We can <a href=\"http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html\">rebuild the web we lost</a>.</p>
<p>To get there, we <strong>need to help people discover the joy of making things on the web.</strong> It’s important to show that the web is not a scary place. It is fun and useful to participate online while still controlling your data. This is a valuable lesson and one that should trump flashy apps or simple convenience.</p>
<p>I’d like to share some stories about <strong>people who volunteer to <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106022863174952221205\">teach the web</a>.</strong> Be it in their homes, their neighborhood shops, their city squares, or wherever, these are real stories about people who want to empower users of the web.</p>
<p><strong>It’s grassroots, it’s modest, but it’s a start.</strong></p>
<h3>Teach your family</h3>
<p><strong>Activism starts at home.</strong> You begin with the people you care about, the people closest you.</p>
<p>Like the <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Convince-Your-Parents-to-Let-You-Download-Firefox\">activists who install Firefox for their friends and families</a>, <strong>teaching the web at home doesn’t cost anything and is sustainable.</strong> You don’t have to worry about big budgets or outreach. Just help the people in your living room.</p>
<p>This is Unnati, a 14 year-old webmaker. Under the mentorship of <a href=\"http://trendsincomputer.blogspot.de/\">Gauthamraj</a>, she’s gone from learning about the web to teaching it. At home, she’s taught her mother and father how to make the web. And now this year, bolstered by her new confidence in teaching, she’s organizing a <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/events/55\">bigger event in her city</a>.</p>

</a><p><a href=\"https://unnati.makes.org/thimble/433\"></a></p>
<p>And there’s Brendan, who started a <a href=\"http://neenanjones.blogspot.de/2013/05/rocket-launch.html\">maker club with his kids</a>. Together they try out fun projects each week and use the web to blog about them. The web is a platform that helps the family find new things to make and to share them with the world.</p>

<h3>Teach your neighbors</h3>
<p><strong>Sometimes to make a difference, you want to go outside your home.</strong> Teaching your neighbors is a natural next step. It’s about giving back to your community and helping people near you.</p>
<p>That’s <a href=\"http://merajimran.blogspot.in/2013/06/maker-party-shopkeeper-venus-residence.html\">what Meraj did</a>. <strong>He visited a shopkeeper on the corner, and taught them how to hack.</strong> The shopkeeper <a href=\"https://merajimran.makes.org/thimble/this-is-a-make-made-by-shopkeeper-avenu\">made a new website</a> for his store, and his whole family left <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0uK-tQv2OA&feature=youtu.be\">feeling empowered and joyful</a> about the possibilities of the web.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2313\" height=\"309\" src=\"http://michellethorne.cc/wp-content/uploads/making-in-a-shop-e1372411139640.jpg\" title=\"making in a shop\" width=\"550\" /></p>
<p>Recently, the Greek government abruptly shut down the state broadcaster, ERT, as part of its ongoing austerity drive. To help <strong>keep the news on air,</strong> Nikos, Freddy and Pierros ran workshops to teach webmaking and Open News tools to professional and citizen journalists. <strong>Set up in a public square, they <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ertops\">taught fellow Greek citizens how to be the makers of their own news.</a></strong></p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2314\" height=\"782\" src=\"http://michellethorne.cc/wp-content/uploads/ertops-e1372411424696.jpg\" title=\"ertops\" width=\"550\" /></p>
<h3>Teach the teachers</h3>
<p>Once you’ve taught your family and your neighbors, the next step is to <strong><a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/05/webmaker-train-the-trainer/\">teach other people how to teach the web.</a></strong> This means helping others develop techniques and tools that they can use to teach their family and neighbors.</p>
<p>This step is harder, but ultimately very powerful. <strong>It can increase the impact of grassroots engagement by an order of magnitude.</strong></p>
<p>Lawrence and San James organized their <strong><a href=\"http://www.newslibre.com/news/webmaker-mentor-training-kampala/\">first “train the trainer” event in Kampala, Uganda.</a></strong> They wanted to host a multi-stop webmaking tour to local schools, and in order to teach all those students, they needed more mentors.</p>
<p>Using techniques from <a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/05/webmaker-train-the-trainer/\">our training in Athens</a>, Lawrence and San James successfully mentored 40 new teachers. Lawrence noted, “It didn’t feel like a training but like a collaborative exchange of knowledge and ideas on hacking the web.”</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2317\" height=\"359\" src=\"http://michellethorne.cc/wp-content/uploads/train-the-trainers-kampala-e1372412408842.jpg\" title=\"train the trainers kampala\" width=\"540\" /></p>
<p>To scale these efforts even more, we launched an online training/collaboration called <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/\">Teach the Web</a>. With nearly 6,000 participants, and despite <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/teachtheweb-so-you-want-to-run-a-cmooc/\">all the associated challenges of coordinating and mentoring so many people</a>, it was incredibly rewarding to find so many kindred spirits who care about making the web.</p>
<p>These are stories from the participants in this course. <strong>And there are many more.</strong></p>
<h3>The Web is made by people</h3>
<p>As the first iteration of the #teachtheweb course comes to a close this week, we’re asking ourselves: <strong>what next?</strong></p>
<p>There are a several promising opportunities. Several mentors are <strong><a href=\"https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/articulos-weblitstd/\">localizing the course</a></strong> and will run the it again in different languages, including Spanish, French and hopefully others.</p>
<p>We’d also <strong>like to repeat the course,</strong> rolling in <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/teachtheweb-so-you-want-to-run-a-cmooc/\">what we learned this time around</a>. Likely, the course will be shorter (3 weeks instead of 9) and perhaps involve more tools than just webmaker ones.</p>
<p>I’d also love to see <strong>more resources on how to teach privacy.</strong> I whipped up a <a href=\"https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/lh00/\">prototype to teach encryption</a>, using material from the EFF. But there’s a lot more we can do to make these topics approachable, fun and easy to learn.</p>
<p>As we look to what else we can do, how we can promote a third way of online participation, I’m reminded of a story <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/113905697837976594807/posts\">Jeannie</a> told. She was helping a young learner make his first website. After publishing on the web, something clicked for him. <strong>He said, “Wow, so if I can make and share something on the web, does that mean that everything on the web is made by people?”</strong></p>
<p>Yes, yes it is. And we can do our part to help more people not be intimated or indifferent about the web, but <strong>instead to make things together and celebrate our shared, connected humanity.</strong></p>

<p>Today we are excited to announce a visual evolution of our Firefox brand that will better fit its extended usage beyond that of a desktop web browser. An overview of our brand history and the reasons for this evolution are <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/creative/?p=138\">covered on our Creative blog</a>, so this article will have a brief look at the previous version and then dive into the various visual changes we’ve made with the new design.</p>
<h3>What was new is now old</h3>
<p>The 2009-2013 Firefox logo is an amazing piece of artwork. That launch visual evolution focused on creating a refined visual element that spoke to the power and newness of the browser – a beautiful asset for a beautiful product. I use that logo every day in my work, and thanks to the Mozilla brand guide and assets repository, more and more people are using it as well. </p>
<p>Through my work and interacting with others who used it in video, print and web, it has become clear that though beautiful, the artwork does come with a few usage concerns like SVG compatibility and color consistency. We’ve listened to feedback over the years and documented these examples. Now, with the desire to reshape the look to reflect our brand evolution, this is the perfect time to step back and solve these issues.</p>
<div class=\"large-image-1129\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"657\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-4.png\" width=\"992\" /></div>
<h3>Make the logo simpler</h3>
<div class=\"large-side-1129\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-2.png\" width=\"300\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-3.png\" width=\"300\" />
<div class=\"callout-1129\">Simplifying a style doesn’t always mean bringing it down to basic geometric shapes and solid colors.</div>
</div>
<p>Simplifying a style doesn’t always mean bringing it down to basic geometric shapes and solid colors. You can in fact bring simplicity to a visual by better balancing color, contrast, shape, and detail. To that last point, we removed quite a bit of detail in this latest revision but purposely added more detail where needed to accommodate today’s high resolution screens. The simplification process not only focused on the look but also the structure by making it SVG compatible and more accessible for the broader Mozilla community.</p>
<p>The first step in the rebuild was to go in and strip out all the detail that was using blend mode layering such as multiply, screen and overlay – mostly found in the tail area <span class=\"point-1129\">1</span>. As stated, a key goal of the redesign was to make it work flawlessly in SVG as well as open up the possibility to rebuild all the internal structure using SVG and CSS gradients. Having reduced the logo down to its shape-tweaked forms <span class=\"point-1129\">2</span> and softer gradients, we continued to remove any detail we thought wasn’t critical to the overall image. This tied into another goal of having the image hold up with greater clarity at smaller sizes.</p>
<p>Once we had removed a fair amount of detail in the logo, it was time to look at introducing enhanced detail where it would be needed when scaled to larger sizes. Stephen Horlander recreated all the continents <span class=\"point-1129\">3</span> on the globe with high resolution displays in mind and we paired those with a removal of the high gloss <span class=\"point-1129\">4</span> to create a softer, deeper color globe. Combining these deeper blues with now lighter oranges in softer detailed fur <span class=\"point-1129\">5</span>, we achieved that greater contrast that would create better separation of the elements at all sizes.</p>
<p>A final touch that you may notice in the new logo (and one that makes me very happy) is the arm of the fox now extends from a shoulder instead of layering behind his chest <span class=\"point-1129\">6</span>. It’s a small detail, but it really seems to unify the form of the fox and make him feel more cohesive a brand element.</p>
<p>So there it is. Not a logo redesign, but a simplification in form and function. We hope you are as excited about the new look as we are about using it! Enjoy!</p>" nil nil "cc152d7232e938cc3475c5a527c1eb29") (234 (20949 15560 764147) "http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/2013/06/fighting-good-fight-direction-for.html" "Michael Coates: Fighting the Good Fight =?utf-8?Q?=E2=80=93?= A Direction for Mozilla to Lead the Open Web" "Michael Coates" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 16:38:00 +0000" "<div class=\"MsoNormal\">Mozilla found its way over ten years ago when       we saw the web       spiraling into peril. The web was stagnating, it was controlled,       and users had       no choice or voice in the future of the web. Here began Firefox, a       collective       effort where individuals around the world could contribute and       build the web       that they wanted to see. Fast-forward and we now see a healthy web       where       competition in browsing options spurs advancement and growth. </div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">But the web is transforming again. The battle       is not for       what browser you chose to use at your desk, but the entire       ecosystem that       powers the computer in your pocket. Not unlike the monopoly we saw       years ago       that stifled the web, we are now watching a distinct divide being       built in       mobile. This divide isolates users and forces them to choose which       part of the       web they want to live in. Developers can no longer just build for       the web;       instead they must build for each device a user brings to the web,       undermining       the very unity that made the web successful.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">Today Mozilla fights for mobile. To liberate       users from       closed ecosystems and enable developers to build for the web in       whatever shape       it is accessed – be that from desktop or mobile devices. We are       bringing       technologies that have powered the web into the foundation of a       mobile operating       system. This is combined with a design that enables developers to       use the       technologies they know and that have powered the web to easily       build powerful       mobile apps. We see a future of the web where mobile is not       different from the       web, only a different size serving different needs of the user. In       the end, the       technologies that power the web should be harnessed to also power       the web       experienced on mobile.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">But while we focus on the battleground of today       we must also       look forward to see what is next. The future always seems distant       until it is       right upon you. Mozilla must continue to be competitive so that we       can fight       for the users and be a driving force in the open web. We must look       past the fog       of today’s concerns to prepare for how to guide and shape the web       in the next       major phase. We’ve seen the web transform from something accessed       purely by a       desktop device to a mobile web that you carry with you in your       pocket. In       mobile, the web is where wherever the user goes, provided they       have their       device. But just as mobile has grown it too will one day yield to       the next       major shift of the web. I believe that shift will be to a user       centric web.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">A user centric web does not care what device       you use to       access the web. Desktop computer, mobile phone, tablet, TV screen,       car console,       wearable device and more - the web will be synonymous with the       user and the web       will follow the user wherever they go. Users will be less       concerned about       static web sites and apps, but more about their world, the way the       web       integrates into their daily lives and activities and every device       that the user       interacts with. To prepare for the next phase of the web Mozilla       must invest in       technologies that bring the web to the user regardless of their       device. The       center of the web will be the user.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">This requires a focus on identity, cloud, and       broadening the       reach of our platform. A user must be in control of their identity       on the web       with the ability to easily and seamless represent their identity       wherever they       may be. A user may have several devices they use often, but the       web will be       expected to function equally wherever they may be. To achieve this       Mozilla must       invest in cloud and creating a representation of a user, their       profile, their       identity and desires that is not tied to a particular device, but       rather to the       user directly. We also must continue to expand the platform to       other closed       ecosystems. Many companies will want to harness the web to attract       users, but a       closed ecosystem is an ecosystem that does not empower users and       rarely       represents the user’s desires and voice.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">The future is murky and can easily pivot at any       moment. The       choices of today’s technologies, many of which are heavily       debated, can greatly       influence what comes next. But if Mozilla is truly a leader of the       open web       then we must look past the obstacles of today and envision what       will come tomorrow.       Instead of waiting to liberate users from the next stranglehold,       let’s build       the foundation for the next phase of the open web. A web that       represents the       user, enables developers, and supports advancement in       technologies. </div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">Mozilla was built on the power of a massive       worldwide       community that fought the good fight for no other reason than it       was the right       thing to do. Let’s look forward and prepare to lead what comes       next for the       web.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>mcoates</span></div><span>    </span><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>mozillian </span></div>" nil nil "65dc178b525bfb6dad932f79abc6b79b") (233 (20949 15560 762845) "http://xulforge.com/blog/2013/06/android-in-4-easy-steps/" "Jorge Villalobos: Make your add-on support Android in 4 easy steps" "jorge" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 14:25:50 +0000" "<p>As you may know by now, we’re running an add-on developer contest called <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/amp-your-firefox/\"><strong>Amp Your Firefox</strong></a>. We’re very excited about it and there are various categories you can compete in, but we <em>especially</em> care about the mobile categories. We want to grow our collection of <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/android/\">add-ons for Android</a>, so that Android users can enjoy the fully customizable experience that is Firefox.</p>
<p>I have been working on making many of my add-ons Android-compatible (alas, I don’t qualify for the contest, being both an employee and a judge!). So I wanted to give you a quick primer on how easy it is to convert add-ons or create new ones that work for Android, from the perspective of someone who has already worked on desktop add-ons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Add Android compatibility to your manifest.</strong> That means supporting <code><em:id>{aa3c5121-dab2-40e2-81ca-7ea25febc110}</em:id></code> in your target applications, and adding <code><em:bootstrap>true</em:bootstrap></code> to make it restartless.</li>
<li><strong>Set up your <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions\">bootstrap.js</a> script.</strong> This replaces a good chunk of your overlay. This script is responsible for setting up and then clearing any UI elements that you want to add, and running any startup scripts. The <code>chrome.manifest</code> file is loaded normally, so any additional XUL, locale files and CSS are also loaded. Keep in mind that add-on UI on Android is pretty much limited to the content area, but you can still load XUL pages using <code>chrome</code> or <code>about</code> URLs. XPCOM and JS Modules are pretty much the same.</li>
<li><strong>Set up your bootstrap.js script, like, for real.</strong> It’s likely you want your add-on to work both for Android and desktop, so your bootstrap script should handle multiple windows well and clean up after itself. <a href=\"http://www.oxymoronical.com\">Mossop</a> wrote a <a href=\"http://www.oxymoronical.com/blog/2011/01/Playing-with-windows-in-restartless-bootstrapped-extensions\">great post with sample code</a> you can reuse to make sure you’ve covered your bases during install, uninstall, and windows opening and closing.</li>
<li><strong>Read the docs!</strong> Should this be the first step? … maybe, what do I know. You can find everything you need here: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile\">Extensions for Android</a>. You’ll especially want to get acquainted with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile/API/NativeWindow\"><code>NativeWindow</code></a> object, for Android-specific UI, and the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile/API/BrowserApp\"><code>BrowserApp</code></a> object, which is sort of the replacement of the <code>gBrowser</code> object / <code><tabbrowser></code> element.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was surprised at how easy it was to create add-ons that work on Android, and to port some of the ones I had already created. Userscript-type add-ons work very well because they generally don’t need UI outside of the content, so porting my <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/AMO-Admin-Assistant\">AMO Admin Assistant</a> add-on was pretty much trivial. More UI-heavy add-ons like <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/Remote-XUL-Manager\">Remote XUL Manager</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/CTP-Manager\">Click-to-Play Manager</a> required more thought. They both open a XUL window, which I ended up converting into an <code>about</code> page in the mobile version. I also created the <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/Mobile-Installer\">Mobile Installer</a> add-on exclusively for Android, which is more of a sample add-on I made for a talk, but uses more of the Android-specific APIs in <code>NativeWindow</code>. It’s also a nice little tool that makes it easier to install XPIs after you’ve copied them to your device.</p>
<p>All of the add-on links above point to Github, in case you’re interested in looking at their code and using some of it on your own add-ons. I hope this motivates you to give Android add-ons a try, and step up to the challenge in Amp Your Firefox. All you need is to submit your entry and have your add-on approved on AMO to win an awesome t-shirt, so I really don’t know what additional motivation is needed <img alt=\";)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://xulforge.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> .</p>

It was about people who care about the web and web literacy and working together to find ways to spread skills to learners. This post is a reflection on the meta structures and processes that created the experience. <strong>It's also only <em>mildly</em> reflective of the learning that occurred.</strong> <strong>These observations completely delude the very human and personal feelings I have towards the #teachtheweb community and all the individuals within it. </strong><em>[Update: Luckily, <a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/06/making-a-difference-by-making-the-web/\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle nails the human side of this story in her post.</a>]<strong>
</strong></em>
Although this post is going to sound a bit academic, a couple of my colleagues are going to be writing about the amazing stories and community members that made <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb</a> so incredibly awesome. And I'm sure I'll have more to say about my newly expanded <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Personal learning network\">personal learning network</a> and the KICK ASS MOZILLIANS who participated in #teachtheweb.
<h3>After #teachtheweb, I'm working under two assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are lurkers in this community.</strong> Lurkers are reading, looking, observing, maybe even making things, but they're not sharing in this community, or they're not sharing often.</li>
<li><strong>Activity fluctuates.</strong> Some people have time for #teachtheweb all at once or in spurts. Others take a certain amount of time each week. Some people dip in only on certain topics, others are fairly constant throughout.</li>
</ul>
[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<img alt=\"\" class=\" \" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ShZp9A2.png\" width=\"500\" /> Well, we didn't have at least one person from EVERY country, but...[/caption]
<h3>And three absolute certainties:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our metric overview is flawed.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter much because people are definitely learning together.</li>
<li><strong>#teachtheweb is an unmitigated success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Metrics and Multiple Channels</h3>
In the #teachtheweb experience, we have multiple channels where people can participate, so we have multiple channels to collect metrics from. Unfortunately, <strong>collecting accurate metrics is next to impossible</strong> for a couple of reasons:
<ol>
<li>We didn't get Analytics onto the <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb site</a> until AFTER the first week (oops.)</li>
<li>The sign up mechanism is connected to <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">webmaker.org/teach</a>, but signing up is not required for participation because everything is open. We cannot differentiate between traffic from participants and traffic from people who never signed up.</li>
<li>People don't always tag their stuff. Sometimes there are typos (e.g. #teactheweb).</li>
<li>We encouraged self created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/zythepsary.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al0Wg7eR7tHcdDRGVEJCMEFXbmRwV3RUamhHRVlfRHc#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">Study Groups</a> (not oops, but a fail if we're talking about metrics). Study Groups may be using other hashtags and special lists. There are several untrackable study groups using private groups, communities, forums, email, etc.</li>
<li>We are sure to miscount membership. There's members vs active members vs people who are also members of the main G+.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Data Viz</h4>
Finding better ways to collect metrics and share them as data visualizations would up participation. When people feel like they're alone in their learning experience, they're much more likely to reserve their participation until others join them. People are hungry for social learning experiences, and data viz is an easy way to show learners that they're not alone.
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://infogr.am/teachtheweb-27148\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"490\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uiZjlxS.png\" width=\"500\" /></a>Here's a shoddy infographic on #teachtheweb.</p>
<h3>Community and tiers of engagement</h3>
At the beginning of #teachtheweb, we talked about three levels of engagement. These levels may eventually be associated with Mozilla Mentor Badges.
<ol>
<li><strong> Mentor-in-Making (level 1)</strong> Be explicit about the agency people have over their own learning by helping them understand there are no deadlines, responsibilities, or criteria for participation. Give them permission to work at their own speed. People aren't used to this. For someone to move from a Mentor-in-Making level to Mentor, <strong>community at higher levels need to serve as examples</strong> in the way they moderate and mentor. The progression to Mentor is extremely transient – Mentors-in-Making who are enthusiastic about their learning will undoubtedly make resources or run events that fulfill the criteria for the Mentor badge.</li>
<li>
[caption id=\"attachment_1929\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"100\"]<img alt=\"Mentor Badge\" class=\" wp-image-1929    \" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mentor-badge-150x150.png\" width=\"100\" /> Mentor Badge[/caption]
<strong>Mentor (level 2)</strong> Progression happens when Mentors-in-Making begin to mentor their peers and creating new open educational resources or run in-person events that teach openness and web skills. <strong>Celebration of participation at this level is as important as participating itself.</strong> The more interaction the typical learner receives from the community and moderators, the more they participate. Helping mentors understand their own agency in this process is very important as well. Advancing through the tiers of engagement requires people at higher engagement levels actively monitoring and mentoring in the various channels and being examples for their peers. Peer to peer learning and support is integral to sustaining the community. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/introducing_mentor_badges\" target=\"_blank\">We've launched this level</a> as the <strong>first Mozilla Webmaker Mentor Community badge</strong>. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/mentor\" target=\"_blank\">Apply for your Mentor badge!</a></li>
<li><strong> Super Mentor (level 3)</strong> Inspiring people to advance to Super Mentor status requires a personal touch and an ambient personification of open values. Again, celebration from the community as well as core staff is massively important. At the highest level, the community is looking for collaborators, mentorship and advice from the \"experts\" in the field. Finding ways to connect Super Mentors with Mentors is important for the cross over from Mentor to Super Mentor. Super Mentors are linked to sustained contribution – be it creating resources for someone else to teach with, running events or mentoring others. <strong>We'll be figuring out more succinct criteria and issuing for the Super Mentor Badge in the coming months.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Moderation + Mentoring</h4>
<strong>Be open from the get-go.</strong> Asking active community members to moderate and mentor potential community members displays trust, which leads to empowerment. <strong>A mistake to avoid</strong> is trying to select only certain community members to contribute to the planning and moderation of the online learning experience. Instead, certain community members should receive personal outreach and asks, but the community as a whole should receive an invitation to contribute.
<h3>Content Creation</h3>
<a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/planning/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Planning #teachtheweb\">Asking for \"braindumps\"</a> was a great way to get a lot of different ideas, but we may have gotten more contribution had we prepared more topic specific questions that helped people formulate their thoughts around base ideas. Keeping the it in an open form, like <a href=\"http://etherpad.mozilla.org\" target=\"_blank\">Etherpad</a>, allowed people to riff off each other's ideas, which made it easier to find patterns and threads.
However, content contributions dropped steadily throughout the nine weeks. Here's a graph:<img alt=\"contentcontributors_graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1924\" height=\"394\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contentcontributors_graph.png\" width=\"498\" />
<strong>It's draining to do active engagement while concurrently creating content.</strong> Because active conversation needs to take place if we want people to move up the tiers of engagement, preparing content and content creation mechanisms in advance is recommended. This procedure can, in and of itself, be an outreach method and works well under specific deadlines.
It might help to ask specific people to contribute to specific things based on interest and expertise. No amount of begging will help in the content creation department though, so <strong>be prepared to do the heavy lifting!</strong>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" height=\"738\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cfLzl5r.png\" />If we intend to do multiple initiatives like #teachtheweb, it would be useful to have a place where all this content can land. Wordpress might be the right technology, but our structure needs to change. Having better tools for filtering and connecting the <a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\">G+ Community</a> to the wordpress structure would be helpful. We might just need to take more time and more expertise setting up wordpress to be more user friendly for online learning.
The G+ firehose is also something to think about. <strong>There are pros and cons to using G+</strong>. For administration, there is no overview of G+, no substructuring, no archiving and it's difficult to find things (unless you know very specifically what something is called, who posted it, etc). It's a social network rather than a knowledge management system.
Additionally, despite attempts at categories, people don't tag and organize their own posts beyond the default stream. A more useful tool, in my view, would be some sort of a kick ass forum where everyone is together, could separate into groups within the structure, can tag, comment and share. <a href=\"http://discourse.org/\">Yes, I'm thinking something specific here.</a>
The facts that we've already built such a large community and that our potential community is likely already using G+ means that it would be difficult to move people from G+ to another system. However, it is something to consider.
If we intend to do multiple online learning experiences like teachtheweb, with a variety of audiences, topics and hashtags – we should think about modifying the existing system to <strong>make it easier for everyone to see what's happening in the community</strong> without having to invest the hours it would take to get an overview of this experience.
<h3>Duration & Modularity</h3>
Something that wasn't clear with the #teachtheweb online learning experience is that someone can join in any time. Advertising the experience as \"a nine week course\" was both true to form and misleading, particularly because we transitioned into <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/party\" target=\"_blank\">Maker Party</a> and aren't actually going anywhere.<strong> The only thing that's different now is that we won't send curated content every week.</strong> We're still active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> and in<a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\" target=\"_blank\"> the G+ community</a>.
Instead of having new topics each week, we might think about having monthly themes. It's lower bar than a 9 week collection of topics, but it means we'll have various groups dipping in and out of content.
<strong>#teachtheweb had a comparatively low attrition rate.</strong> In #teachtheweb approximately 18% of participants were still active in the final week.<strong> This is pretty awesome</strong>, considering that the average MOOC has less than 10% of participants in the final week*. This data is mostly speculative because I didn't really take the time to do full analysis week by week of participants and their online actions. I just compared share and tweet numbers between Week 1 and Week 8, if someone wants to do a full analysis, let me know, and I'll share the data I have :)
If we're going to run varying lengths and varying content, we should think about finding a way that this form of work can always tie together, yet stand alone. It has a lot to do with the tiers of participation, and the technology we use to post this content.
<h4>Time Boxing Pros and Cons</h4>
<div style=\"width: 53%; float: left; margin-right: 1em;\">
<strong> Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>lots of excitement and involvement right away</li>
<li>easy to set a rhythm for production, meetings, etc</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style=\"float: left; width: 44%;\">
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>people think it ends and, therefore, don't sign up if they feel they are late</li>
<li>no room for schedule shifts</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Subversive engagement + humor</h3>
Finding ways to joke and play in an online space like #teachtheweb seems really important. Experimenting with subversive +mentioning in G+, random tweeting at people and sharing relevant but goofy things from across the web helps with keeping contribution up. It might not seem like something you need to plan for, but it actually is. Finding humorous and relevant shares and/or makes can be time consuming.
<h3>Making</h3>
<a href=\"https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-make-a-kit-template/remix\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/images/assembly_thumb.png\" width=\"150\" /></a>We launched the <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">hackable templates</a> through #teachtheweb. We launched dirty prototypes, and people took them and used them in ways we'd never imagined. These templates have already become staple in Mozteach content. They continue to be an extremely successful model for Mentor content creation.
<strong>Make stuff.</strong> Give optional readings. Maybe some videos. But <strong>focus on making stuff.</strong> No discussion to be had. Inspire people to make and then be blown away by what happens.
<h3>Tell Me Stuff</h3>
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this post and am happy to answer questions. It's a long post, but could have been much longer.

<p>So in what is probably a rather poorly kept secret I now no longer work for the Mozilla Foundation, in fact my last day was last week but in an attempt to stay ‘offline’ for a little while after that I’m only starting to look at the blogs and that kind of stuff again now. </p>
<h3>tl;dr</h3>
<ul>
<li>with everything that they’re doing, and everything not work related that I’ll now need to be doing it felt like a good time to go</li>
<li>not sure what the future hold yet – but let me know of anything interesting you have (rossbruniges at gmail dot com)</li>
<li>mozilla is a great place to work – I’m happy to have done so and hopefully left a good legacy of websites, standards and friends!</li>
</ul>
<p><span id=\"more-313\"></span></p>
<h3>But why?!</h3>
<p>I was there over 2 years and saw us grow from a team of roughly 15 (possibly not even that) to one that’s now well over 60 – it was quite and growth and it’s now quite a team but when I look at things it was a good time for me to go. At a time when they needed me at my very best I had <a href=\"http://www.thecssdiv.co.uk/2013/05/the-bad-week/\">too many external things happening</a> to also give them what I wanted, a lot of the sites that I made last year were in the process of being re-written and a couple of projects I helped get off the ground are now coming to a close; hopefully I’ve left a good stable launch pad for their next attack on making the next generation of webmakers.</p>
<h3>So what have I left behind?</h3>
<p>A lot of websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://mozillaignite.org\">Mozilla Ignite</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://mozillaopennews.org\">Mozilla Open News</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://www.thecssdiv.co.uk/source.mozillaopennews.org\">source.mozillaopennews.org</a></li>
<li><a href=\"https://gameon.mozilla.org\">GameOn (2012)</a></li>
<li>Mozilla Festival:
<ul>
<li><a href=\"http://mozillafestival.org\">Mozilla Festival (2012)</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://2011.mozillafestival.org\">Mozilla Festival (2011)</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>including a couple that are now no longer around (<a href=\"https://drumbeat.org\">mozilla drubmeat</a>) and the ‘old’ (or better sounding version 1.0) of <a href=\"https://webmaker.org\">webmaker.org</a>. I also contributed code to <a href=\"https://mozillalabs.com/projects/\">Mozilla Labs</a>, <a href=\"https://mozilla.org\">mozilla.org</a> and even removed a <blink> from <a href=\"http://myfavoritebeer.org/\">the very first demo-site showing Mozilla Persona</a>!</p>
<div class=\"photo_frame\" style=\"width: 100%;\"><img alt=\"6937708307_e7c226facd\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-321\" height=\"375\" src=\"http://content.thecssdiv.co.uk/uploads/2013/06/6937708307_e7c226facd.jpg\" width=\"500\" />The fridges are no longer empty</div>
<p>An office that hopefully will continue to hold awesome webdev events (I’ve hosted Djugl and LWS there in recent months), hackdays and Mozilla parties; and one that I’m looking to head back to for epic events soon.</p>
<h3>So what’s next?</h3>
<p>As of right now I don’t really have any future plans – no new job lined up and I’ve not put too much thought into where I go next; after a long time of work, work work I’m going to re-charge my batteries, get writing again and play around with a few things that I’ve yet to play with and be around for some people who could do with my help right now.</p>
<p>Saying that if you’ve got a cool job going or know of one then I’ve got time to meet up and talk so let me know – rossbruniges at gmail dot com</p>
<h4>Speaking opportunities?</h4>
<p>Something that has meant that I’ve not done as much of this as I would like is that it always takes me a while to write a talk – but I now have a bit of time, so if you want to hear me talk about things, how things work at Mozilla, working remotely, getting things done or anything else let me know – rossbruniges at gmail dot com.</p>
<h3>Is Mozilla still a good place to work at?</h3>
<p><strong>YES</strong> – and they’re hiring so head over to <a href=\"http://careers.mozilla.org/#sections\">careers.mozilla.org</a> and see what is there. There are coding jobs but also account manager, project and events manager roles and if you love the web and want to work with other people who do then this is an awesome, challenging but also rewarding place to be. I you want to ask about any of the roles please feel free to get in touch and I’ll see what I can say and try and put you in touch with the right people. But the very best thing you can do is apply – that’s what I did over two years ago and it was a great ride from then on.</p>
<p>They say ‘once Mozilla, always Mozilla’ – and I’m proud to be able to be included in that collective now.</p>" nil nil "15126e38f230c084bdba2eea9c63a4d2") (229 (20949 15560 757847) "http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/2013/06/mozilla-summit-summit-assembly-planning.html" "Michael Coates: Mozilla Summit - Summit Assembly Planning Event" "Michael Coates" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 06:00:00 +0000" "About 10 days ago a group of around 70 Mozillians met in the Mozilla Paris office for two full days of brainstorming, planning, and discussions.

However, I would encourage those that are leading an unconference event to set a bit of high level context. Free flowing structure is great, but a little bit of overall goal setting is also a good complimentary item.<br /><br />During the event I led two micro sessions on topics that were important to me. The first sessions was \"Building a Framework for Decision Making at Mozilla\". This micro session was merged with another related topic suggested by Jishnu titled \"The Nature of Dissent\". The micro session was well attended with a lot of great ideas. More to come on this over the coming weeks. I'm planning to work with the team to flush out the framework and present at brown bags leading up to the summit.<br /><br />The second microsession was centered around understanding the end user when designing security and privacy features. A strong point that was raised during this micro session was the idea of identifying the user types, their desires for greater security controls, and the types of trade offs they may be interested in making (if any) for these additional features. The main point was that an understanding of the target audience is required when building additional features and security & privacy features are no different here. We have more work to do on this topic, but there's a lot of valuable information that can come from this.<br /><br />The next steps after the summit assembly are to continue working with group leads to flush out the various summit tracks. Much more information to come. But based on the energy and enthusiasm at the assembly planning event I think we're going to have a fantastic Summit in just a few months.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: small;\">--<br /></span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span>mcoates</span></span><span> </span><br /><span>mozillian</span>" nil nil "a2496fd182a3540688b44900165da82f") (228 (20949 15560 757347) "http://globau.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/happy-bmo-push-day-52/" "Byron Jones: happy bmo push day!"

"selena" "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 23:29:22 +0000" "<p><em>This is a lightly edited version of an email I sent to pgsql-hackers today.</em></p>
<p>Josh Berkus asked:</p>
<p><strong>> How should reviewers get credited in the release notes?</strong></p>
<p>Without getting into how the community might decide to do this, I thought it might be helpful to share the reasons why I believe recognizing and expressing gratitude to reviewers is a helpful, useful and gratifying exercise for the Postgres community.</p>
<p>I support crediting reviewers in a more formal way than we currently do for a few different reasons.</p>
<p>First, I believe it’s worth finding a way to say “Hey, you just did something great for Postgres”, publicly, to a bunch of people who could have spent their valuable time and energy in some other way.</p>
<p>Second, reviewers get better at their work by reviewing multiple times – so I’d like to encourage people to review more than once.</p>
<p>Third, reviewers don’t always need to be expert developers, or experts at Postgres to get started, but many people who do open source work have no idea this is true. Public recognition helps make it clear that we have people who give useful reviews and are relative novices.</p>
<p>We also have several different kinds of reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>“does it compile”</li>
<li>style/typo/easily seen bug passes</li>
<li>in-depth discussion of design choices, use case, interface</li>
<li>complex testing cases</li>
<li>performance testing</li>
<li>pre-commit checks for more subtle bugs or committer preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those, except probably the very last, can be done by people who are familiar with Postgres or its configuration, but aren’t necessarily Postgres or C experts.</p>
<p>Fourth, we have very few accepted ways to recognize contributions to Postgres. Naming in Release Notes is one way this community has consistently supported as a <em>public</em> way to say “hey, you just did something great for Postgres”. The complete list of ways I’m aware of are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recognizing major, minor and emeritus contributors</li>
<li>Making someone a committer</li>
<li>Being part of the -core group</li>
<li>Naming authors by name in commit messages (but without consistent metadata, making it difficult to count well)</li>
<li>Naming authors in release notes</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s pretty much it. That’s great for the people who have already secured positions through seniority, or because they’re amazing C hackers. I don’t know if I need to lay out for everyone the value of public recognition – if you want me to I can enumerate them. But the benefits of public recognition are huge — both in a social and a financial sense.</p>
<p>Currently, the only way I know of to be recognized for work on Postgres that is <em>not</em> seniority or code-related is #1. If you’re a reviewer, there’s almost no chance you’ll be recognized in our list of contributors without some additional, very significant contribution to our community. (Please let me know if I’m mistaken about this — I only know what I know!) Adding names to Release Notes (or some variant of Release Notes) seems like a minor concession for work that we as a community need, value and want to encourage.</p>
<p>We are so few in terms of patch contributors – somewhere between 300-400 people contribute code to PostgreSQL each year based on the names I try to pull out of commits. I haven’t counted how many reviewers we have who do not also contribute patches separately.</p>
<p>Giving people appreciation for the review work they’re doing, for free, is a good thing for everyone. Naming more names helps describe the true scope of our community. Spreading gratitude is good for those who thank and those who receive thanks (like, proven scientifically!). And we increase the number of people who benefit directly from the work that they do here, by giving them something they can point their boss, their company and their colleagues to.</p>
<p>So, when we’re debating <em>how</em> recognition might be done, please don’t lose sight of <em>why</em> this is important in the first place.</p>" nil nil "b7791407008fcd81540e2e7720a1432b") (226 (20949 15560 756122) "http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2013/the-tale-of-selenium-bug-141.html" "David Burns: The tale of Selenium bug 141" nil "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 09:49:06 +0000" "<p>The selenium project has for a while now wanted to create a library that allows user emulation in the browser. The project has done a reasonable job at this so far with respect to this. We check if items are in the DOM, we check the visibility of items and we normalise text from the browser, amongst our other amazing talents!
</p><p>Our default position is we enforce the idea of emulation. \"How would a user do this action?\" is the main question we ask ourselves! So when a bug that doesn't meet that we tend not to implement it. One of these times is bug 141 - WebDriver lacks HTTP response header and status code methods. This is one of the most contentious bugs in the Selenium repository. People see Selenium as more than browser automation library, they see it as a web testing framework. Yes, Selenium RC was like this but then again Selenium RC also had ~140 methods hung off one object. We made a mistake in the past, let's try not to repeat it! Anyway, I digress,  in a web testing framework world there may be times where there are use cases where you need to find out data from the response header and status codes.
</p><p>So is this a feature we want to add to WebDriver? No. \"But David, we do!?!?!?\" I hear you cry! The use case that comes up regularly is I want to know if a server is returning a 404 or 500 when I access a page. Why is there a need to start a browser to find this out? When I asked this question on twitter, my friend and fellow committer Kevin Menard said that it could be useful to to see the page response on failure and some pages can only be accessed with a real browser. The use cases that Kevin had is you want to check that the endpoint that you originally hit might might change based on the user agent passed in or there might be a site that follows the single page idea and breaks push state and therefore most of the web semantics. I admit Kevin is right with those use cases. However its only looking at a small part of the issue and there are a lot of corner cases. The major one for me is watching XHRs. What if one of your XHR returns a 500 and you get an error? Should WebDriver show you that information as well? I am sure you can see how quickly this can escalate. If you start worrying about all requests, and you should if you are worried about the initial request to a page, then you want the browser to capture all of this information and return it in a standard format. There just happens to be a format called Http Archive (HAR).
</p><p>So does the project take the task of creating a mechanism for extracting a HAR from the browser? That could be near impossible on browsers that don't readily share network usage information. So we go from WebDriver being a browser automation framework for user emulation to browser automation framework for user emulation and networking information gathering. That might be a little obtuse but its meant to be.
</p><p>While Selenium's main use case is for test automation, is not solely designed for that. We want to be the best at browser automation. Proxies are really good at managing network information and reporting on it in standard formats. Examples are fiddler and browsermob-proxy. And you can even hook them into Selenium WebDriver! Like the following:
</p><p></p><pre class=\"brush: python\">from browsermobproxy import Server
server = Server(\"path/to/browsermob-proxy\")
server.start()
proxy = server.create_proxy()
from selenium import webdriver
profile  = webdriver.FirefoxProfile()
profile.set_proxy(proxy.selenium_proxy())
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile)
proxy.new_har(\"google\")
driver.get(\"http://www.google.co.uk\")
proxy.har # returns a HAR JSON blob
server.stop()
driver.quit()
</pre>
<p>Yes it might be a little verbose to use them but if you really want to see that type of information then you should do it properly otherwise the real errors, that you originally wanted, will go missing.
</p><p>Putting in half a solution into Selenium is just going to create scope creep and a large number of bugs because its not doing the \"right\" thing. The \"right\" thing is far too subjective for it to be done correctly.</p>" nil nil "4bea25f09a894647343594ac869e1200") (225 (20949 15560 752338) "http://oduinn.com/blog/2013/06/26/release-engineering-as-a-force-multiplier-at-google-techtalks/" "John O'Duinn: =?utf-8?Q?=E2=80=9CRelease?= Engineering as a Force =?utf-8?Q?Multiplier=E2=80=9D?= at Google TechTalks" "John" "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 08:31:51 +0000" "<p>I was super honored to present as part of the Google TechTalks series.

<h3>Add-on Pathfinder</h3>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>I’ve created this repository for a lot of reasons, and that is always the best one. It’s not worth going through them all however, so here are the ones worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the Add-on SDK needs a place where people can contribute to experimental modules rapidly, this means everything should happen on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a>, tests are optional, and auto-repacks are not an issue. I don’t think the SDK should become this, in my eyes the SDK should be the land of stable modules, and Pathfinder would be a land of experimental or nearly stable modules.</li>
<li>I feel I do my best work in a bottom-up design approach, which is how I see Pathfinder growing, I see the SDK as being developed in the opposite manner which has merits as well, such as stability. I am just one person tho and stability is just not something that I can offer for my range of modules, so I don’t feel that is the right approach for me. Teams have much greatly ability to offer stability.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>APIs will change in the Pathfinder, modules may move around too, be forewarned!</p>
<p>When this happens I will blog about it, and I’ll probably start a wiki page about this kind of thing too so that everyone has a reference that they can check.</p>
<p>Documentation badly needs updating..</p>
<p>I’m telling you all about Pathfinder now, despite the obvious need of work because I have abondoned the old repositories, and fixed many bugs in Pathfinder already which I have no intention of back porting.</p>

I've never been passionate about being a people manager, and I've always looked to reduce or eliminate that part of my role, but our pace of hiring always outstripped my ability to send my direct reports to other managers.

</li></ul>
<p>Over the coming weeks I’d like to introduce some of the key concepts as well as some of the issues that need your input.</p>
<p>First, I’d like to give an overview of where the spec comes from and what it covers.</p>
<h3>Why Web Animations? A summary of happenings until now</h3>
<p>On the Web today we have <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/\">CSS Animation</a> (including <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/\">Transitions</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html\">SVG Animation</a> and they both have their problems. For example, CSS is so simple it doesn’t even support synchronization and SVG is pretty hairy when it comes to interval negotiation and syncbase timing—and it’s SVG-only. Most of all though, they’re completely separate.</p>
<p>Also, Microsoft don’t support SVG Animation. They have consistently maintained that they want to see a single model for animation on the Web (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2011/03/02-svg-irc#T22-19-34\">minutes</a>) and that that model should have an API. That’s a very reasonable position in my mind, albeit frustrating for authors who want to use SVG Animation now.</p>
<p>The story since then is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>On several occasions throughout 2011 and 2012 I proposed various alternatives (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/F2F/Auckland_2011/Animation_improvements\">#1</a> – <a href=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/pres/SVG 2 Animation.html\">presentation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/F2F/Seattle_2011/Agenda/Animations/Harmonisation\">#2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/F2F/Sydney_2012/Agenda/Animations/WebAnimations\">#3</a>) for harmonizing the two such as importing SVG features into CSS and vice versa. People mostly just nodded in agreement and nothing happened.
</li><li>In January 2012, Adobe wisely suggested I <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2012/01/13-svg-irc#T23-14-43\">go away and prepare a concrete proposal</a> so people can get a feel for what is might look like. Adobe also offered to assist where they could.
</li><li>At the end of January 2012 I invited a contact from Google to join in since he had some great ideas about state machines.
</li><li>In March 2012 folks from Adobe, Google and I (Mozilla) got together in Tokyo and hacked out a first version of the spec.
</li><li>In May 2012 we <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fx/2012AprJun/0107.html\">got approval from the CSS and SVG working groups</a> to continue this work as an official work item.
</li><li>In September 2012 we presented a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvNQNtIfXXI\">demo of the work</a> at the <a href=\"http://svgopen.org/2012/\">Graphical Web conference in Zurich</a> (<a href=\"http://www.multimedia.ethz.ch/conferences/2012/svgopen/05-1_thursday?doi=10.3930/ETHZ/AV-f8a1c756-a4de-4e64-98f5-c2c0b90bc9af&autostart=false\">video recording</a>).
</li><li>In June 2013 we <a href=\"http://logs.csswg.org/irc.w3.org/css/?date=2013-06-04\">got approval from the CSS and SVG working groups</a> to publish a FPWD.
</li><li>Today (25 June 2013) we finally <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/\">published something</a>!

<dt><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#grouping-and-synchronization\">Timing groups</a></dt>
<dd>This is the primary means of synchronization.<br />
It’s quite powerful but I’ll leave the details and justification for this to a separate post.</dd>
<dt>Speed control (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#speed-control\">#1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#timed-item-speed-control\">#2</a>)</dt>
<dd>This is a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/SVG2_Requirements_Input#SMIL_time_manipulation_module\">requested feature for SVG2</a> and may be useful for achieving reversing effects such as exposed in CSS.</dd>
<dt><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#custom-effects\">Custom effects</a> (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#the-customeffect-callback-interface\">API</a>)</dt>
<dd>This allows the Web Animations timing model to be used to drive animations of HTML canvas etc. by registering a script callback.</dd>
<dt><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#dfn-iteration-start\">Iteration start</a></dt>
<dd>This is a minor but much requested feature that allows you to start an animation part-way through its interval.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>What’s <em>not</em> included?</h3>
<p>Bear in mind that Web Animations is essentially a model. It’s not a declarative syntax. That’s something left to other specs. The API <em>happens</em> to be bundled with the model simply because that makes it easy to keep the two in sync.</p>
<p>The arrangement is as follows:</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">
<img alt=\"Intersection of features provided by CSS, SVG, and Web Animations\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Animations-and-other-specs.png\" />
</div>
<p>The CSS-specific features required for CSS animations and transitions will be covered in a separate specification, possibly called “CSS Animations/Transitions level 4” which expresses its features in terms of the Web Animations model.</p>
<p>Likewise, current SVG features such as syncbase timing, or targetting attributes (not just CSS properties) will be covered by a separate specification (my next task) expressed in terms of that model. That specification may be called something like “SVG Animation” but I suspect not since quite a few people have expressed interest in allowing it to apply to HTML content too.</p>
<p>Other features that are not included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bounce/spring timing functions</strong> – we really wanted to make this possible and have a couple of simple extensions to timing functions to allow this but we haven’t yet reached agreement about which one is best so we’re leaving them both out for now.<br />
The plan is to follow up with a separate specification which provides additional timing functions anyway.<br />
(In fact, with the current working draft, you can’t even do more than one timing function over an animation currently but that will be fixed in the next draft when we introduce chained timing functions).<p></p>
</li><li><strong>Media integration</strong> – this is something a lot of people have been asking for but we decided to postpone it in the interests of progressing the spec along.<br />
The good news is this <em>used</em> to be part of the spec so we know it integrates very cleanly.<br />
For now we’ll work on it in a separate spec and if that comes along quickly enough we might merge it back in.<p></p>
</li><li><strong>State machines</strong> – this is something that is very useful when you start programming UI interactions but something we decided is not critical for the first version of the spec.<br />
Again, we’ll probably work on this as a separate spec.
</li></ul>
<h3>API?</h3>
<p>Originally I opposed the idea of adding an API because I think declarative solutions are generally preferable. However, the API is useful in a few cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>It lets you inspect the state of all animations in the document. Anyone can build developer tools that present you with a timeline of all the running CSS animations/transitions/SVG animations in the document for debugging.
</li><li>It lets you make runtime changes to declarative animations—for many apps a combination of declarative and procedural approaches is the best fit and lets you achieve effects that might not be possible using purely declarative features.
</li><li>For some problems a procedural approach is suitable and in those cases using the API is both simpler than writing the animation loop yourself and also means the browser can optimise the animation for smoother performance and less battery consumption.
</li></ul>
<h3>Implementations?</h3>
<p><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/blink-dev/web$20animations/blink-dev/jDjDMTuKegI/Uh1qz44DSBsJ\">Work has started on implementation in Blink</a> and is <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875219\">on the radar for Gecko</a>. Until then <a href=\"https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js\">a polyfill</a> is coming along in leaps and bounds and covers nearly all of the FPWD.</p>
<p>That’s it for now. I’ll follow up with posts explaining specific features and issues needing input but if you have any feedback on the spec, don’t hesitate to send it along to <a href=\"mailto:public-fx@w3.org\">public-fx@w3.org</a> with subject <q>[web-animations]</q>.

<p>The following is my personal take on (a small portion of) the Persona market strategy.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Persona’s #1 selling feature is privacy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This was a guiding <b>design principle</b>, no doubt about it. It <b>absolutely</b> is not our #1 <b>selling</b> feature.</p>
<p>Our team wants to help mainstream users. Sadly, privacy (and security) aren’t their main concern.</p>
<p>Johannes makes some great points around Google’s use of OpenID, that losing information about where their users are going might be a negative in evaluating Persona.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Our team has focused on the following stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Websites – Relaying Parties (RP)
</li><li>Email providers – Identity Providers (IdP)
</li><li>Browser Vendors
</li><li>People using the web (Users)
</li></ul>
<p>For each of these, deep focus was put into the value proposition and finding the right balance in the technical details.</p>
<p>I’ve never been on such a <b>large scale Open Source project</b> that focused on <b>User Centered Design, Marketing, and Security</b>.</p>
<p>Let’s take IdPs which is Johannes’ main problem. If an IdP were to adopt Persona, they would get the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizations have the ability to control the security parameters for their domain
</li><li>Brand recognition on websites which use Persona.
</li><li>A SSO-like experience for enterprise, schools, and communities.
</li></ul>
<p>Without native IdP support, an organization that controls an SMTP routable domain name is subject to the email + password of the Persona fallback. They cannot add 2 factor auth. By running an IdP they can use Yubi-keys, RSA thumbdrives, or SMS verification… whatever.</p>
<p>Once they control the security, they would be more inclined to use Persona across their family of websites. This integration is much easier than traditional methods and lowers expenses.</p>
<p>The brand recognition comes by controlling the login screen. They get this today with OpenID and OAuth which I will call “Social Login” to simplify the argument. Social Login isn’t applicable to every RP.</p>
<p>We think that adding <a href=\"http://www.guanotronic.com/~serge/papers/chi13a.pdf\" title=\"My Profile Is My Password, Verify Me!<br /> The Privacy/Convenience Tradeoff of Facebook Connect by Serge Egelman\">Facebook Connect filters out 15% of your new users</a>. (We’d love to do a study and get reliable numbers here).</p>
<p>There is a long tail of websites which can’t use Social Login and will do authentication themselves. We think that Persona is viable for many of these websites. Thus a company can further spread their brand.</p>
<p>I agree with Johannes that Google won’t be the first large IdP. I don’t think that means Persona is irrelevant or destined to fail. Universities, email providers, and enterprise can improve their users security and smooth out login flows. Identity startups can start with a solid protocol and get Browser/Website integration for free.</p>
<h3>The IdP is Only One Stakeholder</h3>
<p>Those reasons are just some of the value propositions balanced against other factors during the design of Persona’s BrowserID protocol.</p>
<p>For RPs, there is a set. Here are a couple:</p>
<ul>
<li>No platform/vendor lockin (email based)
</li><li>Easy to implement (lower cost)
</li><li>Works across devices
</li><li>Improves security (DROP COLUMN password)
</li><li>Consistent sign in across the web
</li><li>Lower cost of authentication system (forgot your password, remove sending email for verification and forgot your password, etc)
</li></ul>
<p>Again this list is non exhaustive and I haven’t touched upon Browser Vendor or User value propositions which have been designed for.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I agree with Johannes that some businesses will avoid Persona early on. Perhaps they want a Facebook Connect sign in for extended profile information and social graph.</p>
<p>That is fine.</p>
<p>Persona can help a lot of people use the web in an easy to use and more secure manner. It doesn’t have to be everybody on day one <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://ozten.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<p>Johannes, you have a long history in this space. From meeting you, I know you care about user sovereignty (and many other important factors). Thanks for helping us find adoption problems with Persona.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was told that, as a Mozilla employee, I could get a free <strong><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/\">Firefox OS</a></strong> phone. There were two caveats: it’s a developer preview, so it’s rough around the edges; and I’d have to ‘dogfood’ it – using it as my ‘daily driver’ and providing feedback to developers. I considered it for a while, flirted with the idea of an Android device, and then took the plunge last week. Since last Wednesday I’ve been using the <strong><a href=\"http://www.geeksphone.com/\">Geeksphone Keon</a></strong> as my main phone.</p>
<p><img alt=\"Firefox OS box\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36058\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ffos-box.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>Firefox OS is aimed primarily at the next billion web users, people who will experience the web for the first time through a mobile device. Instead of closed, proprietary platforms (or pseudo-open ones) the idea is that the entire ‘stack’ is open and easy to develop for. If you know HTML, CSS and JavaScript then you can create an app for a Firefox OS device. As someone who felt extremely empowered as a 16 year-old creating his first website, that’s something that certainly resonates with me.</p>
<p>Because of the aims of the Firefox OS ecosystem, the developer preview reference device (the Keon) is a pretty low-spec phone for 2013. The idea being, of course, that if an app runs smoothly on the reference device then it will run well on other devices. Although there’s some occasional lag, it’s a pretty slick experience – which makes me wonder what those quad-core beasts are doing with that extra processing power?</p>
<p>It would be disingenuous of me to pretend that the Keon does everything an iPhone or Android device does. Of course it doesn’t. I miss posting to Path, running with Nike+ and adding notes to Evernote. But to dismiss it based on current conceptions of what a mobile device should be would, I think, miss the point. It’s the first phone I’ve ever had that allows me to tick a ‘Do Not Track’ option, for example. <img alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> </p>
<p>This post is to ensure that you know someone who you can ask questions about Firefox OS. I’ll keep you updated as to my progress!</p>

"mbest" "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 17:07:52 +0000" "<p dir=\"ltr\">Firefox 22 is now released, and I am very excited!  One of its key features is a new set of optimizations for asm.js, a highly optimizable subset of JavaScript.  asm.js was developed by Mozilla while working jointly with game industry leaders to find a path to port high performance C++ games to the Web.  That, however, is only the start of what it can do.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two main use cases that asm.js addresses.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">The first is bringing full native applications to the Web.  Using a tool called <a href=\"http://emscripten.org\">Emscripten</a>, C++ code can be cross-compiled to JavaScript, specifically the asm.js subset.  It integrates well with existing tool chains, as we have demonstrated by porting <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/03/27/mozilla-is-unlocking-the-power-of-the-web-as-a-platform-for-gaming/\">Unreal Engine 3 to the web in 4 days</a>.  That’s an incredible achievement considering we ported over a million lines of code.  This accomplishment provides a smooth path towards publishing existing applications on the Web, or for treating the Web as a platform alongside traditional desktop and console targets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another route is using asm.js and Emscripten to port libraries that require significant computing power.  HTML5 game developers sometimes find it hard to achieve an acceptable user experience should they seek to include performance intensive elements such as physics or pathfinding in their game.  This often leads to developers needing to optimize every bit of their game just to get something workable.  asm.js makes including these intensive elements more practical.  You can now use an asm.js compiled library, such as <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/ammo.js/examples/new/ammo.html\">Bullet</a> or <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/box2d.js/webgl_demo/box2d.html\">Box2d</a> for physics, to supercharge the 5%-10% of the code that does most of the work and write the rest by hand using traditional JavaScript.  This approach gives you the speed of near-native execution where you need it and the ease and flexibility of modern JavaScript everywhere else.  Emscripten provides the needed capabilities for creating coder friendly interfaces for asm.js libraries to make them easy to interact with.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/ammo.js/examples/new/ammo.html\"><img alt=\"Screen-Shot-2013-06-25-at-2.11.19-AM\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-49\" height=\"136\" src=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/mbest/files/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-25-at-2.11.19-AM-300x136.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is not limited to games.  The performance it can bring to web applications opens up many interesting possibilities for speeding up existing web tasks, or bringing new experiences to the Web.  Efforts to port video decoders and <a href=\"http://blog.bitops.com/\">photo processing tools</a> using asm.js are also seeing performance increases from taking advantage of existing C++ code without plugins or browser-specific technology.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">There have been several attempts to provide a solution for C++ developers wishing to target the Web.  We believe asm.js is the best solution, and here are a few of our reasons why:</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">1.  It’s just JavaScript.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is compatible with existing browsers.  Emscripten cross-compiled code requires Typed Arrays, a feature that is well-supported by modern browsers today, including Internet Explorer. There is no need to wait years for the technology to spread, or take the risk that it never will.  Furthermore, asm.js is a formalization of a pattern of JavaScript that web browsers have already been optimizing for, namely compiled C/C++ as generated by Emscripten and Mandreel, and a sample of that type of code appears in a popular benchmark, Google Octane.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">2. It’s fast.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to all of the work browsers have already done to optimize JavaScript in general and compiled C++ in particular (in part due to such code appearing in Octane), it is very easy for browser vendors to optimize for it and unlock its full potential — it took a single Mozilla developer about 3 months to implement <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Javascript:SpiderMonkey:OdinMonkey\">OdinMonkey</a>, our asm.js optimization module for Firefox.  Google developers also quickly achieved large speedups on asm.js, as reported in their <a href=\"http://news.softpedia.com/news/Chrome-May-Support-Mozilla-s-Asm-js-for-Native-Speed-Web-Apps-354281.shtml\">IO keynote</a>. In just a short time it is possible to get to about half the native speed of C++.  That’s faster than Java, in the case of Box2D.  That is just the first draft – we expect to get much closer to native performance with additional development on the browser side.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">3. It dramatically reduces the cost of supporting the Web.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">For developers already working with C++, Emscripten makes the Web just another port target.  Once it’s integrated into your tool chain, the web version can be recompiled alongside your other platforms whenever any updates are needed.  We have ported full properties in very short time periods.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">4. It reduces or eliminates the need for plugins.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">Companies that turn to plugins to enable their games or applications often see a significant friction in user adoption due to security warnings.  asm.js provides an alternative path that eliminates the security messaging issue while still providing much of the performance, all within a safe execution environment.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">5. It enables reuse of existing C++ libraries.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">There is a wealth of open source C++ libraries out there waiting to come over to the Web.  This is a vast amount of coding effort whose value has now been unlocked for web developers.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is still a new technology, and we have plenty of work to do to provide its full potential to the developer community.  Mozilla is grateful to Epic and other game industry leaders that have already started to work on products using asm.js.  These early <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">examples</a> are helping to prove the value, shape the technology, and encourage other browsers to priorities optimizations for it.  The best way to help support the development of asm.js is to start using it and let us know what you think by adding comments to this post.  If you are a game developer or have a performance intensive application and choose to port it over, share your work with the world and let us know about it!</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">For an in-depth look into what asm.js is and isn’t, have a look at this <a href=\"http://mozakai.blogspot.ca/2013/06/what-asmjs-is-and-what-asmjs-isnt.html\">post</a> by Alon Zakai.

I really love the orange colour though, somehow looks like it's made for the Dutch market already. Only 3 physical buttons, 1 power and 2 for volume. Furthermore the normal necessary things, microphone, speaker, headphone- and powerconnection.<br /><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sRvub1t1n2A/Ucl0Y8NjFyI/AAAAAAAAALI/YqMcGHIU4V0/s1600/20130624_185535.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sRvub1t1n2A/Ucl0Y8NjFyI/AAAAAAAAALI/YqMcGHIU4V0/s640/20130624_185535.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />So let's get started, where's the rest? Well, that's well hidden away in the triangular box behind the phone.<br /><br />All the things to get started and make the phone usefull, like battery, powercable, headphone, manual and some swag. The cover removes easily for placing the battery and I decided to place my SIM-card and SD-card too.

Being used to a Galaxy S2, I miss the menu and back-button, they don't exist. There is only a Home-button outside the screen in the middle below, menu- and back-buttons are presented on the screen itself depending on the application you started.

I’ve been paying special attention to the time required to reach the “first paint” startup milestone: the point in time when the first Firefox window becomes visible.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The analysis has mostly consisted of profiling the latest Firefox Nightlies using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Performance/Profiling_with_Xperf\">XPerf</a> on a reference dual-core Windows 7 laptop with a magnetic HDD. I’ve been working on several bugs arising from the investigation (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881575\">bug 881575</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881578\">bug 881578</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=827976\">bug 827976</a>,  <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=879957\">bug 879957</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=873640\">bug 873640</a>) and I have many more coming. This is an overview of a few challenges I’ve run into over the last month.</p>
<h3>Making Startup Times Reproducible</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wanted to evaluate the impact of my experimental code changes by comparing startups, but I quickly discovered that there is a tremendous amount of variation in startup times in my test environment. I then turned off <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefetcher\">Windows Prefetching</a> & <a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/windows-vista-superfetch-and-readyboostanalyzed,1532-2.html\">Windows SuperFetch</a>, two performance features responsible for pre-fetching files from disk based on the user’s usage patterns, but I still recorded excessive variation in start times.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I then turned off a plethora of 3rd-party and Windows services that were running in the background and accessing the disk: Windows Update & Indexing Service, OEM “boot optimizer” software, Flash & Chrome automatic updaters, graphics card configuration & monitoring software bundled with drivers, etc. After rebooting the laptop several times and disabling any remaining programs causing disk activity, I was finally able to achieve reproducible startup times. I expected that cold starts would be dominated by disk I/O, but I was suprised by just how heavily I/O operations dominated startup time in a vanilla Firefox install.</p>
<h3>Startup time has improved almost 30% over the last year</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In an attempt to reproduce the startup regression reported in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=818257\">bug 818257</a>, I compared time to first paint for Firefox 13.0.1 and Firefox 21.0 using my test setup. To my surprise, I found Firefox 21.0 (current release channel) requires roughly 4.6 seconds to reach first paint during cold starts, while Firefox 13.0.1 (release channel from a year ago) required ~6.4 seconds! This is almost a 30% reduction in startup time.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aq4ElA0owpEbdDhMNjh0V3pDT09Hck82UnZRaWJRTXc&single=true&gid=0&output=html\">See the raw results from 5 runs in a Google Docs spreadsheet here</a></p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was surprised by this result because I expected increases in code size and the overhead from initializing new components added over the course of a year to cause regressions in startup. On the other hand, many people have landed patches to improve startup by postponing component initialization and generally reducing the amount of work done before the first-paint milestone. I haven’t tried to identify the patches responsible yet, but from a quick look at the XPerf profiles for each version, it looks like there were gains from fixing <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=756313\">bug 756313</a>  (“Don’t load homepage before first paint”) and from changing the list of Mozilla libraries pre-loaded at startup (see <em>dependentlibs.list</em>).</p>
<h3>We are still FSYNC-ing too much at startup</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apparently, the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364439%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\">FlushFileBuffers</a> function on Windows causes the OS  to flush everything in the write-back cache as it <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ce_base/archive/2006/03/15/increasefsthroughput.aspx\">“does not know what part of the cache belongs to your file”</a>. As you can imagine, calling FlushFileBuffers is bad news for Firefox startups even it’s done off the main thread — other I/O requests will be delayed while the disk is busy writing data. Unfortunately we are currently calling this method on browser startup to write out the <em>webapps.json</em> file, the <em>sessionstore.js</em> file, and several SafeBrowsing files. The flush method isn’t being called directly, rather it’s the <em>SafeFileOutputStream</em> and <em>OS.File.writeAtomic()</em> implementations that force flushes for maximum reliability. In general, we should avoid calling methods that fsync/FlushFileBuffers unless such reliability is explicitly required, and I’ve asked <a href=\"http://dutherenverseauborddelatable.wordpress.com/\">Yoric</a> to change <em>OS.File.writeAtomic()</em> behavior to forego flushing by default.</p>
<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next steps</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’m continuing to work on reducing the number of DLL loads triggered at startup and I’ll soon be filing bugs for fixing some of the smaller sources of startup I/O.</p>" nil nil "1954a5ee46b0a3460378b1a531e41c23") (214 (20949 15560 739001) "https://staktrace.com/spout/entry.php?id=800" "Kartikaya Gupta: Unraveling coordinate systems" "stak" "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 03:28:21 +0000" "<p class=\"blogEntry\">For the last few weeks I've been hacking away at a jungle of coordinate systems in the graphics code, trying to make code easier to understand and to work with. This work is technically part of the effort to make subframes asynchronously scrollable in OMTC, but it has helped us to fix other bugs as well. This post a braindump of the coordinate systems I've uncovered and the mental model I have.
<br />
<br />As of this writing, I have defined four \"pixel\" types in <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/Units.h\">layout/base/Units.h</a>. These are CSSPixel, LayoutDevicePixel, LayerPixel, and ScreenPixel. CSSPixel is the simplest - it represents a CSS pixel, which is what web content authors use to specify dimensions of things. Almost every Web API [1] deals with CSS pixels.
<br />
<br />In the days of yore, 1 CSS pixel corresponded exactly to one screen pixel. That is, when you created a div that was 50 CSS pixels wide, it would show up as 50 pixels wide on your screen. If you have a desktop monitor that is 1024 pixels wide [2] and you create a div that is 1024 CSS pixels wide, it takes up your entire monitor width. Makes sense, right?
<br />
<br />Now, let us enter the world of HiDPI display devices. On HiDPI devices, the screen pixels are so small and packed together so tightly that mapping 1 CSS pixel to 1 screen pixel doesn't make sense any more. Sure, you can fit more on the screen, but it's too tiny to be readable or useful. So we have this concept of a widget scale. The <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/xpwidgets/nsBaseWidget.cpp#l421\">nsIWidget::GetDefaultScale()</a> returns a scaling factor to account for HiDPI displays. For example, see the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/gonk/nsWindow.cpp#l557\">gonk implementation</a> which makes B2G perform a scale amount based on the actual DPI of the device. This introduces a new coordinate system that layout refers to as \"device pixels\" and what I've called LayoutDevicePixels.
<br />
<br />In the layout code, the widget scale affects two main things. One is the size of the CSS viewport [3]. If we have a widget scale of 2.0, then each CSS pixel is 2 screen pixels wide, which means that on a 1024x768 screen with a maximized browser window, you can only fit 512 CSS pixels across. So the CSS viewport width is adjusted to account for this. The other is the scale factor from app units [4] to screen pixels. Instead of the usual 60 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel you would normally get, setting a 2.0 widget scale results in 30 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel. This effectively makes each CSS pixel twice as wide when being rendered to the screen, which is the point of the whole exercise.
<br />
<br />But that's not all! There is another factor that comes into play between CSS pixels and LayoutDevicePixels, and that is the \"<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsPresContext.cpp#l1399\">full zoom</a>\". This is when, on desktop Firefox, you perform the \"Zoom In\" or \"Zoom Out\" actions. Doing a \"Zoom In\" action increases the full zoom, which works almost identically to increasing the widget scale. That is, setting a zoom of 110% is pretty much equivalent to having a widget scale of 1.1. The only difference I'm aware of is that if you specify your CSS dimensions in real-world units such as inches, then they are affected by the widget scale but not by the \"full zoom\". Tricksy!
<br />
<br />So to summarize what we have so far: in a world with just CSSPixels and LayoutDevicePixels, dimensions are specified in CSSPixels by content authors, and the browser maps them to LayoutDevicePixels based on the widget scale and full zoom. These LayoutDevicePixels are then displayed 1:1 on screen pixels as defined by the underlying platform.
<br />
<br />But what about mobile? Welcome to the land of OMTC and pinch-zoom. OMTC stands for off-main-thread compositor, and is what allows you to pinch a page on Fennec and have it instantly zoom. What's happening here is the painted page is transformed in OpenGL [5], without Gecko really knowing about what's going on. Since Gecko isn't repainting anything, this is super fast, and allows us to animate pinch-zoom at 60 frames per second (or close to it).
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, it also introduces a new coordinate system, because the LayoutDevicePixels that Gecko produced are no longer displayed 1:1 on the screen. Gecko could have painted something 10 LayoutDevicePixels wide (and so the texture uploaded to the graphics hardware would be 10 pixels wide) but then the user does a pinch-zoom and BAM! now it's taking up 20 pixels on the screen, because we told OpenGL to scale it up by 2x. So here we have our third pixel type defined: the ScreenPixel. In the preceding example the pinch-zoom produced a scale factor of 2.0 and so 10 LayoutDevicePixels would get mapped to 20 ScreenPixels.
<br />
<br />Now say you're viewing a page in Fennec and zoom in using pinch-zoom. And then you zoom in some more. And then some more. If all we did was take the LayoutDevicePixels and tell OpenGL to render them bigger by scaling it in hardware, you would end up with a very pixellated and blurry view of the page. In order to make it look good again, we have to go back to Gecko and tell it to repaint the visible area of the page at a higher density, allowing us to remove the OpenGL scaling. For example, instead of rendering a paragraph of text into a texture and scaling that up in OpenGL to display a single word really big, we can tell Gecko to just render that one word really big, and to use up the entire texture to do it. This is done by a call to <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsIPresShell.h#l1217\">nsIPresShell::SetResolution()</a>.
<br />
<br />Setting the resolution doesn't change our definition of CSSPixels or LayoutDevicePixels, but it does change something. To describe this change, we need to introduce a new coordinate system. This is the LayerPixel [6], and it sits between LayoutDevicePixel and ScreenPixel. That is, the resolution changes how many LayerPixels are produced for each LayoutDevicePixel, and now pinch-zooming affects the scale between LayerPixels and ScreenPixels. This is a little cyclical because as you perform a pinch-zoom, LayerPixels and ScreenPixels get farther apart in size. Then, once you finish the zoom, we tell Gecko to re-render the content at a new resolution such that LayerPixels and ScreenPixels are the same size once again, and we render the new LayerPixels at a 1:1 scale on the screen. When this happens the visible content goes from being blurry back to being sharp, which you can see in Fennec if you pay close attention when zooming in.
<br />
<br />So to summarize, here is what we have now:
<br />CSSPixel x widget scale x full zoom = LayoutDevicePixel
<br />LayoutDevicePixel x resolution = LayerPixel
<br />LayerPixel x OMTC transforms = ScreenPixel
<br />
<br />And so ends my braindump. Hopefully what I've written above will not change going forward, and the terms I've used can become part of the Gecko developer vocabulary, so that when dealing with code in different coordinate systems it's much easier to agree on what we mean.
<br />
<br />Notes:
<br />[1] <strike>The only exception I can think of is window.outerWidth, which is in screen pixels.</strike> (Edit 2013-06-27: I was wrong, I think outerWidth is also in CSS pixels.)
<br />[2] Note that the number of screen pixels displayed on a physical device may be modified by the operating system. For example, you can change your screen resolution from 1024x768 to 800x600, which changes the size and number of screen pixels. That's fine - we don't need to account for that in our code as the OS takes care of it.
<br />[3] The CSS viewport affects how wide the page is laid out by the layout code. One way of visualizing this is that if you have a page with just plain text, the text will be wrapped so that it doesn't exceed the CSS viewport width.
<br />[4] App units are what layout does all of its calculations in. One app unit is exactly one-sixtieth of a CSS pixel. The \"60\" was chosen because it has many integer factors and so allows representing common fractions losslessly.
<br />[5] The actual graphics system in use depends on the platform. OpenGL is just an example.
<br />[6] When Gecko paints the various elements on a page, it flattens them into \"layers\" that it hands off to the graphics stack. This is where the term LayerPixel comes from.</p>" nil nil "ca9dd79ae40c9f5ae12a8b43fdb379c4") (213 (20949 15560 737329) "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/rawkes/~3/ElExNBV2GaY/vizicities-supported-by-simudyne" "Rob Hawkes: Announcing Simudyne as the first supporter of ViziCities" nil "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000" "<p>Wow, it's been an amazing few days!

and Chef has taken off in recent years. And rightly so - these
pieces of software make the lives of countless system
administrators much better (in theory).</p>
<p>In their default (and common) configuration, these pieces of
software do a terrific job of ensuring a machine is provisioned with
<em>today's</em> configuration. However, for many server provisioning
scenarios, we actually care about <em>yesterday's</em> configuration.</p>
<p>In this post, I will talk about the importance of time when configuring
machines.</p>
<h3>Describing the problem</h3>
<p>If you've worked on any kind of server application, chances are
you've had to deal with a rollback. Some new version of a package
or web application is rolled out to production. However, due to
unforeseen problems, it needed to be rolled back.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps you operate a farm of machines that continuously build
or compile software from version control. It's desirable to be able
to reproduce the output from a previous build (ideally bit
identical).</p>
<p>In these scenarios, the wall time plays a crucial rule when dealing
with a central, master configuration server (such as a Puppet
master).</p>
<p>Since a client will always pull the latest revision of its
configuration from the server, it's very easy to define your
configurations such that the result of machine provisioning
today is different from yesterday (or last week or last month).</p>
<p>For example, let's say you are running Puppet to manage a machine
that sits in a continuous integration farm and recompiles a source
tree over and over. In your Puppet manifest you have:</p>
<pre><code>package {
\"gcc\":
ensure => latest
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you run Puppet today, you may pull down GCC 4.7 from the remote
package repository because 4.7 is the latest version available. But
if you run Puppet tomorrow, you may pull down GCC 4.8 because the
package repository has been updated! If for some reason you need
to rebuild one of today's builds tomorrow (perhaps you want to
rebuild that revision plus a minor patch), they'll use different
compiler versions (or any package for that matter) and the output
may not be consistent - it may not even work at all! So much for
repeatability.</p>
<p>File templates are another example. In Puppet, file templates are
evaluated on the server and the results are sent to the client. So,
the output of file template execution today might be different from
the output tomorrow. If you needed to roll back your server to an
old version, you may not be able to do that because the template
on the server isn't backwards compatible! This can be worked around,
sure (commonly by copying the template and branching differences),
but over time these hacks accumulate in a giant pile of complexity.</p>
<p>The common issue here is that time has an impact on the outcome of
machine configuration. I refer to this issue as <strong>time-dependent
idempotency</strong>. In other words, does time play a role in the
supposedly idempotent configuration process? If the output is
consistent no matter <em>when</em> you run the configuration, it is
time-independent and truly idempotent. If it varies depending on
when configuration is performed, it is time-dependent and thus
not truly idempotent.</p>
<h3>Solving the problem</h3>
<p>My attitude towards machine configuration and automation is that
it should be as time independent as possible. If I need to revert
to yesterday's state or want to reproduce something that happened
months ago, I want strong guarantees that it will be similar, if not
identical. Now, this is just my opinion. I've worked in environments
where we had these strong guarantees. And having had this luxury,
I abhore the alternative where so many pieces of configuration vary
over time as the central configuration moves forward without the
ability to turn back the clock. As always, your needs may be
different and this post may not apply to you!</p>
<p>I said <em>as possible</em> a few times in the previous paragraph.
While you could likely make all parts of your configuration time
independent, it's not a good idea. In the real world, things
change over time and making all configuration data static regardless
of time will produce a broken or bad configuration.</p>
<p>User access is one such piece of configuration. Employees come and
go. Passwords and SSH keys change. You don't want to revert user
access to the way it was two months ago, restoring access to a
disgruntled former employee or allowing access via a compromised
password. Network configuration is another. Say the network topology
changed and the firewall rules need updating. If you reverted the
networking configuration, the machine likely wouldn't work on the

<p>This highlights an important fact: <strong>if making your machine
configuration time independent is a goal, you will need to
bifurcate configuration by time dependency and solve for both.</strong>
You'll need to identify every piece of configuration and
ask <em>do I put this in the bucket that is constant over time or
the bucket that changes over time?</em></p>
<p>Machine configuration software can do a terrific job of ensuring
an applied configuration is idempotent. The problem is it typically
can't manage both time-dependent and time-independent attributes
at the same time. Solving this requires a little brain power, but
is achievable if there is will. In the next section, I'll describe
how.</p>
<h4>Technical implementation</h4>
<p>Time-dependent machine configuration is a solved problem. Deploy
Puppet master (or similar) and you are good to go.</p>
<p>Time-independent configuration is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the first step is to isolate all of the
configuration you want to be time independent. Next, you need to
ensure time dependency doesn't creep into that configuration. You
need to identify things that can change over time and take
measures to ensure those changes won't affect the configuration.
I encourage you to employ the <em>external system
test</em>: <em>does this aspect of configuration depend on an external
system or entity? If so how will I prevent changes in it over
time from affecting us?</em></p>
<p>Package repositories are one such external system. New package
versions are released all the time. Old packages are deleted.
If your configuration says to install the <em>latest</em> package, there's
no guarantee the package version won't change unless the package
repository doesn't change. If you simply pin a package to a specific
version, that version may disappear from the server. The solution:
pin packages to specific versions <strong>and</strong> run your own package
mirror that doesn't delete or modify existing packages.</p>
<p>Does your configuration fetch a file from a remote server or use
a file as a template? Cache that file locally (in case it
disappears) and put it under version control. Have the configuration
reference the version control revision of that file. As long as the
repository is accessible, the exact version of the file can be
retrieved at any time without variation.</p>
<p>In my professional career, I've used two separate systems for
managing time-independent configuration data. Both relied heavily
on version control. Essentially, all the time-independent
configuration data is collected into a single repository - an
independent repository from all the time-dependent data
(although that's technically an implementation detail). For Puppet,
this would include all the manifests, modules, and files used
directly by Puppet. When you want to <em>activate</em> a machine with
a configuration, you simply say <em>check out revision X of this
repository and apply its configuration.</em> Since <em>revision X</em> of
the repository is constant over time, the set of configuration
data being used to configure the machine is constant. And, if
you've done things correctly, the output is idempotent over time.</p>
<p>In one of these systems, we actually had two versions of Puppet
running on a machine. First, we had the daemon communicating with a
central Puppet master. It was continually applying time-dependent
configuration (user accounts, passwords, networking, etc). We
supplemented this was a manually executed standalone Puppet
instance. When you ran a script, it asked the Puppet master for its
configuration. Part of that configuration was the revision of the
time-independent Git repository containing the Puppet configuration
files the client should use. It then pulled the Git repo, checked
out the specified revision, merged Puppet master's settings for the
node with that config (not the manifests, just some variables),
then ran Puppet locally to apply the configuration. While a
machine's configuration typically referenced a SHA-1 of a specific
Git commit to use, we could use anything <em>git checkout</em> understood.
We had some machines running <em>master</em> or other branches if we didn't
care about time-independent idempotency for that machine at that
time. What this all meant was that if you wanted to roll back
a machine's configuration, you simply specified an earlier Git
commit SHA-1 and then re-ran local Puppet.</p>
<p>We were largely satisfied with this model. We felt like we got
the best of both worlds. And, since we were using the same
technology (Puppet) for time-dependent and time-independent
configuration, it was a pretty simple-to-understand system.
A downside was there were two Puppet instances instead of one.
With a little effort, someone could probably devise a way for
the Puppet master to <em>merge</em> the two configuration trees. I'll
leave that as an exercise for the reader. Perhaps someone has
done this already! If you know of someone, please leave a comment!</p>
<h4>Challenges</h4>
<p>The solution I describe does not come without its challenges.</p>
<p>First, deciding whether a piece of configuration is time dependent
or time independent can be quiet complicated. For example,
should a package update for a critical security fix be time
dependent or time independent? It depends! What's the risk of
the machine not receiving that update? How often is that machine
rolled back? Is that package important to the operation/role
of that machine (if so, I'd lean more towards time independent).</p>
<p>Second, minimizing exposure to external entities is hard. While
I recommend putting as much as possible under version control in a
single repository and pinning versions everywhere when you interface
with an external system, this isn't always feasible. It's probably
a silly idea to have your 200 GB Apt repository under version
control and distributed locally to every machine in your network.
So, you end up introducing specialized one-off systems as necessary.
For our package repository, we just ran an internal HTTP server that
only allowed inserts (no deletes or mutates). If we were creative, we
could have likely devised a way for the client to pass a <em>revision</em> with
the request and have the server dynamically serve from that revision
of an underlying repository. Although, that may not work for every
server type due to limited control over client behavior.</p>
<p>Third, ensuring compatibility between the time-dependent configuration
and time-independent configuration is hard. This is a consequence of
separating those configurations. Will a time-independent configuration
from a revision two years ago work with the time-dependent
configuration of today? This issue can be mitigated by first
having as much configuration as possible be time independent and
second not relying on wide support windows. If it's good enough
to only support compatibility for time-independent configurations
less than a month old, then it's good enough! With this issue, I feel
you are trading long-term future incompatibility for well-defined
and understood behavior in the short to medium term. That's
a trade-off I'm willing to make.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Many machine configuration management systems only care about
idempotency <em>today</em>. However, with a little effort, it's possible
to achieve consistent state over time. This requires a little extra
effort and brain power, but it's certainly doable.</p>
<p>The next time you are programming your system configuration tool, I
hope you take the time to consider the effects time will have and that
you will take the necessary steps to ensure consistency over time
(assuming you want that, of course).</p>" nil nil "3b33c8b1684a94bc24ec7de7bba4f361") (211 (20949 15560 734025) "http://www.laurathomson.com/2013/06/ode-to-morgamic/" "Laura Thomson: Ode to Morgamic" "laura" "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 18:47:07 +0000" "<p>Mike Morgan - <a href=\"http://morgamic.com/\">morgamic</a> - was my boss for nearly six years. Friday was his last day working at Mozilla. I wanted to  write something to memorialize his departure, in the same way <a href=\"http://morgamic.com/2013/05/06/ode-to-james-socol/\">he did for  others</a>. Of course, this blog post will not be as eloquent as if he had  written it, but I will do my best.</p>
<p>There are two things that stand out about Morgamic: his leadership, and his passion for the Mozilla and the Open Web.</p>
<p>Morgamic  is that rare leader who, rather than rallying the troops from the  front, leads from beside you, encouraging you every step of the way. Morgamic is an introvert. Never let anyone tell you introverts can’t  lead. He excels at leadership because of his special talents for  introspection, reflection and the ability and willingness to listen.</p>
<p>He taught me, by example, and by teaching me to ask the right questions, three important things about leadership:</p>
<p>Enable autonomy by quiet leadership. In six years, I don’t think he  ever really told me to do anything. Like Confucius, he simply asked  questions that helped me figure it out for myself.</p>
<p>Trust people. I  can get really mad about things being done in a way I consider wrong.  He always encouraged me to ask myself why someone might be doing it that  way, and to trust that they were doing the best they could.</p>
<p>Reframe problems. Mike sees problems as complex and nuanced. It’s  never black or white: you just have to zoom out a little to see a  million solutions to a problem that you might not have seen before.</p>
<p>We  certainly had disagreements over the last few years, but  we always managed to resolve them in a constructive way, and that might  be the greatest lesson of all. As a technical leader, he goes out of his  way to hire people that he is confident are smarter than him, and he  never gets insecure about it. (In my case, I’m not sure he was right. He  certainly outdoes me in wisdom.) He coaches those people into  excellence. Morgamic is a force multiplier. Not only that, but he cares  about his people, and will go out of his way to help them develop into  the best and happiest versions of themselves.</p>
<p>Virtually every website you use at Mozilla was made with Morgamic’s  hands, Morgamic’s help, or Morgamic’s leadership. We still use code from  the first web app he ever built for Mozilla, when he was a volunteer:  Every time you update or download Firefox, you can do that because of  Morgamic.</p>
<p>Morgamic also has a vision and a passion for the Mozilla Mission and  the Open Web. If you’ve ever talked with him about it, you’ll know  exactly what I mean. With Mike, it always came back to two questions:  How does this move the mission forward? How does this benefit the Open  Web?</p>
<p>He also manages to bring humor and humanity into every action:  whether it’s org charts with Care Bears, photoshopping your head onto a  meerkat, or presenting interns with trophies at the end of the summer.  Once, when I had a sick pet and he knew I was really upset, he sent me a  giant bunch of flowers (’From the webdev team’). That made me cry,  quite a lot, but in a good way, I swear. I still have that card on my  desk, and I tear up every time I look at it.</p>
<p>I’m not the only one with stories. Here are some from other people  who have had the pleasure and privilege of working with Morgamic:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m not sure I consistently hear more praise for any other manager  at Mozilla as I do about Morgamic. That includes me hearing myself talk about  how pleased I’ve been over the past two years to have him mentor me —  and our entire team. I feel pushed to do great work because of him, but  in a way unique to him and Fred (who I have to think he mentored  well, given their similar management styles) — constantly encouraged and  pushed but with amazing empathy and reason for pushing me. He also encouraged us all to get along with each other and all of Mozilla,  taken what seems to me as the sanest growth plan in Mozilla, and  strived to build an awesome team instead of just a big one. He  encouraged us to reach out and include “former” colleagues and constantly  bring potentials into the webdev world.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Mike Morgan brought me to Mozilla, a move I had always wanted and was appreciative of. It wasn’t until I had to opportunity to really work with Mike and see him in action that I realized how much of a compliment it was to have him seek me. Mike invests so much into each of his developers that they can’t help but strive for greatness to repay the favor. Morgamic fought hard for his developers and made sure they were working on something they were passionate about. I’m proud to have worked with and for Mike Morgan and I’m already jealous of the next set of developers he’ll lead. Mozilla wont be the same without him. Legend.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Like many of us on the web development team, I came to Mozilla through  Mike. I’ve worked closely with him for 7 years and watched him grow  from a volunteer developer into a well respected leader. I watched a  team of two turn into a team of fifty with his expertise and guidance.  He is magnetic - someone who naturally acts as a hub, of people, of  information, and of value. He strived to be a better leader, reading  books, studying role models, and speaking with experts about how to  encourage excellence on his team. People who have worked with him will  understand how short “he’ll be missed” falls - we’re all fortunate to  have worked with him for this long, and really, I guess we’ve been  greedy, it’s only fair to let the rest of the world have a chance too. “</em></li>
<li><em>“Even when we disagreed he trusted me. He could have ordered me to do  something else, or ordered my boss to order me. Instead he’d take me for  coffee and try to convince me of another way. Usually he succeeded, but  when he didn’t he would go out of his way to support my decision. Our  products were a byproduct of his relentless focus on the team — hiring  the right people and trusting them to make the right decisions.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Morgamic embodied Mozilla in so many ways. He was a continual positive influence in everything we did in WebDev, always believing in people and trying to get them to improve themselves. But he went far beyond the boundaries of the team and influenced so many others. His legacy at Mozilla will continue on from those lucky enough to have worked with him.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Soon after I switched from the Webdev team to the Engagement team,  Morgamic walked by the glass walls of a meeting room I was doing a video  conference in. He walked away, came back with a whiteboard marker, drew  a heart, and left.</em><em><br />
I’d follow that man to Hades.” </em></li>
<li><em>“He helped me feel good at Mozilla very quickly. I like how he can be totally not serious sometimes, but efficient when he needs to. He gathered an impressive team of wonderful, excellent, incredible Web  devs (except me, of course, but every team has its weakness <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.laurathomson.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> ). </em><em>We were the first interns to win the Annual Employees VS Interns Basketball match!”</em></li>
<li><em>“Morgamic exemplified Mozilla for me. Openness, transparency, and just plain fight-for-the-user awesomeness. Morgamic was one of the few managers I’ve had who was less my superior and more my facilitator. He often acted like a Mozilla concierge - ensuring I had what I needed, intervening where I was blocked, and making sure I was happy and headed in the right direction. I don’t think I ever disagreed with his strategic decisions, which often had included my input or had at least been communicated to me early & often. Not that my agreement is needed to run the company, but it at least felt like he always had my back and we were doing things the right way.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’ve known and worked with Mike for ten years. On meeting him, I knew immediately that I had met one of those rare personalities that one encounters only only a few times in life. I watched Mike mature over the years in both his personal and professional life. One Mozilla cantina night, I recall sitting with Shaver and, possibly, Schrep: the conversation was about finding good engineering management. I remember pointing across the room to Mike, who likely at that moment was doing something very silly/dangerous will alcohol and fire. ‘There is your man, promote from within and you’ll see amazing things from him.’ I think I nailed it.”<br />
</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The words “he will be missed” are so far from adequate it’s not even funny.</p>
<p>His legacy at Mozilla will live on, in the projects he built, in the  people he mentored, through every Open Source project that comes out  of Webdev, in the Mozilla mission, and in the hearts of all of us. I  can’t wait to see what he pulls off next - I’ll be watching, and so  should you, because I have no doubt it will be amazing. Remember, too,  that being a Mozillian isn’t something that stops just because you  change jobs. It’s more like what happens when your best friend moves  away. Nothing changes except the logistics.</p>
<p>As for the rest of us, we will miss him, but we will go on working for the Open Web as the better people he helped us to be.</p>
<p>On  his last day working at Mozilla, Morgamic said, “Webdev isn’t a job,  it’s a movement.” I’ll leave you with that, and with this video, that I  know he liked to watch over and over:<br />

<h3>Diversity beyond gender</h3>
<p>My first session of the day was about creating welcoming spaces that encourage all kinds of diversity, rather than only focusing on gender. Those present were very interested in physical space issues involving hacker/maker spaces or running events. We discussed a set of practices that have worked in several spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the people involved set the agenda and define the uses of a space.</li>
<li>Create an environment where a person of color is not the only person of color when they walk in.</li>
<li>Describe a space as a “makerspace” rather than a “hackerspace”.</li>
<li>Make events invite-only to establish a welcoming culture.</li>
<li>Don’t say “please come if you are a woman”. This is tokenizing language that discourages participation. </li>
<li>Invite everyone to organize events, not just attend events.</li>
<li>Invite people to events through existing, established groups.</li>
<li>Spend time thinking about who and what is missing from a group or space and take action to fix or change. </li>
</ul>
<p>Patterns of exclusion start long before we deal with them in technology culture.</p>
<h3>Being feminine in tech</h3>
<p>This was a very large group, so we attempted to focus discussion on some key issues. I was also reminded of “<a href=\"http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Grunch\">grunch</a>“, the feeling you get when you’ve suddenly been reminded that you’ve got a feminine body.</p>
<p>Our initial set of discussion topics were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Masculinity valued over femininity — how do we get to express a masculine identity in an authentic way and not devalue femininity? Are we expressing masculinity because it’s who we are or because we perceive it as having more value?</li>
<li>How “woman” can I be? do I have to switch to their language? what rules do I have follow?</li>
<li>How do I make suggestions for a more gender neutral culture in the workplace?</li>
<li>Peer shaming if you represent as highly feminine or androgynous</li>
<li>Reacting to the hyper masculine by occupying a more feminine place despite its authenticity</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants shared a series of stories about their experiences expressing feminine or masculine dress, haircut, physical attributes. Most of the descriptions were posed as experiments — “I spent a month wearing dresses to normalize femininity in my workplace and here’s what happened.” The experiments women are running on themselves and their coworkers to try to get people used to women in the workplace are fascinating and shocking. Reflecting on the discussion, I felt like we were back in pre-women’s suffrage, where men were shocked at women working or wanting equal rights.</p>
<p>I also realized that I think about issues with what I wear a lot, but rarely talk about it with my colleagues.</p>
<p>I learned about differentiating between a few different concepts when talking about expressing femininity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gender policing: comments designed to inform someone that they’re violating an accepted norm. Examples include being described as “dressing too slutty”, aggressive attention when a woman has a shaved head and looks masculine or androgynous. </li>
<li>Masculine assimilation: dressing more masculine to avoid unwanted attention</li>
<li>Feminine presentation seen as inviting sexual attention: several people described a dramatic change in behavior among colleagues or students when women wore traditionally feminine clothing (skirts, dresses, blouses)</li>
<li>Peer shaming: in this context, we discussed concerns with women who shame other women over appearing/acting too feminine, or using feminine symbols like the color pink.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was a lot more to this conversation. Looking back over the notes, I am a bit overwhelmed at how much ground we covered among so many people in just an hour. This session also led to some other hallway track conversations where I learned a bit more about how individuals are trying to balance their activism with their personal relationships with other women in open source/hardware/culture communities.</p>
<h3>Hardware hacking!</h3>
<p>I spent some time with the hardware hackers. Several women brought soft circuits, and one person brought a soldering station so that people could try out soldering for the first time. I was trying to get some IR LEDs integrated into a headband, and we had some issues with the shape and the stretchiness of our material. Other folks at the table were making blinking fuzzy muppet/monsters for their badges. Lots of very adorable blinky things were assembled.</p>
<p>I did demonstrate how to troubleshoot LEDs and what IR light looks like on digital cameras. I talked a bit more about medical devices with someone looking into how to hack her own augmentations. It felt a little like a “from the future” conversation. <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<h3>Mozilla contributor dinner</h3>
<p>I spent Sunday evening having dinner with some Mozilla contributors from France and a couple coworkers. I was probably the only person at the table who spoke only English, reminding me that I really aught to keep up on my language lessons. <img alt=\":D\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" /> </p>
<p>I caught my buddy Diane up on what had happened at AdaCamp, met Delphine’s husband and tried to convince some contributors to lead an effort to have an AdaCamp in Europe!</p>
<p>By the end of the evening, I was ready to collapse and get back to Portland!</p>
<h3>Summing up</h3>
<p>My last post about AdaCamp will be reflecting on all three of the camps – starting in Melbourne, Australia, then Washington, DC and finally in San Francisco. The event has grown from about 40 people to 200+, and for me, is the most exciting gathering of women in open source, open hardware and open culture. I’ve never been around so many women who share the same values, who are fighting for openness in technology and who are focused on tearing down the many barriers we face to involving more women in our technical communities.</p>" nil nil "fdf27d8b23083562e40ec219e8df1f21") (209 (20949 15560 730419) "http://www.glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?post/2013/06/24/BlueGriffon-and-%40media-print-stylesheets" "Daniel Glazman: BlueGriffon and '@media print' stylesheets" "glazou" "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 14:18:00 +0000" "<p>I'm still playing a lot with  (hear \"coding on\"...)

ads because of third party cookies, and in general about the lack
of privacy on the internets</p>
<p>I made the decision to not depend on a couple of big companies
anymore for all my data in the cloud and to pay for the services
I really needed & use the proper Firefox addons to cut down
on the ads.</p>
<p>I slowly moved away from Google.</p>
<p>I moved to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.newsblur.com/\">NewsBlur</a>
instead of Google Reader - before Reader was planned to be stopped.</p>
<p>I moved from Gmail to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://fastmail.fm\">fastmail.fm</a>. That was the
hardest one because I was on Gmail since 2004. Fastmail, it turns
out, has its servers in the U.S. too, but I guess having a
separate service for my e-mails is breaking the all-things-at-google
scheme. I am also trying to have my network use PGP when we exchange
e-mails, so they're stored encrypted on those servers I don't own.</p>
<p>Last, I moved from the Google search engine to DuckDuckGo, then
to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://startpage.com/\">StartPage</a>. The latter gives better
results than DuckDuckGo in general because it's a proxy on the
top of Google search engine. It just secures your privacy and
unlike DDG, you won't get <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/privacy\">Amazon referral links in your results</a>  I'd rather pay a yearly
rate at DDG rather than this referral system.</p>
<p>Anyways, I kept my Google account for two reasons: redirecting mails
to my fastmail account and using Google+ because I like this service
a lot. The redirection is not important anymore. After over a year of
redirection - people should know how to reach me :)</p>
<p>I also had Facebook to stay connected with my non-geek friends
mostly. I also use Twitter a lot.</p>
<p>However, the recent privacy scandals made me think a bit about
how I use all these services.</p>
<p>First of all, G+ and Facebook provide features to share <strong>privately</strong>
some data to a specific set of people. We've seen that our privacy
is not guaranteed. They'll give your data away if they're asked.</p>
<p>And well, they are commercial companies that need to sell ads,
so your private content is used anyways. Just look at the ads that
are displayed besides your e-mail when you use GMail.</p>
<p>So while there's an incentive to let you share data thinking
it's not public, shit happens. So I don't see the point of pushing
anything non-public in those silos. And it turns out that I am mostly
a consumer. Too bad G+ is a private club and you can't see its
content if you don't have a Google account.</p>
<p>If I have cool stuff to talk about, I can blog and probably
do a better job in one blog post than in numerous G+ or FB posts.</p>
<p>Twitter on the other hand, is mostly shouting out in public your
opinions, promoting your projects. I barely use the DM feature.</p>
<p>Twitter is not different of course from Google & Facebook - they
need to sell ads and your data is used for this, but at least it's
easier to control that you're only pushing public stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Given all of this, I have deleted my Google and Facebook accounts yesterday</strong></p>
<p>(well, for FB unfortunately I reactivated it today because I lost
access to my Spotify Premium account - so until this is solved, my FB
is still active but it's a matter of days.)</p>
<p>All of this if of course is the tip of the iceberg since we eventually
found out that governments can just extract content from the flow that
goes through undersea cables.</p>
<p>But what I am doing is still important. It's a political act that will
shape the future if we're a bunch of people acting like this.
We need to show through our online habits and actions that we care about
our privacy.</p>
<p>On the phone side, I guess I am in a pretty good shape since I use Firefox OS.

I would switch to a Community Flavor and see how it worked and see if I could keep it as my desktop instead of Ubuntu.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The requirements I had for desktop challenge:</p>
<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">
<li>Must be Ubuntu Community Flavor</li>
<li>Firefox shipped as default browser</li>
<li>Preference to lighter weight DE</li>
<li>Solid Support and Dev Sub-Community</li>
<li>Must respect <a href=\"http://blog.sidstamm.com/2012/12/what-is-privacy.html\" target=\"_blank\">privacy</a></li>
</ul>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The conclusion for me based on those requirements was that Xubuntu was the best candidate for my 30-day challenge although I did consider Kubuntu. But their lack of shipping Firefox as a default was a deal breaker for me even though they still have an equally crisp desktop.</p>

a week, to start a new job at Mozilla.</p>
<p>That was a huge change in my life since I had to interact daily with people
in English, cope with the 9 hours timezone and try to keep up the pace of
working with smarter people than me (I am still the dumbest.)</p>
<p>I was the only guy in Europe in the Services team, and had to wait until
7pm to actually chat with my colleagues and exchange info. I had numerous
late nights of work the first year.</p>
<p>But it was worthing the pain: I was the first Python guy in the Services
team and worked to convert the Firefox Sync server to a \"state of the art\"
Python application, along with all the ecosystem around it.</p>
<p>A big challenge I was quite proud of taking. I was trusted to do the
right things and helped the team moving off the PHP version.</p>
<p>The Python launch did not go well because of a bug we could not really
have avoided, and I had a few sleepless nights and nightmares before
everything went back to normal. Eventually, the Python version worked
very well and the next apps were built using the same tools & recipes.</p>
<p>The team grew and more Python folks joined later on. I've learned a lot
during that time and looking back, those stressful weeks were the
best times I had.</p>
<p>Since that first year, a lot of things have changed at Mozilla:
Alexis joined the team and I slowly went back to a normal schedule
since we've managed to start a 'Europe team' and work together.</p>
<p>The new Paris office opened a few months ago and you can feel
that the Europe side of Mozilla is growing big time.</p>
<p>I don't feel like a remote guy away from his office anymore
so that's great :)</p>
<p>These days I am doing a lot of work in building tools for
server-side developers. I should include qa and devops as well.</p>
<p>Namely: Circus, Vaurien, Loads & Cornice.</p>
<p>I love what I am doing and I think those tools are useful
outside our team itself.</p>
<p>Circus & Cornice are starting to get patches from outside
Mozilla so that's great.</p>
<p>Last but not least: Everytime a privacy or a patent scandal
occurs, I am proud that my thoughts & opinions are exactly
the ones that are defended and echoed by Mozilla voices.

One variant that has applications far beyond initial import is contact sharing via Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
It would be great if I could send contacts back and forth between all my devices, including the Firefox OS ones. Other phones usually can send and receive contacts in VCard (.vcf) format via Bluetooth, but Firefox OS so far is missing this functionality (even though some VCard support exists for import from SD card in 1.1, though I could never get that to work for me).<br />
<br />
A reasonably usable implementation for sharing could be implemented as an app: It would need to read from the Contacts API, present a selection to the user, assemble VCard files and send those off via a Web Activity so the existing Bluetooth sharing can act on them. With that, the sending side should work.<br />
The receiving side would be a bit more hacky, but also doable: Unfortunately, the existing Bluetooth support does not call a Web Activity for handling not explicitely supported file types, it only ends up saving them on the SD card. So the contact sharing app would need to periodically look for new VCard files in that location, read and offer to import them, and finally use the Contacts API again to write them into the system's database.<br />
<br />
If someone would pick up the needed work there, I'm sure the app would be quite popular, and I'd love to use it myself. Ultimately, I think this functionality should be part of the official Contacts apps, so having any such app available under a licence that allows Gaia to use the code would be great. Still, I think it would be awesome to have the app so the soon-shipping Firefox-OS-1.0.1-powered devices can use them.<br />

I live it, I breathe it, I was there when it became available to a larger audience at an affordable rate and I have seen it grow more and more to the most interesting, versatile and easiest to participate media out there. I’ve witnessed the power it gives to people who have no voice in traditional media and give people education where their social standing or school system would not support them.</p>
<p>This is why it hurts me to see people squander the opportunity that is the web away by clogging it with short-lived, let’s say it – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE0CRMm59BY\">bullshit</a>. Sure, this is a natural thing – the web is a normal part of our lives and the new generation of users is web-native, meaning they don’t know any longer what it would be like to be offline. When we stop seeing something as hard to get it becomes a commodity and we value it less. Didn’t have to fight for it, so why see it as something I should care for? It is always there, isn’t it? Much like we waste drinking water until we lived in a country where you couldn’t drink from the tap.</p>
<p><img alt=\"didn't read, LOL - apparently something to be proud of…\" src=\"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/198/460/iwkoqt.gif\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>The time when we listened to random beeping sounds from our modems and got excited when we got a full 56KB connection for a change are over. Mobile connectivity is still a problem, and sometimes gets expensive but even then the connection speeds are great. That is when you are in the country where your mobile contract and in “first world” countries. Get out of this world and you still feel the flakiness of connectivity and you get much more grateful for information becoming available after the third exasperated reload of the current web page.</p>
<p>And this is where I get very disappointed when I see that we are moving into a world where people stop using text and words to describe their feelings, ideas and plans and – well, <em>communicate</em> with others. Instead we are confronted with an avalanche of images, memes, animated GIFs of several megabytes and age-old fake conversations, jokes and “inspirational quotes” as badly optimised JPGs full of artifacts. We also get a lot of messages that could be a short post in the form of a video with terrible lighting and bad audio. They are easy to make, but they are much harder to consume. I can skim a long text until it gets interesting. I can not do that with a video unless I have a timed transcript.</p>
<p>I am not even going to start on the accessibility issues that come from a web that consists solely of images and videos. I am talking about incredibly useful technology and systems that are available to us as a result of a just a bit more than a decade of web evolution becoming useless.</p>
<p>Search engines like text. You will get your productions on the web found by having good text in there. Your images and videos can be as amazing as they come – if there is no descriptive text all you get is traffic coming from people seeing your things and sharing them. This can be incredibly powerful – something “going viral” can get you a lot of hits and shares in a very short amount of time and give you the false impression that you are a success and made an impact on the web. But the success is fleeting and a few minutes later the next cool thing will come around. A day later other people will share your work as theirs and again get a quick fix of fame. It is turning the web into a pure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber\">Operant Conditioning Chamber</a>, the same phenomenon that powers casual online gaming and makes people give up on privacy, as explained eloquently by <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxObserver-Cory-Doctorow\">Cory Doctorow in his TEDxObserver talk</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, social sharing also has great benefits beyond the quick fame. People describing your work in their words when sharing can add different language explanations or give your content more impact as an important voice people trust tweeted about it, but it relies on the good-will of people consuming what you produce and making the effort to share it or write words around it. If you provided the words from the beginning, you’ll get this as extra on top of people who will find your work using search engines – because you used text. And even better, if someone gets to your product and doesn’t speak your language, they can use a free translation service to get the product in at least an approximation of their language. We can use web technology to make products more accessible to us without having to rely on a social interaction of someone capable of both languages to do the work for us.</p>
<p>Above all, what bugs me is that the flood of memes, animated GIFs and videos and their quick, false fame robs new users of the web of the opportunity to learn how to speed-read, write and – above all – communicate in writing. I learned English in a few ways. First of all, in school, which works well if your teacher is not a non-native English speaker just trying to get through the curriculum. Secondly, I watched English TV series (Monty Python, as this was the only non-dubbed show) with subtitles. This taught me to understand English and thus – subconsciously – how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>A large part of me learning other languages though was through text communication with people from other countries. First on notes sent on floppy disks in the mail trading demos and tools, then on BBSes and then on the web. Reading and writing comments, hanging out on <span class=\"caps\">IRC</span> and having many a fight and a lot of brainstorming there, taking part in forums and mailing lists, newsgroups and finally in social networks like Facebook and Google+. I could talk to someone on the other side of the globe, in real time, and it didn’t take ages to get a video or suffered from bad audio on a phone call or voice call.</p>
<p>It baffles me to see that we have a world-wide communication network with a very low barrier to entry and nearly no expense on publishing and we don’t use it to better ourselves, to make us better communicators. Instead we complain that governments don’t do enough to make school education better. Today you don’t need to buy a book in another language and wait for it in the mail. You can get it online and read it in Kindle, Google Play books, or even go to <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/‎\">Project Gutenberg</a> and read them for free. And yet people using proper grammar on the web are congratulated for it or – more commonly – made fun of. A higher level of education should not be a surprise in a world that has access to the largest library ever. It should be a given.</p>
<p>Words are powerful, they spark a theatre in the head. People reading your words make their own pictures at a speed pictures could never be transmitted. Instead of giving one image you create a gallery, one that you will never see, but your readers do. And this gallery is very personal to them and thus gets remembered much more. Of course words can cause controversy, misunderstandings and can hurt. But even then they can spark a conversation and make you realise the effect of your actions much more than a “like” or an “upvote” could ever do.</p>
<p>The old saying that a picture says a thousand words is true when it comes to explanations. Re-hashing memes and jumping on bandwagons based on current pop culture references that will be impossible to grasp a month later doesn’t say a thousand words. It basically says “I am lazy, here is a quick laugh to hint at my creativity”. We are blessed to be able to transmit our thoughts to an audience we will never be able to meet physically. We should not squander this.</p>
<p>Please, use your words. Turn on that grammar check, re-read that tweet before you send it. Write a short sentence instead of posting a meme we’ve seen thousands of times before. And don’t get discouraged when people don’t jump on it and thank you or go nuts about it. This is not for fame, this is for you. If all technology fails, words and gestures is what we have. You can exercise and train your brain to paint with words, to create gorgeous constructs. You get better the more you push yourself to not be lazy and use the obvious word but one that is more specific. Words are beautiful. Paint with them, compose with them, woo people with them.</p>" nil nil "35dfb92f0761e4b5cfc173bb1addf1fb") (203 (20949 15560 396021) "http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2013/06/22/weeknote-252013/" "Doug Belshaw: Weeknote 25/2013" "Doug Belshaw" "Sat, 22 Jun 2013 13:46:00 +0000" "<p>This week I’ve been:</p>

<p>I'm running Debian Testing and had done some Gaia/FirefoxOS work in
late 2012. I had my development environment still set up including adb
and fastboot.</p>
<p>I wanted to switch the phone to the nightly channel which is what I
was using (or thought I was using) with my Unagi. Mostly I followed

card I had in my Unagi phone. The Micro SD card has all my media on
it---not my suer data. I thought about moving my user data over, but
I've had the Unagi so long that I figured my user data is probably in
a funky state anyhow and better to start over.</p>
<p>Couple of thoughts:</p>
<ol class=\"arabic simple\">
<li>The nightly build is version 2.0.0-prerelease.</li>
<li>The phone is a lot bigger than the Unagi---it'll take a bit of
getting used to.</li>
<li>Most things worked fine. I even got a marketing message from
T-Mobile minutes after I inserted my SIM card and got on the
network.</li>

<p>There are a few issues (the camera is not working at all). I need to
spend some time with Bugzilla to file those with useful
data. Regardless, the phone is working pretty well and I'm probably
going to switch to it as my primary phone soon. That might give me

<p></p>
<p>I’ve said this many times before, but let me now here repeat the things that really get me excited like a 5 year old on sugar rush about Firefox OS:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Firefox OS kills the idea of mobile web connectivity only being for the rich in the western world.</strong> Yes, for us in the US or the UK having a new shiny phone every half year is not an issue as companies are killing each other trying to underbid the price and offers of the others. But a usable Android that is not generations behind and hard-wired to a terrible stock browser or an iPhone is just not affordable to everyone. Even worse, if you have no credit card you couldn’t even buy apps for them. This is unfair, elitist and plainly against anything the web stands for. FirefoxOS is affordable, and apps can be bought on prepay or on your phone bill and the OS is the browser which means updates are easy</li><li><strong>FirefoxOS does not assume a fast, stable and always available connection</strong>. When traveling I start hating my Android phone which I love to bits otherwise. Having dozens of megabyte updates over roaming is out of the question and neither is using flaky and slow wireless connections. Firefox OS has no native apps – all of them, including the system apps are written in <span class=\"caps\">HTML</span>, CSS and JavaScript.

I live it, I breathe it, I was there when it became available to a larger audience at an affordable rate and I have seen it grow more and more to the most interesting, versatile and easiest to participate media out there. I’ve witnessed the power it gives to people who have no voice in traditional media and give people education where their social standing or school system would not support them.</p>
<p>This is why it hurts me to see people squander the opportunity that is the web away by clogging it with short-lived, let’s say it – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE0CRMm59BY\">bullshit</a>. Sure, this is a natural thing – the web is a normal part of our lives and the new generation of users is web-native, meaning they don’t know any longer what it would be like to be offline. When we stop seeing something as hard to get it becomes a commodity and we value it less. Didn’t have to fight for it, so why see it as something I should care for? It is always there, isn’t it? Much like we waste drinking water until we lived in a country where you couldn’t drink from the tap.</p>
<p><img alt=\"didn't read, LOL - apparently something to be proud of…\" src=\"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/198/460/iwkoqt.gif\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>The time when we listened to random beeping sounds from our modems and got excited when we got a full 56KB connection for a change are over. Mobile connectivity is still a problem, and sometimes gets expensive but even then the connection speeds are great. That is when you are in the country where your mobile contract and in “first world” countries. Get out of this world and you still feel the flakiness of connectivity and you get much more grateful for information becoming available after the third exasperated reload of the current web page.</p>
<p>And this is where I get very disappointed when I see that we are moving into a world where people stop using text and words to describe their feelings, ideas and plans and – well, <em>communicate</em> with others. Instead we are confronted with an avalanche of images, memes, animated GIFs of several megabytes and age-old fake conversations, jokes and “inspirational quotes” as badly optimised JPGs full of artifacts. We also get a lot of messages that could be a short post in the form of a video with terrible lighting and bad audio. They are easy to make, but they are much harder to consume. I can skim a long text until it gets interesting. I can not do that with a video unless I have a timed transcript.</p>
<p>I am not even going to start on the accessibility issues that come from a web that consists solely of images and videos. I am talking about incredibly useful technology and systems that are available to us as a result of a just a bit more than a decade of web evolution becoming useless.</p>
<p>Search engines like text. You will get your productions on the web found by having good text in there. Your images and videos can be as amazing as they come – if there is no descriptive text all you get is traffic coming from people seeing your things and sharing them. This can be incredibly powerful – something “going viral” can get you a lot of hits and shares in a very short amount of time and give you the false impression that you are a success and made an impact on the web. But the success is fleeting and a few minutes later the next cool thing will come around. A day later other people will share your work as theirs and again get a quick fix of fame. It is turning the web into a pure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber\">Operant Conditioning Chamber</a>, the same phenomenon that powers casual online gaming and makes people give up on privacy, as explained eloquently by <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxObserver-Cory-Doctorow\">Cory Doctorow in his TEDxObserver talk</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, social sharing also has great benefits beyond the quick fame. People describing your work in their words when sharing can add different language explanations or give your content more impact as an important voice people trust tweeted about it, but it relies on the good-will of people consuming what you produce and making the effort to share it or write words around it. If you provided the words from the beginning, you’ll get this as extra on top of people who will find your work using search engines – because you used text. And even better, if someone gets to your product and doesn’t speak your language, they can use a free translation service to get the product in at least an approximation of their language. We can use web technology to make products more accessible to us without having to rely on a social interaction of someone capable of both languages to do the work for us.</p>
<p>Above all, what bugs me is that the flood of memes, animated GIFs and videos and their quick, false fame robs new users of the web of the opportunity to learn how to speed-read, write and – above all – communicate in writing. I learned English in a few ways. First of all, in school, which works well if your teacher is not a non-native English speaker just trying to get through the curriculum. Secondly, I watched English TV series (Monty Python, as this was the only non-dubbed show) with subtitles. This taught me to understand English and thus – subconsciously – how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>A large part of me learning other languages though was through text communication with people from other countries. First on notes sent on floppy disks in the mail trading demos and tools, then on BBSes and then on the web. Reading and writing comments, hanging out on <span class=\"caps\">IRC</span> and having many a fight and a lot of brainstorming there, taking part in forums and mailing lists, newsgroups and finally in social networks like Facebook and Google+. I could talk to someone on the other side of the globe, in real time, and it didn’t take ages to get a video or suffered from bad audio on a phone call or voice call.</p>
<p>It baffles me to see that we have a world-wide communication network with a very low barrier to entry and nearly no expense on publishing and we don’t use it to better ourselves, to make us better communicators. Instead we complain that governments don’t do enough to make school education better. Today you don’t need to buy a book in another language and wait for it in the mail. You can get it online and read it in Kindle, Google Play books, or even go to <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/‎\">Project Gutenberg</a> and read them for free. And yet people using proper grammar on the web are congratulated for it or – more commonly – made fun of. A higher level of education should not be a surprise in a world that has access to the largest library ever. It should be a given.</p>
<p>Words are powerful, they spark a theatre in the head. People reading your words make their own pictures at a speed pictures could never be transmitted. Instead of giving one image you create a gallery, one that you will never see, but your readers do. And this gallery is very personal to them and thus gets remembered much more. Of course words can cause controversy, misunderstandings and can hurt. But even then they can spark a conversation and make you realise the effect of your actions much more than a “like” or an “upvote” could ever do.</p>
<p>The old saying that a picture says a thousand words is true when it comes to explanations. Re-hashing memes and jumping on bandwagons based on current pop culture references that will be impossible to grasp a month later doesn’t say a thousand words. It basically says “I am lazy, here is a quick laugh to hint at my creativity”. We are blessed to be able to transmit our thoughts to an audience we will never be able to meet physically. We should not squander this.</p>
<p>Please, use your words. Turn on that grammar check, re-read that tweet before you send it. Write a short sentence instead of posting a meme we’ve seen thousands of times before. And don’t get discouraged when people don’t jump on it and thank you or go nuts about it. This is not for fame, this is for you. If all technology fails, words and gestures is what we have. You can exercise and train your brain to paint with words, to create gorgeous constructs. You get better the more you push yourself to not be lazy and use the obvious word but one that is more specific. Words are beautiful. Paint with them, compose with them, woo people with them.</p>" nil nil "dae0b097561ef41ce3dc5491f0e0de96") (196 (20948 23049 409396) "http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2013/07/02/a-practical-guide-to-using-alembic/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-practical-guide-to-using-alembic" "Selena Deckelmann: A practical guide to using Alembic" "selena" "Tue, 02 Jul 2013 23:58:07 +0000" "<p><em>I spent some time guiding a coworker through using <a href=\"http://alembic.readthedocs.org\">Alembic</a> for the first time with <a href=\"http://github.com/mozilla/socorro\">Socorro</a> this morning and what follows are my notes from that meeting.</em></p>
<p>I’ve been using Alembic, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration\">database schema migration</a> tool, for about three months now, and really liking it a lot. I created a blog post that served as a slide deck for an internal team called <a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2013/05/17/migrations-with-alembic-a-lightspeed-tour/\">A lightspeed tour of Alembic</a> as my first stab at user education.</p>
<p>Setting things up initially was pretty simple, but explaining it to a coworker after I’d set everything up for myself proved slightly more difficult. Below are my notes on the differences between <a href=\"http://alembic.readthedocs.org\">Alembic</a> and some other migration tool.</p>
<h4>Terminology</h4>
<p>Alembic calls each migration a <em>revision</em>. Revisions know what order to be run in because each revision is given a <code>down_revision</code> to identify its parent. If <code>down_revision</code> is <code>None</code>, that revision is the very first revision according to Alembic. You can put your whole schema in that revision, or you can just start adding changes to this initial revision. Alembic doesn’t complain either way.</p>
<p>A best practice would likely be putting your entire model into the first revision. I may go back and “fix” this for us later. I opted to just have the default use case be to create a database fresh with a tool we call <code>setupdb_app.py</code>.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to migrate to using alembic, you’ll also need to use SQLAlchemy. I used sqlautocode for my initial schema <a href=\"http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/schema.html#reflecting-database-objects\">reflection</a>, and there’s a new tool <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/agronholm/sqlacodegen/src\">sqlacodegen</a> you may want to check out for generating your SQLAlchemy models for the first time.</p>
<h4>Preparation: edit config and activate a virtualenv</h4>
<p>Our environment was set up per the <a href=\"https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#creating-an-environment\">alembic tutorial for creating an environment</a>. I ran:</p>
<p><code>alembic init alembic</code></p>
<p>I also put an <code>alembic.ini-dist</code> file into our project’s <code>config/</code> directory, and modified <code>alembic/env.py</code> to include our model.</p>
<p>To get started working with an existing install, you’ll need to modify <code>alembic.ini-dist</code>, and copy it to <code>config/alembic.ini</code> to fit your environment – setting the connection string and the path to the alembic directory are the two most important settings. We have a script which creates databases from our <code>models.py</code> called <code>setupdb_app.py</code>. This script takes <code>--database_name</code> as a command-line argument. My default for our project is to use <code>breakpad</code>.</p>
<p>We use a <code>virtualenv</code> called <code>socorro-virtualenv</code>. The virtualenv is created automatically if you run <code>make test</code>. If you’re creating a standalone virtualenv, you can do that with <code>virtualenv socorro-virtualenv</code>. Activate this with <code>. socorro-virtualenv/bin/activate</code>.</p>
<h3>Creating a revision</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a fresh database to work from. For Socorro, the command is: <code>PYTHONPATH=. socorro/external/postgresql/setupdb_app.py --database_name=breakpad</code></li>
<li>Edit <code>models.py</code> with the change to the schema</li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini revision -m 'your message about the migration'</code>. The output will include the name of the new file.</li>
<li>Edit that file as needed <code>alembic/versions/*.py</code></li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini upgrade +1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>If all goes well, your revision is ready! If something goes wrong, edit and try again. The revision will automatically rollback if there are any errors.</p>
<h3>Production deployment</h3>
<p>You’ll need to deploy an <code>alembic.ini</code> on your production database system and probably a <code>virtualenv</code> to support your python modules.</p>
<p>We deploy our virtualenvs with our application, so this step was pretty simple for everything except for alembic itself. The virtualenv put in full, static paths for the python binaries and had some dependencies that I haven’t figured out yet for actually running alembic. To get around this, I created a virualenv locally on the system for the <em>postgres</em> user. Having your postgres user run the migrations locally is a must for me because I need to access the filesystem to pull in new versions of user defined functions stashed in the directory my model lives in.</p>
<p>I just deploy a new release of our application code on the database server locally, and then I run alembic against the <code>versions</code> directory that’s deployed.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>And here’s an FAQ for the common problems folks ran into:</p>
<h4>OOPS I forgot to create a database before I created a revision!</h4>
<p>To “fix” this, try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the database from scratch using your current <code>models.py</code>.</li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini downgrade -1</code></li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini upgrade +1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming your downgrade function works, this should allow you reverse the latest revision and then test your migration.</p>
<h4>Error message: “Only a single head supported so far.”</h4>
<p>See <a href=\"https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#working-with-branches\">Working with Branches</a>.</p>
<h4>I’m using schemas, and alembic doesn’t recognize them when I try to use <code>--autogenerate</code>.</h4>
<p>See <a href=\"http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html?highlight=include_symbol\">include_symbol</a>. And be sure to add this to both the “offline” and “online” versions of the revision code in <code>env.py</code>.</p>
<h4>Error message: Target database is not up to date.</h4>
<p>This means you’ve got a file in your <code>versions</code> directory that contains one or more migrations that haven’t been applied to the current database. You can either apply them with <code>alembic upgrade head</code> or have a look in that directory and remove the migration(s) that you don’t want.</p>" nil nil "620b9c095cdbb586630001d8b9271a72") (195 (20948 18141 789648) "http://irinasandu.com/2013/07/03/firefox-os-the-job-to-be-done/" "Irina Sandu: Firefox OS =?utf-8?Q?=E2=80=93?= the job to be done" "Irina Sandu" "Wed, 03 Jul 2013 15:09:08 +0000" "<p><a href=\"http://irinas.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/screen-shot-2013-07-02-at-11-34-39-pm.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-07-02 at 11.34.39 PM\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-659\" height=\"266\" src=\"http://irinas.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/screen-shot-2013-07-02-at-11-34-39-pm.png?w=487&h=266\" width=\"487\" /></a></p>

<h4><strong>Firefox OS doesn’t reach the user by itself</strong></h4>
<p>One important difference that we’ve had to adapt to to develop Firefox OS is that before it reaches the user, an operating system needs to integrate with other parts, created by other organizations. Unlike the browser, the operating system is not something that we give to users by itself. It is only one layer that goes into a mobile phone and it is important that it connects and collaborates with the other parts that make up a phone experience.</p>
<p>That meant that when we thought about the features and functions that we would like to build in a device there were a lot that we had not a lot of influence over, because we were not creating them. Before we could start thinking about where Firefox OS could excel at, we needed to separate its function within a phone and the mobile ecosystem from that of the other players. In other words, we needed to know what is <strong>the job to be done of Firefox OS</strong>.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>There are 5 layers in the mobile ecosystem</strong></h4>
<p>To do this we started breaking down the elements of the mobile ecosystem and define what are the different parts that interact with each other, what is their function and what type of organizations are producing them.</p>
<p>To do this, we looked at what are the steps that content needs to go through from when it’s created by the developer to when it is consumed by the user. A day in the life of content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information is created and stored on servers by <strong>developers</strong> in form of <strong>content</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bytes need to be <strong>transported</strong> to their destination, a job assigned to the <strong>network equipment providers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As a copy of the information leaves the server, it needs to know to which destination to go. It is important that the content is returned to the person who actually asked for it, not to a random one or to the whole network. This job is done by the <strong>network operator</strong>, by means of the IP address, whose key role is that of <strong>authentication</strong> for the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Once it has reached the user, the information still needs to be <strong>processed</strong> on to a screen by a device, which is made by <strong>hardware manufacturers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After it is stored on the hardware, the information is organized and <strong>consumed</strong> by the user through the means of the a <strong>user agent</strong>, which is the operating system. This is where Firefox OS comes in.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h4><strong>Firefox OS is the interface and the data manager for the user</strong></h4>
<p>A user agent is the protective layer between the user and the rest of the ecosystem. It needs to represent the intentions and actions of the end – consumer to the rest of the layers that make up a phone, it needs to translate what is happening at the byte level to the user and in the same time protect against unauthorized access to other data stored on the device.</p>
<p>The <strong>job to be done</strong> of Firefox OS is not one, but several:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is the interface for the user to the entire mobile ecosystem</li>
<li>it represents the user when she wants to interact with the other layers of the phone</li>
<li>it organizes the user’s data</li>
<li>it surfaces the signals sent by the other parts of the phone</li>
<li>it protects the user’s data from unauthorized access</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating a revision</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a fresh database to work from. For Socorro, the command is: <code>PYTHONPATH=. socorro/external/postgresql/setupdb_app.py --database_name=breakpad</code></li>
<li>Edit <code>models.py</code> with the change to the schema</li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini revision -m 'your message about the migration'</code>. The output will include the name of the new file.</li>
<li>Edit that file as needed <code>alembic/versions/*.py</code></li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini upgrade +1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>If all goes well, your revision is ready! If something goes wrong, edit and try again. The revision will automatically rollback if there are any errors.</p>
<h3>Production deployment</h3>
<p>You’ll need to deploy an <code>alembic.ini</code> on your production database system and probably a <code>virtualenv</code> to support your python modules.</p>
<p>We deploy our virtualenvs with our application, so this step was pretty simple for everything except for alembic itself. The virtualenv put in full, static paths for the python binaries and had some dependencies that I haven’t figured out yet for actually running alembic. To get around this, I created a virualenv locally on the system for the <em>postgres</em> user. Having your postgres user run the migrations locally is a must for me because I need to access the filesystem to pull in new versions of user defined functions stashed in the directory my model lives in.</p>
<p>I just deploy a new release of our application code on the database server locally, and then I run alembic against the <code>versions</code> directory that’s deployed.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>And here’s an FAQ for the common problems folks ran into:</p>
<h4>OOPS I forgot to create a database before I created a revision!</h4>
<p>To “fix” this, try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the database from scratch using your current <code>models.py</code>.</li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini downgrade -1</code></li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini upgrade +1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming your downgrade function works, this should allow you reverse the latest revision and then test your migration.</p>
<h4>Error message: “Only a single head supported so far.”</h4>
<p>See <a href=\"https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#working-with-branches\">Working with Branches</a>.</p>
<h4>I’m using schemas, and alembic doesn’t recognize them when I try to use <code>--autogenerate</code>.</h4>
<p>See <a href=\"http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html?highlight=include_symbol\">include_symbol</a>. And be sure to add this to both the “offline” and “online” versions of the revision code in <code>env.py</code>.</p>
<h4>Error message: Target database is not up to date.</h4>
<p>This means you’ve got a file in your <code>versions</code> directory that contains one or more migrations that haven’t been applied to the current database. You can either apply them with <code>alembic upgrade head</code> or have a look in that directory and remove the migration(s) that you don’t want.</p>" nil nil "0d1d16fe2e1f49cce0e3f8d6a2c2769a") (193 (20947 56080 929660) "http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2013/07/02/a-practical-guide-to-using-alembic/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-practical-guide-to-using-alembic" "Selena Deckelmann: A practical guide to using Alembic" "selena" "Tue, 02 Jul 2013 23:58:07 +0000" "<p>I spent some time guiding a coworker through using <a href=\"http://alembic.readthedocs.org\">Alembic</a> for the first time with <a href=\"http://github.com/mozilla/socorro\">Socorro</a>. I’ve been using Alembic for about three months now, and really liking it a lot. I created a blog post that served as a slide deck for an internal team called <a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2013/05/17/migrations-with-alembic-a-lightspeed-tour/\">A lightspeed tour of Alembic</a> as my first stab at user education.</p>
<p>Setting things up initially was pretty simple, but explaining it to a coworker after I’d set everything up for myself proved slightly more difficult.</p>
<h4>Terminology</h4>
<p>Alembic calls each migration a <em>revision</em>. Revisions know what order to be run in because each revision is given a <code>down_revision</code> to identify its parent. If <code>down_revision</code> is <code>None</code>, that revision is the very first revision according to Alembic. You can put your whole schema in that revision, or you can just start adding changes to this initial revision. Alembic doesn’t complain either way.</p>
<h4>Preparation: edit config and activate a virtualenv</h4>
<p>Our environment was set up per the <a href=\"https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#creating-an-environment\">alembic tutorial for creating an environment</a>. I ran: <code>alembic init alembic</code>, and put an <code>alembic.ini-dist</code> file into our project’s <code>config/</code> directory. I also modified <code>alembic/env.py</code> to include our model.</p>
<p>You’ll need to modify <code>alembic.ini-dist</code>, and copy it to <code>config/alembic.ini</code> to fit your environment – setting the connection string and the path to the alembic directory are the two most important settings. We have a script which creates databases from our <code>models.py</code> called <code>setupdb_app.py</code>. This script takes <code>--database_name</code> as a command-line argument. My default for our project is to use <code>breakpad</code>.</p>
<p>We use a <code>virtualenv</code> called <code>socorro-virtualenv</code>. The virtualenv is created automatically if you run <code>make test</code>. If you’re creating a standalone virtualenv, you can do that with <code>virtualenv socorro-virtualenv</code>. Activate this with <code>. socorro-virtualenv/bin/activate</code>.</p>
<h3>Creating a revision</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a fresh database to work from. For Socorro, the command is: <code>PYTHONPATH=. socorro/external/postgresql/setupdb_app.py --database_name=breakpad</code></li>
<li>Edit <code>models.py</code> with the change to the schema</li>

<li>Edit that file as needed <code>alembic/versions/*.py</code></li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini upgrade +1</code></li>

For example, several language software packages are named after it, such as the <a href=\"http://www.babylon.com\">Babylon</a> electronic dictionary, <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Babel\">MediaWiki’s Babel extension</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_fish_%28The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy%29#Babel_fish\">Babelfish translation service</a> (itself named after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_fish_%28The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy%29#Babel_fish\">Babel fish from The Hitchhiker’s Guide</a>).</p>
<p>In this post I shall use the Tower of Babel in a somewhat more relevant and specific way: It will speak about multilingualism and about Babel itself.</p>
<p>This is how most people saw the Wikipedia article about the Tower of Babel until today:</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2183\" style=\"width: 461px;\"><a href=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-tofu1.png\"><img alt=\"The Tower of Babel article. Notice the pointless squares in the Akkadian name. They are called \"tofu\" in the jargon on internationalization programmers.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2183\" src=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-tofu1.png?w=500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The tower of Babel. Notice the pointless squares in the Akkadian name. They are called “tofu” in the jargon on internationalization programmers.</p></div>
<p>And this is how most people will see it from today:</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2184\" style=\"width: 479px;\"><a href=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-cuneiform.png\"><img alt=\"And we have the name written in real Akkadian cuneiform!\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2184\" src=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-cuneiform.png?w=500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">And we have the name written in real Akkadian cuneiform!</p></div>
<p>Notice how the Akkadian name now appears as actual Akkadian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform\">cuneiform</a>, and not as meaningless squares. Even if you, like most people, cannot actually read cuneiform, you probably understand that showing it this way is more correct, useful and educational.</p>
<p>This is possible thanks to the webfonts technology, which was enabled on the English Wikipedia today. It was already enabled in Wikipedias in some languages for many months, mostly in languages of India, which have severe problems with font support in the common operating systems, but now it’s available in the English Wikipedia, where it mostly serves to show parts of text that are written in exotic fonts.</p>
<p>The current iteration of the webfonts support in Wikipedia is part of a larger project: the Universal Language Selector (ULS). I am very proud to be one of its developers. My team in Wikimedia developed it over the last year or so, during which it underwent a rigorous process of design, testing with dozens of users from different countries, development, bug fixing and deployment. In addition to webfonts it provides an easy way to pick the user interface language, and to type in non-English languages (the latter feature is disabled by default in the English Wikipedia; to enable it, click the cog icon near “Languages” in the sidebar, then click “Input” and “Enable input tools”). In the future it will provide even more abilities, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>If you edit Wikipedia, or want to try editing it, one way in which you could help with the deployment of webfonts would be to make sure that all foreign strings in Wikipedia are marked with the appropriate HTML lang attribute; for example, that every Vietnamese string is marked as <span lang=”vi” dir=”ltr”>. This will help the software apply the webfonts correctly, and in the future it will also help spelling and hyphenation software, etc.</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be possible without the help of many, many people. The developers of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Opera, who developed the support for webfonts in these browsers; The people in Wikimedia who designed and developed the ULS: Alolita Sharma, Arun Ganesh, Brandon Harris, Niklas Laxström, Pau Giner, Santhosh Thottingal and Siebrand Mazeland; The many volunteers who tested ULS and reported useful bugs; The people in Unicode, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Everson\">Michael Everson</a>, who work hard to give a number to every letter in every imaginable alphabet and make massive online multilingualism possible; And last but not least, the talented and generous people who developed all those fonts for the different scripts and released them under Free licenses. I send you all my deep appreciation, as a developer and as a reader of Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Improvements resulting from this work include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration\">text-decoration</a>’ property is now honoured, so underlines, strike-throughs and overlines are painted.</li>

<li>Text can be selected with the mouse.</li>
<li>Layout of bidirectional text when there are multiple child nodes of a <code><text></code> element is now correct.</li>
<li>The ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space\">white-space</a>’ property now applies to SVG text.  In the future, in SVG 2, ‘white-space’ will be recommended method to control white space handling rather than <code>xml:space=\"\"</code>.  ‘white-space’ can be used to render manually wrapped text when using the <code>pre</code> and <code>pre-line</code> values.  ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height\">line-height</a>’ is used to determine the spacing between lines.</li>
<li>Various <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-fonts/\">CSS3 Font properties</a>, including the new ‘font-variant’ related properties to turn on and off OpenType features, now apply to SVG text.</li>
<li>The <code>:first-letter</code> and <code>:first-line</code> pseudo-elements now apply to SVG text.</li>

I had recently joined Mozilla, and about one or two months in, a wiki page surfaced. It was called <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2g\">B2G</a>.</p>
<h3>The beginning</h3>
<p>B2G stod for Boot to Gecko, a name implying that you would boot into Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, and a codename that stuck around for about a year. Apparently it was about building a mobile operating system based on, and targeted at, the Open Web. The wiki page took most of us by surprise, including our Press  and Evangelism team, since it got some traction in press before we got briefed about what it actually was. We scurried around and had meetings to come to a conclusion to what it actually was.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://robertnyman.com/images/1307/b2g-wiki-page.png\" /></p>
<p>Almost two years ago I wrote my first article for the Mozilla Hacks blog about it: <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/07/announcing-boot-to-gecko-b2g-booting-to-the-web/\">Announcing Boot to Gecko (B2G) – Booting to the Web</a>.</p>
<p>Over time, the project developed and a lot of things were ironed out, in establishing what the main focus would be, what the core undertaking encompassed and how to move forward.</p>
<h3>What it really is</h3>
<p>The idea with Firefox OS is to develop a mobile platform that is completely open, and which gives a lot more possibilities to developers, partners and, ultimately, consumers. As I’ve stated many times, the idea is not to compete with iPhones and high-end Android phones, but rather to offer an alternative to emerging markets. How can people who have no phones, or old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone\">feature phones</a>, get access to a smartphone for a really low cost?</p>
<p>How can we continue to ensure that the Internet is as democratic as it can be, that as many as possible can take part and contribute without having to pay many hundreds of US dollars to just get in through the front door?</p>
<p>There’s an estimate of two billion (!) more people coming online in the next few years, and a vast majority of them will do it through mobile. How can we help them, give them affordable options?</p>
<p>We at Mozilla believe we can do that through a completely open device, enabling everyone to contribute to it, afford it and also inspire and influence other players in the mobile field to make their devices more open, more powerful when it comes to the Open Web and priced at a realistic level.</p>
<h4>True open source</h4>
<p>From day one, the repository was available on GitHub. Day one. Everything that has been developed since then has been real-time, and possible for anyone to see, analyze and contribute to. The project first lived in a person’s own repository, but was then moved into a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G\">Mozilla one</a>.</p>
<h3>Introducing WebAPIs</h3>
<p>My own belief – and I’ve stated this many times – is that where I personally think Apple took the wrong path was with how to build things for the iPhone. With the first version they said that all should be the web and you could access it through the mobile Safari web browser. The problem was, of course, that no web site could access anything on the device, like contacts, camera etc. Basically, while the iPhone was a massive leap forward for mobile phones, developers were less than excited with the lack of possibilities for them to build things.</p>
<p>Then Apple went down the path with Objective-C, The App Store and the rest is history. I much more wish that they had chosen to make the web part much stronger, give it access to local device APIs and evolve into the powerful platform it deserves to be. But alas, that didn’t happen, and they went with their own closed and proprietary approach.</p>
<p>So, someone else had to make it happen. In August of 2011, I wrote the <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/08/introducing-webapi/\">first blog post about our WebAPIs iniative at Mozilla</a>, which targeted just that need of improving access for the web layer. Since then I’ve written a number of articles about various APIs and our dedication to standardize these – because if we only did it for us, we wouldn’t do the best for the Open Web.</p>
<p>My most extensive post on APIs was <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/02/using-webapis-to-make-the-web-layer-more-capable/\">Using WebAPIs to make the web layer more capable</a>, which I believe is a good introduction to just how many things you can do from the web layer.</p>
<h3>Apps – what are they and do we need them?</h3>
<p>With Apple’s move with the App Store, <em>everyone</em> wanted to create their own store, where they had complete control, their own APIs and with the goal of making a lot of money. Which is fair, they are businesses and they protect their interests.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe the web and just using URLs to get something is the most powerful thing we have, and something we should cherish and protect for the future. And then if you need a shortcut (bookmarks, anyone?) you can add a web page/URL to your home screen and that’s it.</p>
<p>Users will gain from this and developers will need to build with one technology – the web – instead of having a separate team for each mobile platform. With Firefox OS, the goal has not been to have developers learn something from scratch, but rather utilize and reuse heir existing Open Web technologies.</p>
<p>Since user’s have gotten so used to apps, we are offering that possibility in Firefox OS as well, but have made sure that it’s based on the Open Web (I’ve written more in detail about this in <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/02/getting-started-with-open-web-apps-why-and-how/\">Getting started with Open Web Apps – why and how</a>).</p>
<p>We also have a <a href=\"https://marketplace.firefox.com/\">Firefox Marketplace</a> where you can submit your apps, for findability, payments and more. What’s crucial to know here, though is that you don’t have to build an app if you don’t want to, you don’t have to use the Marketplace – apps are installable from anywhere. Over time, we hope that other people can create their own dedicated Marketplaces as well, for certain topics or local interests.</p>
<p>You could just as well continue to build your own mobile HTML5 web site – with Responsive Design, of course – and you will be good to go on Firefox OS. I see apps an optional approach, not the one and only. The choice is <em>yours</em>.</p>
<h4>Finding mobile web sites that are only on the web</h4>
<p>Also, for users, if you swipe to the left from the home screen in Firefox OS, you will get to the <a href=\"http://blog.everything.me/2013/02/25/exciting-times-at-everything-me/\">integrated Everything.me service</a> – finding mobile web sites out there that you can test first, and then pin to your home screen if you want to.</p>
<h3>Along came Web Activities</h3>
<p>With above mentioned WebAPIs, there are some things on a mobile that are to sensitive to expose and give complete access to, like telephony or SMS. But, naturally there are use cases where you’d want to trigger and interact with them from your content or app. Therefore, we <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/01/introducing-web-activities/\">introduced Web Activities</a>, which gives you a simple and powerful way to do just that, and with a connected user experience and approval.</p>
<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://robertnyman.com/images/1307/Web-Activities.png\" /></p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>It has also been interesting to see how tools and options have developed, to test this open platform in a simple and lightweight manner. I’m tremendously grateful for the work by Myk Melez and others on the <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/firefox-os-simulator-3-0-released/\">Firefox OS Simulator</a>, and I’ve happy to have been able to help developers by creating the <a href=\"https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App\">Firefox OS Boilerplate App</a> – all based on developers’ needs and input.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App-new-UI.png\" /></a></p>
<h3>When it took off</h3>
<p>When it really got exciting, and things started to take off, was about six months after the initial announcement. It was time for the massive <a href=\"http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/\">Mobile World Conference</a> in Barcelona, <em>the</em> place to be at if you were doing something in the mobile sector.</p>
<p>I watched it from afar, and tried to assist the announcements and attention with writing about it in <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/mozillas-boot-to-gecko-the-web-is-the-platform/\">Mozilla’s Boot to Gecko – The Web is the Platform</a> and <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/gaia-mozillas-user-interface-for-boot-to-gecko-all-web-technologies/\">Gaia, Mozilla’s user interface for Boot to Gecko – all web technologies</a>. It gained an enormous interest and from then, it has been busy days.</p>
<h3>Mobile World Conference, anno 2013</h3>
<p>This year I decided to go to Mobile World Congress, I had to be a part of what was going on. And it was such a wonderful and extremely intense experience! Working from early morning till <em>late</em> nights, talking, learning, sharing. It was wonderful to see all the interest and hope around Firefox OS, something that I believe must be somewhat akin to the 1.0 release of Firefox. How can we create something open and make a difference?</p>

<h3>Today’s the day</h3>
<p>Yesterday <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/07/01/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">we announced that the first Firefox OS devices are coming into the market</a>, and today the very first devices will be available for sale in Madrid, Spain. There are a number of other countries and places to be announced in the very near future, and with a lot of hardware and operator partners, this is so exciting!</p>
<p>There has been so much hard work by so many people going into this: to make it work, to get through the hard times, to seal the the deals, to understand, educate and inspire developers. A lot of effort has gone into this, but for me, I don’t regret one second. And <strong>thank you</strong> to eveyone for all your contributions to this project!</p>
<p>I was there day one. I was along for the entire ride, from the first code commit to seeing the actual devices being launched, to people owning them. It has been a magic experience, and frankly, I’m a bit touched. Within one’s career, I don’t believe many get the chances to be there from the initial spark to the the launch of a completely new mobile operating system.</p>
<p>And this is not the end. It has just begun.</p>

I figured it was about time I'd update people reading along with some of the stuff that I've been working on lately(of course with the help of the rest of the Graphics team and others!). I will be using the term Moz2D in this post to refer to our new graphics API that was formerly known under the name 'Azure'.</p>
<p><strong>Moz2D Stand-Alone Build & Repository</strong></p>
<p>In order to make it easier for both ourselves, partners and potential 3rd parties interested in using Moz2D to build and work with the Moz2D API, I now have a stand-alone repository that contains the Moz2D basic library code, the player and some testing applications. The exact status of this repository is still to be determined, and no automation is applied to it yet, however we are making sure it keeps building and remains up to date! It can be found <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/users/bschouten_mozilla.com/moz2d/\">here</a>. Some basic build instructions are available <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX#Testing.2C_replaying.2C_building_Moz2D\">here</a>, I will try to post more detailed build information, also for the different dependencies such as Cairo and Skia, somewhere in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Direct2D 1.1 Integration</strong></p>
<p>We've been working towards a Direct2D 1.1 backend in Moz2D. Direct2D 1.1 was included with Windows 8 and is provided as an update to Windows 7 users. It includes a wide range of API additions, several of which give us the ability to implement the Moz2D feature set with reduced and cleaner code. In addition to that some of the API additions should promise some performance improvements. We have refrained from using some of the new APIs in the Direct2D 1.1 implementation as of yet however, since at the moment they seem to increase the complexity without offering the expected performance benefits. As we begin rolling out Direct2D 1.1 integration to actual firefox users I'll attempt to provide more information on what we discover along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Moz2D Recording & Performance Analysis Improvements</strong></p>
<p>Another thing that we've been working on has been increased recording abilities as well as an increased ability to get useful information out of these recordings. Although the priority for this has been relatively low, steady improvements are being made and it has proven to be a large asset in the creation of new Moz2D backends.</p>
<p>First of all it's now possible to create a recording of a specific page using a single command when using Firefox nightly, an example looks like this (assuming 'recording' is a valid, clean profile of firefox):</p>
<blockquote><p>firefox -no-remote -P recording -recording file://C:\\Users\\Bas\\Dev\\mytest.html -recording-output mytest.aer</p></blockquote>
<p>We're currently still working out some problems which will often cause recordings to be terminated prematurely and therefore come up empty. But this should be fairly easy to fix. Do note this needs to be done on a system where Moz2D content is enabled, for now, this is only windows, although it should soon include OS X as well!</p>
<p>Once the recording is completed several (experimental) possibilities have been added. First of all the Moz2D player has gotten additional features, see a screenshot below for the updated look:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.basschouten.com/media/blogs/blog/azure/player2dscr.png\"><img alt=\"Player2D Screenshot\" src=\"http://www.basschouten.com/media/blogs/blog/azure/player2dscr.png\" title=\"Player 2D (click for a larger version!)\" width=\"450\" /><br />Click for a larger version</a></p>
<p>Note that it's now possible to replay the recording with different drawing backends (depending on your build). This easily makes it possible when adding backends to find flaws in new implementations by comparing drawing results with established backends. We've also added the possibility to analyze timings on a per-call basis to find performance bottlenecks for different backends. In addition to that a separate application called 'recordbench' has been added which is in a very early stage, this essentially is a very simple tool that reports timings for a recording across a range of backends. Trough this application we should be able to do automated performance comparisons between different drawing backends.</p>
<p>Finally we've added a micro-benchmark suite that allows us to make detailed performance comparisons on a per-backend basis. The intention of all this being to give us the ability to make well-informed decisions in the future as to what drawing backends to prefer on specific platforms/configurations.</p>
<p>This isn't necessarily all that we've been doing and I'll do my best to provide additional updates in the near future!</p><div class=\"item_footer\"><p><small><a href=\"http://www.basschouten.com/blog1.php/progress-on-moz2d\">Original post</a> blogged on <a href=\"http://b2evolution.net/\">b2evolution</a>.</small></p></div>" nil nil "b1858f4fce08ae0199dfa7f72fb5ff5d") (184 (20946 37587 459965) "http://oduinn.com/blog/2013/07/02/triumph-tr3-in-san-francisco/" "John O'Duinn: Triumph TR3 in San Francisco" "John" "Tue, 02 Jul 2013 07:53:48 +0000" "<p>Walking to a neighborhood coffeeshop, I found this immaculate Triumph TR3 parked on a side street near my house.</p>

The performance team also joined us as there are various joint projects between our teams. After the week is over it’s interesting to look back and see what was accomplished during the week and what it opened as guidance for our future work. Here is my personal recap, some of the highlights of what I did and what I saw during the week. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally met with Irving, with whom I’ve been working in the past few months in our project to move the Add-ons Manager storage from SQLite to JSON and making it off-main-thread (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853389\">bug 853389</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853388\">bug 853388</a>)</li>
<li>We did a triage of performance-related bugs to classify them into high impact and low impact and figure out where to focus</li>
<li>Got to see some of the great progress that Tim Taubert and Avi has done on the tabstrip animations and got Tim to help me use the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=453650\">reflow observers</a> to do some experiments of my own in the UI. I didn’t find any obvious low hanging fruits, which is expected since he has fixed various offenders since introducing these reflows observers, but the attempt was worthwhile</li>
<li>Using the profiler I noticed some long stacks for text reflowing during tab animations, but these didn’t translate into any measurable slowness. In any case, I started some hacking to see if it was possible to improve it anyway. The issue is that the title in a tab has to be constantly remeasured for cropping while a tab opening animation is happening. I wrote a patch to only display the tab title and favicon after the animation has completed, and then got together with Avi to run his tab animation FPS tests and see what changes. The answer was: not much, there were no visible gains. In hindsight, there’s an obvious reason: even though we can hide the text in the tab that is opening, we can’t do it for the other open tabs, which will all be potentially shrinking and re-cropping at the same time. However, the investigation was very useful nonetheless, because we discovered two issues with the APIs used to measure the FPS on Mac: a telemetry measurement have been inactive since OMTC has been activated; and the framerate was always stuck on vsynced even with different values for layout.frame_rate (which is useful to tweak when doing animation stress tests)</li>
<li>Got together with Paolo to discuss the plans and current state of the Downloads API off-main-thread project, which I’ll be joining to help (starting with <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=852482\">bug 852482</a>)</li>
<li>Watched Vladan present his findings about <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/vdjeric/2013/05/01/running-nightly-23-from-an-sd-card/\">running Firefox on an SD card</a>. I had already seem the video through his blog post but watching it again and going into more details was very interesting, as the extreme slow disk IO is not only an artificial case produced on SD cards, but also something that many users have to face daily on machines with older hard drives and anti-virus software than can significantly worsen the problems.</li>
<li>Vladan’s talk was also of particular interest to me as it serves as motivation and validation for the work I’ve been involved with in the last significant number of months: the Add-ons Manager work and now the Downloads API.</li>
<li>And various converstations about <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis\">Electrolysis</a>, including a good talk with Yoric to understand how the ongoing work on session restore and e10s will interact</li>
</ul>
<p>And beyond that there were also various other topics that benefited from having the team all together in one place, specially Social API and Australis. To me personally the week was immensely helpful as a motivator and as a way to get consensus and clarity into our upcoming projects, not to mention the fine chance of directly interacting with the entire team which not often happens as we’re all spread around the around!</p>
<p>As a side note, this blog post was an exercise in itself as one of the outcomes for me from the Summit Assembly meeeting we had at the week before. There’s more on it that needs a separate blog post to explain, but a personal action that I’ve taken from that event is to increase the transparency and involvement with the community about the work I do.</p>

<p>I just switched from an Android phablet made by Samsung, device I came to hate for many reasons, to a Firefox OS Geeksphone Keon. That was my second Android phone, I switched because I got it for free<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/pnote-839-1\" id=\"rev-pnote-839-1\">1</a>]</sup>, needed a carrier that worked better than the failure that is WIND Mobile on which I was using my Nexus One<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/pnote-839-2\" id=\"rev-pnote-839-2\">2</a>]</sup> and said Nexus One was just abandoned in OS upgrade by HTC AND Google after 22 month. I have to admit I missed the Nexus One, still, as Samsung didn't make Android better, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Back to the point. I got that Geeksphone Keon, provided by my employer: Mozilla.</p>
<p>This is not a review of the phone, BTW, and all of this also applies to the <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/07/01/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">just released Firefox OS phone in Spain</a>.</p>
<p>On my Android phablet<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/pnote-839-3\" id=\"rev-pnote-839-3\">3</a>]</sup> I used 4 applications: the web browser, a twitter client (not Twitter's own though), Instagram and Foursquare.</p>
<p>On my Firefox OS phone, I had to scrap the last two. Why? Because despite requiring an internet connection and having some sort of web interface, their are unusable on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Web browser</strong></p>
<p>On Android I used Firefox for Android as my web browser. It is currently the best solution for web browsing is designed to protect your privacy and to run on more devices than Google's own Chrome. Call me biased if you want but truth is I have been using Firefox on the desktop too.</p>
<p>Firefox OS web browser is basically the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong></p>
<p>Twitter is a bit hurtfull. It is designed from the ground up to be used as a web application. Twitter has a mobile version that is meant to work well on small screen. They even have a packaged version for the Firefox OS Marketplace. Where it hurts is that Twitter web UI remains awful, either deliberately (given that the iOS client is awfull too) or because we got spoiled by third-party clients. On Android I was using Twicca (no source code) or Twidere (broke a bit at one point), but it should be noted that Twitter gave the finger to third parties when they added restriction on the development of client ; as well as bickering with Instagram to not show their content inline.</p>
<p>They get almost full marks for being a web app and treating it as first class.</p>
<p><strong>Foursquare</strong></p>
<p>On the desktop, if you go to Foursquare you get a decent web application, albeit you can do the major feature that Foursquare calls for: check-in.</p>
<p>On mobile, if I visit the website on Firefox for Android I get prompted to download an app.</p>
<p>On Firefox OS it is worse. Looks like their detection fail and they offer the desktop website that is mostly unusable on such a small screen. I filed <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=878132\">bug 878132</a> for our tech evangelism to eventually have a look at.</p>
<p>Seems like they didn't go all the way to make it relevant on mobile web. Sadly. What was an experiment I started by the end of last year when I signed up for the service stopped here right at Firefox OS. It seems that I don't need it. They lost a user.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong></p>
<p>This one is the worst of the worst. First and foremost their web interface for desktop is very limited. Secondly, it doesn't scale at all on mobile - some content scale better than other. Third, they bickered with Twitter so that their content is not viewable inline.</p>
<p>Why does that last one matter? Try viewing the instagram content in the Twitter mobile web client.</p>
<p>I give a F as a mark.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Simply make your mobile app web based. It will run on iOS, Android, Firefox OS, Blackberry, etc. and people will be able to follow when they change phone and you won't need to spend a lot of resources for each platforms.</p>

The Learning team has been reorganised (twice!) so I’m now on the Badges Team v2.0. Things certainly don’t move slowly in the tech world.</p>

<p>Initially, I planned for this post to include an epic infographic showing all of the places I’ve been, the people I’ve talked to, and so on. But that task would take a whole day of my time – and that’s time I haven’t got! Working at Mozilla is exciting, but busy. Suffice to say that <strong>I’ve attended 53 events in the 52 weeks I’ve been at Mozilla</strong> and I’ve usually been speaking at or running workshops at them. When you factor in Christmas shutdown at PTO (a.k.a. holiday) then that’s pretty impressive/scary.</p>
<p>I’ve been many places this past year evangelising Mozilla’s mission and, in particular, the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI). I’ve been to Canada (twice), several places in the US, the Netherlands (twice), Belgium, Portugal, Ireland, all over the UK… the list goes on. That sounds great but, as any business traveller will tell you, you don’t usually get to do the touristy things; most of what you see is the inside of airports, hotels, planes, trains and automobiles. Having said that, it beats sitting at the same desk day-in, day-out. <img alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> </p>

<p>I’m often asked what it’s like to work for Mozilla. As people ask that question their eyes often light up as if it’s a magic wonderland. It’s <em>not</em> unicorns and rainbows all the time and I certainly recognise the ‘inability to switch off’ problem that Rob Hawkes mentioned in his post upon <a href=\"http://rawkes.com/articles/on-leaving-mozilla\">leaving Mozilla</a>. In that post he talked about stress and burnout as well. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it) I experienced stress, burnout and working crazy hours as a teacher and senior leader while still in my 20′s. That means both I and my family are well-equipped to spot and deal with the tell-tale signs of stress. I know when to rest and how to look after myself these days.</p>
<p>But working at Mozilla is, if not a magic wonderland, certainly <em>different </em>and<em> pretty awesome</em>. I’ve never experienced such freedom and devolved responsibility as I do here. Nor have I ever worked with people who are so talented, motivated and great at communicating using technology. It’s also wonderful knowing that you’re playing a part in making a difference on a global scale. <em>Especially</em> with the work that I’m involved in around <a href=\"http://openbadges.org\">Open Badges</a> and the <a href=\"http://mzl.la/weblitstd\">Web Literacy Standard</a> I feel like this is stuff that could significantly improve the educational and career opportunities of the next generation. Given that’s my children’s generation, it makes me proud to work for a global non-profit where <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/\">doing good is part of our code</a>.</p>

When enterprises (and others) are customizing Firefox, I get asked pretty much the same questions every time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I disable private browsing?</li>
<li>How do I turn off Firefox Sync?</li>
<li>How do I prevent access to about:config?</li>
<li>How do I prevent the installation of add-ons?</li>
<li>How do I prevent access to the add-ons manager?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Doing any of these things properly is actually quite difficult, because none of the people that developed these features ever thought that someone would want to disable them. I think the primary reason for this is that most people that create software have only ever experienced how one type of person uses a computer. They believe that everyone uses a computer like they do; they have full access to the computer, they can do whatever they want and they can customize the computer however they want. This narrow view causes them to create software for people like them.
</p>
<p>
The reality is that people use computers in many different ways. In many industries, organizations, governments and educational institutions, there is a need to prevent people from having too much access to the computer and the browser. And it's not just things like kiosks. It could be shared computers at a hospital or bank, or it could be simply that the employees are not very computer literate and you want to make sure they have limited access. Or maybe the browser is used on a piece of equipment and you want to make sure it can't be messed with. There are tons of reasons why someone would want to disable certain features.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you create a new feature, you should ask yourself this questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there a good reason why someone would want to disable this feature?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is yes, you should provide a single global preference that removes the entire feature. You should also ensure that when this preference is locked, any associated UI associated with that feature is disabled.
</p>
<p>
Asking this simple question before implementing a new feature will go a long way towards making sure Firefox is enterprise ready.</p>" nil nil "73a3d6ab3a09bcda1febc005e255800f") (176 (20946 37587 450676) "http://ednapiranha.com/2013/you-wont-know-unless-you-try/" "Jen Fong-Adwent: You Won't Know Unless You Try" nil "Mon, 01 Jul 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "Everyone has at least one idea.

<p></p>
<p>I’ve said this many times before, but let me now here repeat the things that really get me excited like a 5 year old on sugar rush about Firefox OS:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Firefox OS kills the idea of mobile web connectivity only being for the rich in the western world.</strong> Yes, for us in the US or the UK having a new shiny phone every half year is not an issue as companies are killing each other trying to underbid the price and offers of the others. But a usable Android that is not generations behind and hard-wired to a terrible stock browser or an iPhone is just not affordable to everyone. Even worse, if you have no credit card you couldn’t even buy apps for them. This is unfair, elitist and plainly against anything the web stands for. FirefoxOS is affordable, and apps can be bought on prepay or on your phone bill and the OS is the browser which means updates are easy</li><li><strong>FirefoxOS does not assume a fast, stable and always available connection</strong>. When traveling I start hating my Android phone which I love to bits otherwise. Having dozens of megabyte updates over roaming is out of the question and neither is using flaky and slow wireless connections. Firefox OS has no native apps – all of them, including the system apps are written in <span class=\"caps\">HTML</span>, CSS and JavaScript. Thus they are much smaller and can have atomic updates instead of having to be replaced as a unit every single time.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS is the web in your pocket.</strong> It is Firefox and nothing else (other than a Linux core to access the hardware). Thus I will not be told to “download the native app” when I go to web sites that are perfectly fine to use.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS is the platform <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> deserves</strong> For developers, our <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> solutions are finally first-class citizens. We are not shoved into a slower web view and told we can not access the hardware.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS apps are web distributed apps.</strong> Users can go to the marketplace and find our apps by hand or via review or they could search for a certain song, movie, football team and dish and find our app that way. App discovery is as simple as using the web and finding web sites. Instead of having to pay as a developer and be at the mercy of the T&C of closed marketplaces I can publish a Firefox OS app by adding a button and calling the open web apps <span class=\"caps\">API</span>. That way my current web site is the ad for my app and all my visitors potential app users.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>All of this is obvious to me as a geek but doesn’t mean anything if we don’t get devices in the hands of end users. And this is what happens now – big time! Alcatel, <span class=\"caps\">ZTE</span>, Telefonica, Deutsche Telekom, Spain and Poland. The fox really is out of the bag now. And oh how it will roam and run into many other directions. Be part of this, as a web developer, it is the most rewarding platform that will not change from under you at the whim of company goals or shareholder demands.</p>

<p>Mozilla’s goal is to build openness, innovation, and opportunity into online life.   One of our biggest levers is of course building products.   We build products that provide a great user experience and engender openness, innovation and opportunity into the technology of the Web itself.</p>
<p>Firefox has done this in many ways.  Firefox was a pioneer in the world of open source consumer products, in open techniques for feedback, support, and quality, just to name a few examples.  We have always built Firefox to give developers huge opportunities for innovation in areas they care about.  We do not seek to control the ways developers can innovate, or the way people take control of their software.</p>
<p>As a result, Firefox helped usher in a whole new era of Web computing, bringing new experiences for users and new freedoms for developers.  Today Firefox continues to pioneer new technologies and features that benefit users.  Some recent examples include features such as Do Not Track, which allows people to tell websites they do not wish to be tracked around the Web, and our Social API that makes the browsing experience more personal and customizable.</p>
<p>With Firefox OS we hope to do something similar with the mobile computing environment.  We want to bring the power of the open Web to this world.  We want to bring the same kinds of flexibility, opportunity and freedom to this computing environment that the original Firefox brings to the desktop.  More specifically, we want  Firefox OS to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prove that the Web is the platform, surprise people with what HTML5 is capable of on mobile devices.</li>
<li>Advance adoption of mobile Web standards and APIs across the industry, including on other operating systems.</li>
<li>Spur developer innovation; break the mold of what a mobile app is capable of.</li>
<li>Make the open Web accessible to more people.</li>
<li>Spur competition in making the Web the platform for mobile computing.</li>
<li>Excite people.</li>
<li>Provide a powerful, exciting and open alternative to the current closed ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll note that I haven’t included something like “we want to ship X numbers of phones.”  Ultimately, we want enough people choosing Firefox OS to confirm we’ve built a great product and to move us toward  a more open mobile computing platform based on the Web.    Our goal is to provide an alternative that has a deep and exciting user experience based on openness, choice and competition.</p>" nil nil "b2ad1bc6be718225ed0961606fa07a27") (172 (20945 21910 604326) "http://mcc.id.au/blog/2013/07/firefox-svg-text-improvements" "Cameron McCormack: Improved SVG text support in Firefox Nightly" "Cameron McCormack" "Mon, 01 Jul 2013 08:48:19 +0000" "<p>On the weekend, I landed the final patch in what turned out to be quite a long running project to overhaul Firefox’s SVG text support to reuse the same text layout and rendering code that it uses for HTML.

<li>The ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space\">white-space</a>’ property now applies to SVG text.  In the future, in SVG 2, ‘white-space’ will be recommended method to control white space handling rather than <code>xml:space=\"\"</code>.  ‘white-space’ can be used to render manually wrapped text when using the <code>pre</code> and <code>pre-line</code> values.  ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height\">line-height</a>’ is used to determine the spacing between lines.</li>

The data collected was largely what we call <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis\">traffic analysis</a></em> data: who talked to whom, where, when, using what mechanism.  It was mostly <em>not</em> the actual contents of the conversations, but so much can be deduced from “who talked to whom, when” that this should not reassure you in the slightest.  If you haven’t seen the demonstration that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/06/prism_metadata_analysis_paul_revere_identified_by_his_connections_to_other.single.html\">just by compiling and correlating membership lists, the British government could have known that Paul Revere would’ve been a good person to ask pointed questions about revolutionary plots in the colonies in 1772</a>, go read that now.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s safe to assume we know <em>anything</em> about the <em>details</em> of this data collection: especially not the degree of cooperation the government obtained from telcos and other private organizations.  There are too many layers of secrecy involved, there’s probably no one who has the complete picture of what the various three-letter agencies were <em>supposed</em> to be doing (let alone what they actually <em>were</em> doing), and there’s too many people trying to bend the narrative in their own preferred direction.  However, I also don’t think the details matter all that much at this stage.  That the program existed, and was successful enough that the NSA was bragging about it in an internal PowerPoint deck, is enough for the immediate conversation to go forward.  (The details may become very important later, though: especially details about who got to make use of the data collected.)</p>
<p>Lots of other people have been writing about why this program is a Bad Thing: Most critically, large traffic-analytic databases are <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/174851/strange-case-barrett-brown#ixzz2X1oYM1xV\">easy to abuse for politically-motivated witch hunts</a>, which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover#Investigation_of_subversion_and_radicals\">can and have occurred in the US in the past</a>, and arguably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/26/nsa-revelations-response-to-smears\">are now occurring as a reaction to the leaks</a>.  One might also be concerned that this <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/06/preventing_cell.html\">makes it harder to pursue other security goals</a>; that it gives other countries an incentive to partition the Internet along national boundaries, <a href=\"http://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2013/06/provoking-national-boundaries-internet-chilling-thought\">harming its resilience</a>; or that it <a href=\"https://medium.com/surveillance-state/f77088fd4c28\">further harms the US’s image abroad</a>, which was already not doing that well; or that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/29/tomorrows-surveillance/\">the <em>next</em> surveillance program will be even worse if this one isn’t stopped</a>.
(Nothing new under the sun: Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis’ argument in “<a href=\"http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/Brandeisprivacy.htm\">The Right to Privacy</a>” in 1890 is still as good an explanation as any you’ll find of why the government should not spy on the general public.)</p>
<p>I want to talk about something a little different; I want to talk about why the <em>secrecy</em> of these ubiquitous surveillance programs is at least as harmful to good governance as the programs themselves.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://www.owlfolio.org/media/2013/06/loose-lips-sink-ships-posters2.jpg\"><img alt=\"World War II-era propaganda poster of sinking steamship with the words “Loose LIPS Sink Ships” superimposed.\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1514\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.owlfolio.org/media/2013/06/loose-lips-sink-ships-posters2-196x300.jpg\" width=\"196\" /></a></p>
<p>If you’ve had any exposure at all to the US military-industrial complex, you will have noticed two things: its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/jun/12/prism-nsa-powerpoint-graphic-design\">institutional idiom of horrible PowerPoint slide decks</a>, and its obsession with secrecy. No doubt this started with the entirely appropriate goal of <em>operational</em> secrecy: you don’t make it easy for the enemy to find and sink your troopships. But secrecy is contagious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you decide that something is so dangerous that the entire world
hinges on keeping it under control, this sense of fear and dread
starts to creep outwards. The worry about what must be controlled
becomes insatiable—and pretty soon the mundane is included with
the existential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so <a href=\"http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/2012/08/29/forbidden-spheres/\">all round objects become classified</a>. (quote is from linked article) This culture of secrecy is especially obvious where nuclear bombs are concerned, but it pervades every part of the complex, even to the groups and organizations that aren’t doing anything that’s formally secret. The default action is not to talk, and the default policy is to lock up the files. Publishing one’s research is an unusual action that must be justified and approved. Going on public record about an agency’s plans and activities is positively aberrant. I think this is why the US government collectively, quite a few officials personally, an awful lot of reporters in <a href=\"http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/yearning-to-be-subjects-journalist.html\">the “establishment” news media</a>,  and <a href=\"http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2013/06/one-of-things-i-find-most-fascinating.html\">a truly depressing number of private citizens</a>, have been acting as if <em>reporting that spying is going on</em> is far, far worse than the spying itself. In the mind of someone invested in secrecy culture, leaking a secret is worse than anything. It <em>isn’t done</em>.  And what with the military-industrial complex being the single largest employer in the country, and its attitudes trickling down to state and local government as well, it wouldn’t surprise me if nearly every citizen has had <em>some</em> contact with secrecy culture.</p>
<p>This hit me personally last weekend. I was at my grandmother’s 90th birthday party and one of my relatives wanted to know what I thought of the news. The conversation went around in circles for a while because we were both agreeing with each other that we were disgusted that such a thing could happen, but it turned out that <em>I</em> was disgusted by the spying and <em>he</em> was disgusted by the government’s failure to keep the spying secret.  Once this became clear, I said to him that I didn’t think the spying should have been secret in the first place, and that made so little sense to him that it ended the conversation.</p>
<h3>Kerckhoffs’ Principle</h3>
<p>The thing is, too much secrecy turns out to be self-defeating. This is well-understood in cryptography; it is the famous principle proposed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Kerckhoffs\">Auguste Kerckhoffs</a> in 1883:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The system [that is, the algorithm for encrypting messages] must not
be required to be secret. It must be able to fall into the hands of
the enemy without  inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is counterintuitive. Why <em>wouldn’t</em> you conceal your encryption algorithm from the enemy? Indeed, even though Kerckhoffs wrote in 1883, up till about 1977 everyone did just that, believing that it couldn’t <em>hurt</em>. And some people, not to mention some major industrial standards organizations who ought to know better, still do. Unfortunately, it turns out that it <em>does</em> hurt.  Cryptographic algorithms are difficult to design, and unforgiving of errors.  A design that hasn’t been vetted by lots of people is almost surely flawed.  If you publish an algorithm and invite feedback, you attract attention from many more cryptographers than you could hope to employ internally, and they’ll tell you when they find a problem.  Meantime, <em>whether or not</em> you publish an algorithm, the odds are that the enemy will find out how it works.  But when <em>they</em> find a flaw, they won’t tell you about it; they’ll just <em>use</em> it to read your messages. If you’re very lucky, before this happens, someone relatively well-disposed to you will discover your secret algorithm, find the flaws, and <a href=\"http://www.owlfolio.org/research/the-conference-formerly-known-as-oakland-day-1/#dont-trust-satellite-phones\">tell you about it in a highly public and embarrassing manner</a>.</p>
<p>But Kerckhoffs’ Principle is not just for cryptographic primitives.  It applies to network protocol design, which is very nearly as unforgiving, and not as codified: nowadays security analysts are far more likely to find a mistake in the way a protocol <em>uses</em> a cipher than to break the cipher itself.  It also applies to software in general: there’s a <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceschneier/2012/05/30/the-vulnerabilities-market-and-the-future-of-security/\">black market for “zero-day exploits”</a> (that is, not-yet-fixed security-critical bugs) in both open- and closed-source software, but open-source software attracts more attention from people who would rather see the bugs fixed, because open source (as a social phenomenon) is more inviting of experimentation and feedback.</p>
<p>We can generalize even further, past computer ’ware to other complex systems: such as nation-states and their governments.  The logic of Kerckhoff’s principle predicts that when a political decision <em>isn’t</em> made in public with full knowledge of the situation, it will be more likely to be a bad decision, specifically a decision which can be exploited.  Yet that is precisely the sort of decision making that secrecy culture demands.
If the NSA’s blanket surveillance programs had been public knowledge from the get-go, we could have <a href=\"https://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/06/13/3-questions-about-nsa-surveillance/\">asked pointed questions</a>, starting with “Is this worth the sacrifice of civil liberties?” but also including things like “Does this actually <em>work</em> against criminals who know their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradecraft\">tradecraft</a>?” and “You want <em>how much</em> money?” and of course “That wouldn’t happen to be your father’s brother’s nephew’s cousin’s former roommate’s defense contracting firm you’re proposing to hire, would it now?”</p>
<p>But they weren’t, and we didn’t, and oddly enough, it seems that we have spent <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_12744661\">billions of dollars</a> on a system which <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-23/u-s-surveillance-is-not-aimed-at-terrorists.html\"><em>doesn’t</em> work against competent criminals</a> but which invites <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/06/26/195045/memories-of-stasi-color-germans.html\">unflattering comparisons with the Stasi</a>.  Worse yet, the NSA’s surveillance programs look suspiciously like <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2013/06/07/u-s-never-really-ended-creepy-total-information-awareness-program/\">a continuation of the “Total Information Awareness” program that Congress axed in 2003</a>, which means the secrecy culture is prepared to <em>ignore</em> decisions by its elected overseers that don’t go its way, or twist arms behind the scenes till the decision is—secretly, of course—reversed.  At that point, can we call this a democracy anymore?</p>" nil nil "9e539136d4aa1f30f209f99d394baa4b") (170 (20945 14374 616329) "http://blog.mozilla.org/planet/2013/06/30/planet-additions-class-of-6302013/" "Planet Mozilla Blog: Planet Additions: Class Of 6/30/2013" "raccettura" "Sun, 30 Jun 2013 18:35:52 +0000" "<p><a href=\"http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/\">Michael Coates</a> (<a href=\"http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss\">feed</a>) – I currently have a <a href=\"http://michael-coates.blogspot.com/\">security blog</a> that is listed on planet based on my Mozilla tag.

On June 15th,  <a href=\"https://reps.mozilla.org/e/summit-planning-assembly/\">50 Mozillians</a> got together for a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/SummitPlanningAssembly\">planning session</a> and I discovered just how much Mozillians focus on getting great things done!</p>
<p>We met to help shape the Mozilla Summit (a 2,000 person conference happening later this year) in a way that would move Mozilla forward. We spent the first day talking about top issues and the second day planning out the topics and sessions.</p>

<p>Of all the trips I’ve taken this year, I think the Mozilla Summit Planning Assembly was the one I looked forward to most – a chance to help shape the future of Mozilla and have great conversations with people who are passionate about the same things I am! I also admit I was really worried that we were too big of a group to get anything done. Turns out I was not alone. We all showed up ready to set the content and agenda for the Mozilla Summit.</p>
<p><strong>A day of tough discussions and building trust</strong></p>
<p>We had some excellent conversations Friday night and Saturday. We did a number of different exercises designed to start conversations and pull out key themes. For example, we started out  Saturday with an “unpanel”. Four people sit in the middle of the group. They have a conversation. There’s an empty chair as well and whenever someone in the audience wants to join the conversation, they slide into the empty seat and one of the four sitting there self selects to go back to the bigger circle leaving an empty chair as an invitation for the next person. While at first it didn’t seem very different than a big group conversation where you passed around the mic, it turned out to be a great way to keep the audience engaged in the conversation. Every one was listening hard. The topics we covered were varied but a lot of it centered around non paid staff vs paid staff relationships – culture and responsibilities. We also talked about things like whether there’d be technical roadmap decisions made at the Summit, how people like to communicate, etc. One of the key takeaways for many of us was that we were all worried about similar issues!</p>
<p>Over the course of the day, <strong>two themes arose</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><strong>Old timers and new hires are having a hard time trusting each other at Mozilla.</strong> I’m sure I didn’t get all the nuances but it felt to me like old timers think new hires might not have the “Mozilla DNA” and might not have an appreciation for our mission and open source methods. And new hires think old timers are stuck and so concerned with consensus they aren’t always getting things done.  Over the weekend, I think we made great progress in killing that stereotype and building good relationships that bridge the gap. (<a href=\"http://lukasblakk.com/my-big-shift/\">Lukas Blakk wrote</a> about this experience as well.) I have to admit that personally I’m not sure where I fell on this stereotype other than feeling rather annoyed at both groups and some how personally responsible for both stereotypes. As a hiring manager, I’ve hired many of those new people. As a long time open source community member, I feel like it’s my job to make sure the “open source” way is considered and well represented.  I also think that part of the problem is how members of each group introduce themselves and represent themselves to the world – more on that later.</span></li>
<li><strong>Mozillians like to get stuff done!</strong> By the end of the day, we were all extremely uncomfortable with all of the discussions, panels and world cafe exercises with no clear idea of how it was going to produce an agenda for the Summit. Luckily our leaders and the Unconference organizers heard all of our concerns and when we turned up the second day, we got to create a rough outline of an agenda and topics for the Summit!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Getting down to work</strong></p>
<p>On the second day we did a “World Cafe” exercise. We had about 7 rooms and 3 time slots and everyone wrote in the topic they wanted to cover in one of the slots. We then did some consolidation and managed to squeeze everything into the ~20 slots.</p>
<p>The idea was to cover themes or topics we thought should be covered at the Mozilla Summit. Each session was to identify Session Title, Goals and Outcomes, People for Followup and What has to happen between now and the Summit. They were all captured in etherpads.</p>
<p>All the sessions I went to had great conversation. It was rather tricky to focus on how that topic would be covered at the Summit instead of just discussing the topic. We tried to focus on how the conversation would best happen at the Summit: what type of presentation it would be, how much should be a proposal vs a discussion, if it was one presentation or a theme, etc. Some times the topic you signed up for was not the topic your group ended up proposing. I attended discussions on communication, diversity (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mozdino\">Dino</a> and <a href=\"http://lukasblakk.com/\">Lukas</a> have a great diagram for a starting conversation!) and helping companies that aren’t used to “open” work with effectively with us.</p>
<p>Then <a href=\"https://commonspace.wordpress.com/\">Mark</a>, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/debbiecohen\">Debbie</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\">Mitchell</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/krnasz\">Kate</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2013/06/20/what-is-was/\">Mardi</a> grouped all of the topics into themes – interestingly “People” had the most topics. Other themes included Strategy, Product, Process and Purpose.</p>
<p>So now we have themes for the Summit. And a lot of proposed topics.</p>
<p>I found it really valuable to spend this time as a group planning for a big event. When you are going to bring 2,000 people together (in groups of 600) I think it’s essential to spend some time uncovering what the real issues that we need to discuss are.</p>
<p><strong>My take aways:</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the bigger goal of planning the Summit, I took away a few more key things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s important to <strong>work together, preferably in person</strong>. We built a lot of trust over the weekend – trust that would have taken much more time to build during our regular day-to-day lives and over the internet. I hope we can take that experience and bring it to the Mozilla Summit.</li>
<li>Mentors. After a conversation with <a href=\"http://diary.braniecki.net/\">Gandalf</a>, I came away thinking part of the solution might be <strong>holding mentors more accountable</strong> and some how measuring their success over time. We also discussed short term mentorship projects too.</li>
<li>How you introduce your self matters. With a few exceptions, most of the <strong>volunteer Mozillians introduced themselves as being “a community member”</strong> or a “Rep”. Most of <strong>paid staff introduced themselves by their functional role</strong> or team, “Firefox for Android”. This is natural as while we all feel like part of the greater Mozilla community, paid staff has in general been hired to do a particular role. But I feel like it’s a big part of the disconnect.</li>
<li><strong>Lots of communication formats</strong> are needed. <a href=\"http://lawrencemandel.com/\">Lawrence Mandel</a> pointed out that not everyone does well speaking in front of large groups at conferences, so whatever format the Summit takes, it needs to enable lots of communication vehicles, meetings, parties, irc, etherpads, newsgroups, … a way for everyone to find enough of their comfort zone so that they can be comfortable enough to participate fully.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Mozilla Summit Planning Assembly was one of the trips I was most looking forward to attending this year and it lived up to my expectations! I’m very excited for the Summit now! (And for all the planning that still has to happen before then!)</p>

<a href=\"https://login.persona.org\">Persona</a> conversations. As part of an
<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/2013/Auth_Jam_Session\">Auth Jam session</a>, a few of us explored the idea of adding
non-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth\">OAuth</a>-based authentication mechanisms to
<a href=\"https://indieauth.com\">IndieAuth</a>.</p>
<p>While <a href=\"http://aaronparecki.com\">Aaron</a> and <a href=\"http://ozten.com\">Austin</a> got
<a href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth/commit/1e5581b2a91b4d455be1310f833026a8c343ec71\">SMS</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth/commit/2dd7d58e26b65af53ea0a3c8659e1779dcb7be41\">Persona</a> working as IndieAuth providers during one of the Sunday hack
sessions, I wanted to explore the idea of IndieAuth (an implementation of
<a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth\">RelMeAuth</a>) as a
<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona/Implementing_a_Persona_IdP\">Persona identity provider</a>.</p>
<h3>Using IndieAuth on any Persona-enabled site</h3>
<p>The goal of this effort was to allow Indie Web developers to use their
preferred email address with Persona and have IndieAuth authenticate them
using any supported IndieAuth provider (e.g. <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/implementing-sign-twitter\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://developer.github.com/guides/basics-of-authentication/\">Github</a>).</p>
<p>This work will help bridge the gap between these two projects and allow
IndieAuth developers to log into more website using their
<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/How_to_set_up_IndieAuth_on_your_own_domain\">hard-earned credentials</a>.</p>
<h3>User setup</h3>
<p>In order to take advantage of this, users have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Serve a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona/.well-known-browserid\">support document</a> on their <em>email</em> domain declaring
<code>indieauth.com</code> as the authority for their domain.</li>
<li>Include a <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me\"><code>rel=\"me\"</code></a> link for their preferred
email address on their <em>personal</em> domain.</li>
<li>Advertise their <em>personal</em> domain on their <em>email</em> domain via
<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-webfinger\">WebFinger</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, Aaron would use the following support document at
<code>https://parecki.com/.well-known/browserid</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{
\"authority\": \"indieauth.com\"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then he would ensure that there is a <code>rel=\"me\"</code> link on <code>aaronparecki.com</code>
pointing to his preferred email address, <code>aaron@parecki.com</code>:</p>
<pre><code><a href=\"mailto:aaron@parecki.com\" rel=\"me\">Email me</a>
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, because his <em>email</em> domain (<code>parecki.com</code>) is different from his
<em>personal</em> domain (<code>aaronparecki.com</code>), they would need to be linked
together via WebFinger. Thankfully, he found a clever way to do this with
<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/aaronpk/5846789\">a simple Apache rewrite rule and some static files</a>.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Aaron and I worked out the the details of how this will work and wrote a
<a href=\"https://github.com/fmarier/indieauth-personaidp-spec\">walkthrough</a> to illustrate it.</p>
<p>The gist of it is that Persona will ask IndieAuth to certify an email
address and IndieAuth will convert that email address to a personal domain
(using WebFinger) before authenticating the user with one of the IndieAuth
providers enabled on that domain.</p>" nil nil "b669d374b755f8047f880a4bcfd21b0a") (167 (20945 14374 610820) "http://informationisart.com/19" "=?utf-8?Q?Sta=C5=9B_Ma=C5=82olepszy=3A?= Frequently asked questions about L20n" nil "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 23:47:00 +0000" "<p>I'm typing this on a train from Poznań to Warsaw, on my way back from

to attend the event and to have an opportunity to talk about <a href=\"http://l20n.org\">L20n</a> to Polish
developers.</p>
<p>Whenever I try to explain L20n to people, I first try to understand
what they already know about localization.  I found that it's useful to ask if
a developer has ever shipped a multilingual product, or if an end-user has ever
seen anything similar to the image below, where all but one word of the message
was truncated to fit the screen (there's a good chance they have).</p>
<p class=\"noindent\">
<img src=\"http://informationisart.com/images/responsive.jpg\" />
</p>
<p>Another great way to better know your audience is to listen to questions.  Good
questions are a sign that the audience was able to relate to the problem L20n
is trying to solve.  (To see why the solution is compelling, one has to first
acknowledge the problem.)</p>
<p>I was really happy with the the questions I got after my talk at meet.js.  They
were insightful and inspiring and each one brought something more to the
conversation.  Below I try to recap my answers to recurring and common themes.</p>
<h3>Only localizers know what they need</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Do you expect localizers to have programming experience?</em></p>
<p>No.  We're realistic.  We expect localizers to be experts in localization, not
programming. We're not imposing any complex syntax nor require to write macros
and dict-like data structures.  We do give localizers the freedom to get as
complex as they need, when they need it.  After all, only the localizers know
what is it that they need, and L20n doesn't make any assumptions about the
language it's used to localize into.  It's grammar-agnostic to the extreme.</p>
<p>Fortunately, more often than not there is no need to get any more complex than
the baseline.  When it comes to simple cases, L20n is pleasantly simple :</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><identifier</span> <span class=\"s\">\"A translated value\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>

<p>Localizing Mozilla projects has taught us that as many as 90-95% of messages
found in the UI are simple key-value pairs that won't require any advanced
knowledge of L20n's features.</p>
<p>For instance, the <a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/blob/master/tools/perf/example.lol\">file that we use to measure the performance</a> of real-life
usage of L20n, consists of over 500 strings, only 4 of which <em>are not key-value
pairs</em>.  The file is based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/v1.0.1/apps/settings/locales/settings.en-US.properties\">localization file</a> of Firefox OS's largest
app, Settings.</p>
<p>So why develop L20n at all?  Because it's the remaining 5% that make or break
the UI of your app.  They're too important to ignore and they are responsible
for the experience of the user.</p>
<p>L20n was created to cater to these 5%, and admittedly, L20n examples can get
rather complex (see <a href=\"http://l20n.github.io/tinker/\">L20n Tinker</a> for an example).  We're trying to show off
advanced features to explain what's possible with the framework and how it
handles common challenges of the UI design.</p>
<p>The vast majority of languages and use cases probably won't even need them.<br />
L20n's motto say it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep simple things simple.  Make complex things possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Common helpers for each language</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Will there be plural macros built into L20n for each language?</em></p>
<p>We may consider adding common rules for all languages at some point in the
future, but for the 1.0 release we decided to keep the framework lean and leave
them out.</p>
<p>Instead, we're hoping that more experienced localizers, preferably with some
programming knowledge, will step in and create common L20n files to be included
by others in their own projects.  Such files would include commonly-used
helpers like plural macros, translations of the names of the months and the
days of the week, formal and informal greetings depending on the time of day
<em>et cetera</em>.</p>
<p>Consider the following L20n file, <code>common.lol</code>:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">     <span class=\"nv\"><plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$n</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">$n</span> <span class=\"nb\">== </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"nv\">?</span> <span class=\"s\">\"zero\"</span> <span class=\"err\">:</span>
<span class=\"nv\">$n</span> <span class=\"nb\">== </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"nv\">?</span> <span class=\"s\">\"one\"</span> <span class=\"err\">:</span>
<span class=\"s\">\"many\"</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nb\">> </span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You could use the above plural macro in another file by using L20n's handy <code>import</code>
statement.</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\">import</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"ss\">'common.lol</span><span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>
<span class=\"nv\"><unread</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$unreadMessages</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">zero</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"No unread messages.  Good job!\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">one</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"You have one unread message.\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*many</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"You have {{ $unreadMessages }} unread messages.\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Thanks to this approach, the localizer keeps the control over even such basic
features of the localization as the plural selector, which allows for great
flexibility (if needed).</p>
<p>We'd love to see such common files created organically by the community and
shared among localizers in a decentralized manner.</p>
<h3>Context data and for-loops</h3>
<p>Question: <em>If the context data is global, how do I built multi-item UIs?</em></p>
<p>The interface between L20n's context and the data that developer wants to
expose to it indeed makes the data available context-wide.  In other words, if
the developer defines the context data as follows:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"json language-json\">    <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nt\">\"currentUser\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nt\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Jane\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
<span class=\"nt\">\"gender\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"feminine\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…it will be available to the localizer as <code>$currentUser</code> and can be used in any
entity.  This is an important design concept of L20n which goes back to the
idea that only the localizers can know what they need to properly localize
a message in the UI.  English may not require the user's gender to build
grammatically-correct sentences, but other languages certainly do.</p>
<p>To achieve the same in other localization frameworks, the developer would need
to pass the <code>currentUser</code> object in every call the the framework, just in case
the requested string makes use of that information in some language.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you want to build the UI out of repeating blocks and
exposing data needed by each block would lead to naming conflicts.  In such
cases, you can pass data on a per-entity basis as a second argument to
<a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/tree/1.0.0b3#ctxgetid-string-ctxdata-object\"><code>Context::get</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/tree/1.0.0b3#ctxgetentityid-string-ctxdata-object\"><code>Context::getEntity</code></a>.  Consider the following JavaScript
code:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">    <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">l10n</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'ready'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// ... </span>
<span class=\"nx\">notifications</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">forEach</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">notification</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nx\">nodes</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">].</span><span class=\"nx\">textContent</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">l10n</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">get</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'notification'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// pass notification.fromUser as $fromUser to the requested entity</span>
<span class=\"nx\">fromUser</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">notification</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">fromUser</span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// ... </span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how the developer only asks for the value of the <code>notification</code> entity
and passes <code>notification.fromUser</code> as <code>$fromUser</code>.  Here's what the
corresponding L20n code could look like:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><notification</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants to add you as a friend\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or assuming <code>$fromUser</code> has a <code>gender</code> property:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><notification</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">$fromUser.gender</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants you to add her to your friends\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants you to add him to your friends\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants you to add them to your friends\"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It's still possible, of course, to use the context-wide <code>$currentUser</code> variable
in the translation.  In the following example in Polish, the \"wants you
to add\" part needs to be accorded with the gender of the recipient, so it makes
use of both <code>$fromUser</code> passed to it directly and <code>$currentUser</code> available
context-wide.</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><notification</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">$fromUser.gender</span>, <span class=\"nv\">$currentUser.gender</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodała ją do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodał ją do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce zostać twoją znajomą\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodał go do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodał go do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce zostać twoim znajomym\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce dodać cię do znajomych\"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>See how this example can progressively get more complex?  It's interesting to
realize that the <code>unknown</code> case for both genders is, in fact, enough to get the
message across in a gramatically correct sentence.  Using more advanced featurs
of L20n, however, allows us to create a much more user-friendly interface which
seamlessly adapts to the user's gender.  As <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_and_Ray_Eames\">Charles Eames</a> famously put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The details are not the details. They make the design.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>L20n is declarative</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Can L20n automatically create declensions of unknown nouns?</em></p>
<p>It's tempting to try to create a framework that—with enough rules codified in
it—would be able to automatically decline nouns or conjugate verbs.  This has
sadly proven to be extremely difficult a task in practice which has been
keeping linguists and programmers busy for years.  Natural languages have too
many rules, too many exceptions and are not context-free.  </p>
<p>I could imagine tools built into L20n that would help create heuristics for
grammatical inflection.  For instance, we could add a method to check if a word
or an <em>n</em>-tuple starts or ends with a given string of characters.  This would
likely lead, however, to localizations becoming state machines, <em>imperatively</em>
trying to guess the correct inflection.  Unfortunately, state machines don't
model the intricacies of natural languages well.</p>
<p>L20n takes a <em>declarative</em> approach to localization, working around grammar
when needed.  Looking at examples of L20n code, it's important to remember that
they are not trying to codify the entire logic of the language's grammar, but
instead, they aim at declaring possible messages that the user might see in the
interface.</p>
<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/preso/blob/master/meetjs-poznan-2013/miasta.l20n\">one of the examples</a> I demoed during my talk at meet.js, I built a local
entity to store declensions of common city names.  The entity only defined
a nominative and a locative as these were the only cases that mattered in the
use case.  Furthermore, even though the locative case in Polish works with such
prepositions as <em>in</em>, <em>inside</em>, <em>on</em>, <em>ontop</em> and <em>about</em>, the example only
made use of <em>in</em>.  I ended up declaring my own case which I dubbed
<em>locativeIn</em>, which included the preposition.  This allowed me to easily handle
exceptions where the Polish word for <em>in</em> changes slightly to make the whole
expression sound better (<em>w Warszawie</em>—in Warsaw, but <em>we Wrocławiu</em>—in
Wrocław).</p>
<h3>Redundant by design</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Do I need to repeat the entire sentence just to change one
preposition?</em></p>
<p>The last example that I showed was a tiny website that I created during one
coffee break that counted down days and hours to my vacation.  The <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/stasm/5893026\">L20n
resource file</a> for this example is just one macro and one string, and yet
it's 34 lines long.  We designed L20n to be like this on purpose.</p>
<p>The goal was the encourage some repetition and redundancy in the syntax in
order to allow for more customization.  All for the sake of being able to
create better UI.</p>
<p>ICU's <a href=\"http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/text/MessageFormat.html\">MessageFormat</a> and its <a href=\"https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js\">JavaScript implementation</a> handle redundancy
by allowing branching locally inside of localizable strings.  While this is
technically possible (or almost possible) in L20n by using local entities,
I actually think that some redundancy can be healthy and can help improve the
readability of L20n code.</p>

<p>Dear Entrepreneur,</p>
<p>We need you. We – that is the world. Yes, you read that right. The world needs you.</p>
<p>Let me explain: Spain's youth unemployment rate is now close to 60%. Sixty percent. That is more than every second person under the age of 30 being unemployed. Italy's youth unemployment rate recently smashed through the 40% mark. The same is true for many other countries all around the globe. We have more than 7 billion people inhabiting this planet with an annual growth rate of 1.3%. That means we double the population every 50 years. A friend recently told me that we need 600 million sustainable jobs by 2020.</p>
<p>I fundamentally believe that the only way to get there is through entrepreneurship. We need people like you who are building companies, solving some of the most pressing problems in the world and create jobs doing so.</p>
<p>These are pretty scary and incredibly exciting times. While there is revolutions and uprisings looming, we will also witness the world's online population double in the next 5-10 or so years. Imagine what it will mean for the planet to have 2 billion more people with access to the web, Wikipedia and the global marketplace.</p>
<p>With that being said – we have our work cut out for us. Now is the time. Let's get cranking.</p>" nil nil "a5ccfc02f3a6eb5778d6ebee01ed4c6e") (165 (20945 14374 606222) "http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1615" "David Humphrey: Reading =?utf-8?B?4oCcV29yZHPigJ0=?=" "david.humphrey" "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 13:47:40 +0000" "<p>You’ve no doubt seen Justin Jackson’s excellent web site, <a href=\"http://justinjackson.ca/words.html\">Words</a>.  I loved it before I was half-way finished reading the whole way through.  The idea is powerful.  Words are powerful.  The web is powerful.</p>
<p>A few days later I saw Roman Schmitz riffing on the same idea with <a href=\"http://slopjong.de/words.txt\">words.txt</a>.  Roman ends with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Start with some initial words and continue with your fancy designs, responsive layouts, and scripts that do magical things.</p></blockquote>
<p>I loved this too.  There’s some excellent ideas in both pages, which I encourage you to read and ponder.</p>
<p>I want to say something about how these pages are constructed.  Earlier this year I had an interesting chat with David Ascher about what a modern web page is, and what it means to make something for the web.  We were doing planning work for Webmaker, and trying to think about what a person in 2013 needs to know and do in order to make something on the web.  David made the point that the web is no longer just HTML, CSS, and JS, but also metadata, analytics, APIs, and a host of other connective tissue beneath a skin of browser content.</p>
<p>Words and words.txt provide an interesting opportunity to explore this idea.  What is a web page in 2013, one that is intentionally stripped down, aware of itself, and trying to be nothing more than words?</p>
<p>We can’t do a pure diff of Words and words.txt, since the content isn’t identical, but if we did we see that Words is made of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>words</li>
<li>a doctype</li>
<li>a handful of HTML elements, including <code>html, head, meta, title, body, div, h1, p, strong, em, a</code></li>
<li>a few HTML entities for quotes</li>
<li>a dozen or so URLs</li>
<li>a tiny amount of CSS styling</li>
<li>a small script block with JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>What I find interesting is how Words situates itself within the web.  Because there is so little that isn’t words, it’s useful to consider what is there.</p>
<p>For one, there are links to two different social networks, Twitter and Google+.  It’s also interesting to look at that script.  This script, the so called <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/asyncTracking\">GA or Google Analytics script</a>, is so ubiquitous on the web, it’s almost not worth mentioning, and Justin doesn’t mention it.  I don’t say that because I attribute nefarious intentions to him; quite the opposite, I point it out because it’s so common now that you probably won’t visit many pages today that don’t also have it.  It’s simply become a de facto standard for making web pages.  Whether that’s good or bad is another discussion separate from the fact that it’s reality.</p>
<p>The web isn’t just HTML, CSS, and JS anymore.  The difference between Words and words.txt is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and <em>analytics</em>.  We don’t just write words on the web in 2013–we style them, lay them out, link them to other sites, and then <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115056462967470089501/posts/Ck215SzLx7Y\">watch and count people as they read them</a>.</p>

<h3>Investigating SQLite Performance via Telemetry</h3>
<p>Years ago I tweaked our SQLite clients to use a larger page size. In my testing this seemed to achieve a speedup of 0.2-2x, see <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=416330\" title=\"Suboptimal SQLite page size\">bug 416330</a>. Unfortunately, ~30% of our users are still on the old page size (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=634374\" title=\"Fix page_size of WAL databases\">bug 634374</a>). We used a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/jydoop\">jydoop</a> query to figure out if it’s worth developing a feature to convert these users over using two different (time spent <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/jydoop/blob/master/scripts/places4k.py\">reading</a> & time spent <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/jydoop/blob/master/scripts/places4k-slowsql.py\">executing</a> a query) ways to measure performance differences. According to both methods there is a 4x reduction in sqlite IO waits with the larger page size, so we’ll be adding code to convert people over more aggressively.</p>
<p>This was a cool investigation because it highlighted how much more confidence we have when making performance decisions now (due to telemetry) vs a few years ago.</p>" nil nil "b755e1c7aef30de349acf58c9d1d4e83") (160 (20945 14374 602625) "http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1610" "David Humphrey: Webmaker.org after 9 weeks, in 9 weeks" "david.humphrey" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 20:23:56 +0000" "<p>This week I spent a few days meeting with the Mozilla Foundation’s Webmaker engineering and design team in the Toronto office.  It was a great time of reflection after the <a href=\"http://www.cassiemcdaniel.com/blog/the-future-of-webmaking/\">past 9 weeks</a>, and a time to plan the next 9 weeks.  I left feeling like we’re on track, and excited about what’s next, and wanted to share some of my observations.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7321/9162209906_d5de301614.jpg\" title=\"Webmaker planning meeting at MoTo\" width=\"500\" /></p>
<p>For various reasons, our planning horizon has been, and continues to occupy a 9 week period.  Trying to forecast software projects beyond two months is fraught.  The team has really come together around a period of time that honours proper design-first development, and one that also gives engineers space to follow a rigorous process of review, iteration, and deployment (dev, staging, production).  Combining this with our ability to ship to users in short order (everyone on the team can ship, we have proper staging environments, push-button automated deploys, etc), I think the coming 9 weeks are going to be awesome in the way they let us move more quickly.</p>
<p>In order to launch the first iteration of the new <a href=\"https://webmaker.org\">webmaker.org</a>, we had to bring up 5 new apps all at once, with various dependencies between each.  This was hard to do in stages, and so we had to do a “1.0″ style release that happened all on one day.  Over the summer, this won’t be necessary, since we can now iterate on our platform, apps, and content in parallel.  Even weekly trains, as we did with Popcorn Maker in the early winter, feels too slow now, and we’ll be shipping multiple times a day going forward.</p>
<p>So what will we be shipping?  In the next 9 weeks, our goal is <strong>follow-through</strong>.  We shipped an MVP with the new webmaker.org, and we had, and have, many plans that go much further than what’s there now.  We’re ready to dive into some of these now.  At a high-level, this includes working toward shipping the following in the coming months:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webmaker Localization (l10n)</strong>:  I’ve <a href=\"http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1605\">already written about this</a>, and we remain bullish on localizing webmaker.org by the end of the summer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Ray Goggles:</strong> everyone who has ever used it loves this tool, and we do too.  <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875991\">Making it work in the new webmaker.org</a> is a high priority for us.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open MakeAPI to 3rd Party Users</strong>: we think the MakeAPI, with its idea of cataloging and making discoverable the things one makes, is useful beyond just working with our own tools.  We’ve already heard from 3rd party apps that want to use it, and we’re going to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=888285\">update it so this is possible</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on Mobile Experience:</strong> having webmaker.org work in mobile and be more responsive, is something we’re excited to do.  We’ve already started in this direction, and plan to make it better and better as the summer unfolds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Webmaker Mobile Web App:</strong> we also want to try our hand at creating a new Webmaker tool specifically for mobile, and geared to allowing users to publish to the MakeAPI more seamlessly.  This is at the early design phase, so I won’t anticipate direction by saying more.  What I can say is that we’re planning to leverage the open web platform (hi there, Firefox OS!).  I know Cassie, Kate, and others will have more to say on it soon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improve makes.org:</strong> the user publishing makes.org domain is one of our most loved features in the new site, and we have plans to take it further, adding things like user profile pages, better page and URL naming, analytics, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Media Sync</strong>: making on the web means using a variety of services, tools, and publishing platforms.  Users of the web know that one doesn’t use just a single site or work only using one account or identity.  With webmaker.org, we want to make it possible to more easily access and use the disparate bits one has created across the web.  We’d like to allow users to access their work on YouTube, Flickr, SoundCloud, etc., and use it to make and remix new work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI and UX Improvements in our Tools:</strong> we have lots of ideas to improve how our existing tools work, make them more fun and easier to use.  Some of these are small and others will take many weeks.  Watch for things to evolve.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scripts in Thimble:</strong> we’ve been working hard toward allowing our users to safely include JavaScript in their published makes for some time.  Doing this properly has meant a bunch of engineering work in our publishing code, and we’re still putting the final touches on it.  But we’re really close, and I know Pomax is currently getting the final pieces in place.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content, Content, Content:</strong> the new webmaker.org is built around content and enabling newer and better content types is something we’re already working to do.  Additionally, we have UI changes that we need to ship to make this content easier to find and remix</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tutorials:</strong> our current solution for tutorials is really a first effort at an MVP.  There’s a lot more we can do, and figuring out how to do them well is on our list.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to some of these big ticket things, there’s a host of other work that will occupy us as we go forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying down technical- and design-debt</li>
<li>Creating a Style Guide for our UI and UX</li>
<li>Creating Documentation for ourselves and users</li>
<li>Doing more User Testing</li>
<li>Figuring out how to do proper QA and User Support</li>
<li>Staying on top of Security bugs and issues</li>
</ul>
<p>And obviously we’ll continue to have fun!  This is one of my favourite teams to work with at Mozilla, and I’d encourage you to join us as we battle our way through the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?product=Webmaker&bug_status=__open__&list_id=6992455\">open bugs</a>.  We’re in the #webmaker channel on irc, and you are more than welcome to stop by and say ‘hello’.</p>" nil nil "6297baf9987d61512b6b34d0e82e1eac") (159 (20945 14374 601581) "http://blog.finette.com/2013/06/28/i-heart-failure" "Pascal Finette: I Heart Failure" "Pascal Finette" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 20:12:01 +0000" "<p>Last week I had the privilege to present a short deck on \"The importance of failure\" at a conference for entrepreneurs and startups in Germany.

blog post, but I’ll try to sum them up by saying that I reached a point where
Backbone seemed to be confusing me more than helping me, and Angular got a
<em>lot</em> of good press at <a href=\"http://fluentconf.com/fluent2013\">FluentConf</a> this
year.</p>
<p>So this morning’s task in <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/commits/feature/angular\">the re-write</a> was to
re-hook up the <a href=\"https://login.persona.org/about\">Persona</a> integration.  I had
read recently that when you had a lot of dom-manipulation functions, you should
probably put that code in a directive, and since I hadn’t written an Angular
directive yet, I figured this would be a great time to learn how.  Writing <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/blob/feature/angular/views/index.html#L30\">the
html</a>
was pretty easy, of course, and most of the code from the existing
implementation (which was largely based on the code from the <a href=\"https://github.com/jbuck/express-persona/blob/master/README.md\">express-persona
readme</a>) could
be ported over fairly quickly.  The only tricky part I ran into was figuring
out that I needed to include <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/angular-tools/blob/master/persona.js#L36\"><code>restrict: 'E'</code></a> in the
<a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive#directivedefinitionobject\">Directive Definition Object</a>.  After I
was done, I noticed that there really wasn’t that much in the code that had
anything to do with the tool I’m writing, and thus I pulled it out into a
separate repo so that other people can use it.</p>
<p>And with that, I announce <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/angular-tools/\">Angular-Tools</a>, a repo containing one or more tools
which you might find useful if you build Angular apps.  As always, pull

ads because of third party cookies, and in general about the lack
of privacy on the internets</p>
<p>I made the decision to not depend on a couple of big companies
anymore for all my data in the cloud and to pay for the services
I really needed & use the proper Firefox addons to cut down
on the ads.</p>
<p>I slowly moved away from Google.</p>
<p>I moved to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.newsblur.com/\">NewsBlur</a>
instead of Google Reader - before Reader was planned to be stopped.</p>
<p>I moved from Gmail to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://fastmail.fm\">fastmail.fm</a>. That was the
hardest one because I was on Gmail since 2004. Fastmail, it turns
out, has its servers in the U.S. too, but I guess having a
separate service for my e-mails is breaking the all-things-at-google
scheme. I am also trying to have my network use PGP when we exchange
e-mails, so they're stored encrypted on those servers I don't own.</p>
<p>Last, I moved from the Google search engine to DuckDuckGo, then
to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://startpage.com/\">StartPage</a>. The latter gives better
results than DuckDuckGo in general because it's a proxy on the
top of Google search engine. It just secures your privacy and
unlike DDG, you won't get <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/privacy\">Amazon referral links in your results</a>  I'd rather pay a yearly
rate at DDG rather than this referral system.</p>
<p>Anyways, I kept my Google account for two reasons: redirecting mails
to my fastmail account and using Google+ because I like this service
a lot. The redirection is not important anymore. After over a year of
redirection - people should know how to reach me :)</p>
<p>I also had Facebook to stay connected with my non-geek friends
mostly. I also use Twitter a lot.</p>
<p>However, the recent privacy scandals made me think a bit about
how I use all these services.</p>
<p>First of all, G+ and Facebook provide features to share <strong>privately</strong>
some data to a specific set of people. We've seen that our privacy
is not guaranteed. They'll give your data away if they're asked.</p>
<p>And well, they are commercial companies that need to sell ads,
so your private content is used anyways. Just look at the ads that
are displayed besides your e-mail when you use GMail.</p>
<p>So while there's an incentive to let you share data thinking
it's not public, shit happens. So I don't see the point of pushing
anything non-public in those silos. And it turns out that I am mostly
a consumer. Too bad G+ is a private club and you can't see its
content if you don't have a Google account.</p>
<p>If I have cool stuff to talk about, I can blog and probably
do a better job in one blog post than in numerous G+ or FB posts.</p>
<p>Twitter on the other hand, is mostly shouting out in public your
opinions, promoting your projects. I barely use the DM feature.</p>
<p>Twitter is not different of course from Google & Facebook - they
need to sell ads and your data is used for this, but at least it's
easier to control that you're only pushing public stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Given all of this, I have deleted my Google and Facebook accounts yesterday</strong></p>
<p>(well, for FB unfortunately I reactivated it today because I lost
access to my Spotify Premium account - so until this is solved, my FB
is still active but it's a matter of days.)</p>
<p>All of this if of course is the tip of the iceberg since we eventually
found out that governments can just extract content from the flow that
goes through undersea cables.</p>
<p>But what I am doing is still important. It's a political act that will
shape the future if we're a bunch of people acting like this.
We need to show through our online habits and actions that we care about
our privacy.</p>
<p>On the phone side, I guess I am in a pretty good shape since I use Firefox OS.
The only part that worries me now is the hardware.</p>
<p>Now my next task is to teach my kids how important privacy is, so that they
clearly understand what's going on when they are using the internets.</p>" nil nil "0122eaa06623e9a0a727e46c2ba305b1") (154 (20941 34153 179621) "http://blog.seanmartell.com/2013/06/27/rebuilding-a-simplified-firefox-logo/" "Sean Martell: (Re)building a simplified Firefox logo" "mart3ll" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 18:51:39 +0000" "<div class=\"top-image-1129\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-0.png\" width=\"500\" /></div>
<p>Today we are excited to announce a visual evolution of our Firefox brand that will better fit its extended usage beyond that of a desktop web browser. An overview of our brand history and the reasons for this evolution are <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/creative/?p=138\">covered on our Creative blog</a>, so this article will have a brief look at the previous version and then dive into the various visual changes we’ve made with the new design.</p>
<h3>What was new is now old</h3>
<p>The 2009-2013 Firefox logo is an amazing piece of artwork. That launch visual evolution focused on creating a refined visual element that spoke to the power and newness of the browser – a beautiful asset for a beautiful product. I use that logo every day in my work, and thanks to the Mozilla brand guide and assets repository, more and more people are using it as well. </p>
<p>Through my work and interacting with others who used it in video, print and web, it has become clear that though beautiful, the artwork does come with a few usage concerns like SVG compatibility and color consistency. We’ve listened to feedback over the years and documented these examples. Now, with the desire to reshape the look to reflect our brand evolution, this is the perfect time to step back and solve these issues.</p>

<div class=\"callout-1129\">Simplifying a style doesn’t always mean bringing it down to basic geometric shapes and solid colors.</div>
</div>
<p>Simplifying a style doesn’t always mean bringing it down to basic geometric shapes and solid colors. You can in fact bring simplicity to a visual by better balancing color, contrast, shape, and detail. To that last point, we removed quite a bit of detail in this latest revision but purposely added more detail where needed to accommodate today’s high resolution screens. The simplification process not only focused on the look but also the structure by making it SVG compatible and more accessible for the broader Mozilla community.</p>
<p>The first step in the rebuild was to go in and strip out all the detail that was using blend mode layering such as multiply, screen and overlay – mostly found in the tail area <span class=\"point-1129\">1</span>. As stated, a key goal of the redesign was to make it work flawlessly in SVG as well as open up the possibility to rebuild all the internal structure using SVG and CSS gradients. Having reduced the logo down to its shape-tweaked forms <span class=\"point-1129\">2</span> and softer gradients, we continued to remove any detail we thought wasn’t critical to the overall image. This tied into another goal of having the image hold up with greater clarity at smaller sizes.</p>
<p>Once we had removed a fair amount of detail in the logo, it was time to look at introducing enhanced detail where it would be needed when scaled to larger sizes. Stephen Horlander recreated all the continents <span class=\"point-1129\">3</span> on the globe with high resolution displays in mind and we paired those with a removal of the high gloss <span class=\"point-1129\">4</span> to create a softer, deeper color globe. Combining these deeper blues with now lighter oranges in softer detailed fur <span class=\"point-1129\">5</span>, we achieved that greater contrast that would create better separation of the elements at all sizes.</p>
<p>A final touch that you may notice in the new logo (and one that makes me very happy) is the arm of the fox now extends from a shoulder instead of layering behind his chest <span class=\"point-1129\">6</span>. It’s a small detail, but it really seems to unify the form of the fox and make him feel more cohesive a brand element.</p>
<p>So there it is. Not a logo redesign, but a simplification in form and function. We hope you are as excited about the new look as we are about using it! Enjoy!</p>" nil nil "df635a149e87a73748608269f4c0c9da") (153 (20941 30430 988008) "http://featherweightmusings.blogspot.com/2013/06/integrating-mercurial-queues-and-dropbox.html" "Nick Cameron: Integrating Mercurial queues and Dropbox" "Nick Cameron." "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 10:43:00 +0000" "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">We use Mercurial to manage the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla source tree</a>. Locally I use the Mercurial Queues (mq) extension to manage my patch queue. Mq keeps a stack of patches and provides commands (qnew, qpush, etc.) for applying, updating, and managing patches. The patches are kept in a 'patches' subdirectory in the project's .hg directory. Also in that directory are two files of meta-data - 'status' and 'series'. The former is binary data and keeps track of which patches are currently applied. The latter is text and contains an ordered list of your patches. By fiddling with the 'series' file you can manually add, remove, and re-order patches in a queue.<br /><br />I have several real and virtual machines with multiple copies of the tree on each (not always the same tree - moz-central vs inbound, for example). Keeping the patches in sync is a pain. I have to do this when testing on different platforms and when landing patches (moving from my dev tree to my clean clone of inbound). One solution is creating a user repo in the patch queue. You can then manage your queue as another repo. This is nice because you get history and can wind back mistakes, as well as backup and synchronisation. However, it is a bit cumbersome. I would prefer something more convenient for syncing between repos on the same and different machines. So, I thought what if I could use Dropbox to sync the patch queues? After all for keeping files in sync, Dropbox is as convenient as it gets. It turns out to be not that easy because Dropbox will not sync files outside of the Dropbox directory and hg will not allow you to use any directory other than '.hg/patches' for your patch queue. Furthermore you can't just use a symlink because you really don't want to synchronise the 'status' file, only the patches (and Dropbox will not exclude files). (Sometimes I want to synchronise the 'series' file, and sometimes not).<br /><br />My solution is to patch the mq extension to allow specifying the path to patches and the meta-data files (yay for open source!). I can then set up symlinks from the subdirectories to my Dropbox directory and we're good to go. The path is to patches is fairly well hard coded into the extension, I couldn't find a way to refer to a completely different directory, which would mean not needing the symlinks. The syncing between repos is not quite real-time, it only happens when I qrefresh, but that's as good as it can get, really. I have to be a bit careful to keep the repos at similar ages so that the patches cleanly apply. Which patches are actually applied is also not synced, so I have to manually track that. And even if a patch is synced, it is not automatically re-applied to the tree. I have to do a manual qpop/qpush. Still, I think this is a real improvement on my workflow. It also means it is easy for people to see what I'm working on in almost real-time, which is pretty cool.<br /><br />If you use qqueue to manage multiple patch queues, this technique should work cleanly with that. Each queue will need a subdirectory for each named path you specify. Each can be symlinked to a different directory in Dropbox or wherever.<br /><br /><b>Instructions</b><br /><br />If you want to set up something like this yourself, you will need to:<br /><br />grab the mercurial source<br />grab my patches<br />apply them<br />build mercurial<br />set up symlinks<br />configure mq<br /><br />Start by cloning the <a href=\"http://selenic.com/hg\" target=\"_blank\">hg repo</a> (I guess we could use a source bundle, but we may as well get the bleeding edge). The easiest way to apply my patches is using a queue, so qinit in the new hg directory. Download and extract the <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74741329/hg/mq_paths.tar.bz2\" target=\"_blank\">patches and series file</a> and un-tar into the hg patches directory. hg qpush -a.<br /><br />Then we need to build mercurial. On Linux this was easy, I needed to install the python-dev package and then just run 'make local' in the hg directory (I'm not going to install the new hg as the default one in case something breaks). Then pop an alias to the new hg in your .bashrc.<br /><br />Building and installing in Windows was much more of a pain, I think in part because I have a load of different versions of Mercurial installed in different places. Also I work half in real windows and half in the moz-build flavour of MinGW. Anyway, the following worked. More information <a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WindowsInstall\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/BuildingOnWindows\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br /><br />After cloning the hg repo, I installed a fresh version of MinGW (I had Python, and I guess its headers). I had to explicitly add '/c/MinGW/bin' or whatever to my PATH (export PATH... in MinGW, not the system-wide Windows version). Then I ran 'python setup.py build --force -c mingw32' from the MinGW console (this failed from the windows command prompt, even after playing with the path environment variable). I then manually copied all the .pyd files from 'hg\\build\\lib.win32-2.7\\mercurial' to 'hg\\mercurial' (where 'hg' is where I cloned hg to). Then I created an alias to the new version of hg similarly to on Linux.<br /><br />Next the symlinks. Actually, it turns out you can't use symlinks (on Linux ), because hg throws a hissy fit because \"security\". But you can use mount - 'mount -o bind $target $link' where target is inside dropbox and link is inside .hg/patches. You can put the mount in your /etc/fstab to re-mount on startup.<br /><br />On Windows use 'mklink /J $link &target'. Note the order of link and target is reversed (compared to mount on Linux) and that you will have to use '\\' not '/'. This only works in the windows command propt, not the MinGW console.<br /><br />Finally you need to configure mq. You do this by editing the hgrc file in the projects '.hg' directory (I guess you could use your ~/.hgrc file (Mercurial.ini on Windows) if you want to use the same sub-paths for all your repos, but I didn't). Add an mq section, you can then set 'seriespath', 'statuspath', 'patchespath', and 'guardspath' to add a sub-path for the various kinds of files. Any kind you don't specify a path for gets put in the usual place (.hg/patches). For example,<br /><br />[mq]<br />seriespath = shared<br />patchespath = shared<br /><br />will result in your patches and series file ending up in '.hg/patches/shared' and your status file in '.hg/patches'. (This is what I do for most of my repos, for some I don't specify seriespath so I can do different things there).<br /><br />Note: sometimes on Windows (never Linux, which is why I haven't fixed this) I see an error message when doing 'hg qnew'. But the patch gets created just fine, so it seems to be fine to ignore this.<br /><br />Finally, if you would like to see what I am working on, you can find my patches <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74741329/ncameron.org/patches.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</div>" nil nil "038a50daeb5984c18865e8a9c5e8b58b") (152 (20941 30430 986601) "http://michellethorne.cc/2013/06/making-a-difference-by-making-the-web/" "Michelle Thorne: Making a difference by making the web" "thornet" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 10:19:10 +0000" "<p>These days, with all the Prism/Tempura surveillance we’re learning about, <strong>one can feel quite powerless.</strong></p>
<p>For many it seems that there are just two responses: to either disengage with the web and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP7ebyqBn_M&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZP7ebyqBn_M\">go completely offline</a> or to shrug and say <a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/06/orwell-vs-kafka-against-nothing-to-hide/\">“I’ve got nothing to hide.”</a></p>
<p>While it’s only a very small piece of a larger effort, <strong>I’m proud to be working with people who care about a third way.</strong></p>
<h3>A Third Way: Teach the Web</h3>
<p>We believe in <strong>user empowerment that balances free expression online with a respect for user privacy.</strong></p>
<p>We want to help people take control of their digital lives—and <strong>foster a user-centric web.</strong> We can <a href=\"http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html\">rebuild the web we lost</a>.</p>
<p>To get there, we <strong>need to help people discover the joy of making things on the web.</strong> It’s important to show that the web is not a scary place. It is fun and useful to participate online while still controlling your data. This is a valuable lesson and one that should trump flashy apps or simple convenience.</p>
<p>I’d like to share some stories about <strong>people who volunteer to <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106022863174952221205\">teach the web</a>.</strong> Be it in their homes, their neighborhood shops, their city squares, or wherever, these are real stories about people who want to empower users of the web.</p>
<p><strong>It’s grassroots, it’s modest, but it’s a start.</strong></p>
<h3>Teach your family</h3>
<p><strong>Activism starts at home.</strong> You begin with the people you care about, the people closest you.</p>
<p>Like the <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Convince-Your-Parents-to-Let-You-Download-Firefox\">activists who install Firefox for their friends and families</a>, <strong>teaching the web at home doesn’t cost anything and is sustainable.</strong> You don’t have to worry about big budgets or outreach. Just help the people in your living room.</p>
<p>This is Unnati, a 14 year-old webmaker. Under the mentorship of <a href=\"http://trendsincomputer.blogspot.de/\">Gauthamraj</a>, she’s gone from learning about the web to teaching it. At home, she’s taught her mother and father how to make the web. And now this year, bolstered by her new confidence in teaching, she’s organizing a <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/events/55\">bigger event in her city</a>.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://unnati.makes.org/thimble/433\"></a></p><a href=\"https://unnati.makes.org/thimble/433\">
</a><p><a href=\"https://unnati.makes.org/thimble/433\"></a></p>
<p>And there’s Brendan, who started a <a href=\"http://neenanjones.blogspot.de/2013/05/rocket-launch.html\">maker club with his kids</a>. Together they try out fun projects each week and use the web to blog about them. The web is a platform that helps the family find new things to make and to share them with the world.</p>

<h3>Teach your neighbors</h3>
<p><strong>Sometimes to make a difference, you want to go outside your home.</strong> Teaching your neighbors is a natural next step. It’s about giving back to your community and helping people near you.</p>
<p>That’s <a href=\"http://merajimran.blogspot.in/2013/06/maker-party-shopkeeper-venus-residence.html\">what Meraj did</a>. <strong>He visited a shopkeeper on the corner, and taught them how to hack.</strong> The shopkeeper <a href=\"https://merajimran.makes.org/thimble/this-is-a-make-made-by-shopkeeper-avenu\">made a new website</a> for his store, and his whole family left <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0uK-tQv2OA&feature=youtu.be\">feeling empowered and joyful</a> about the possibilities of the web.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2313\" height=\"309\" src=\"http://michellethorne.cc/wp-content/uploads/making-in-a-shop-e1372411139640.jpg\" title=\"making in a shop\" width=\"550\" /></p>
<p>Recently, the Greek government abruptly shut down the state broadcaster, ERT, as part of its ongoing austerity drive. To help <strong>keep the news on air,</strong> Nikos, Freddy and Pierros ran workshops to teach webmaking and Open News tools to professional and citizen journalists. <strong>Set up in a public square, they <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ertops\">taught fellow Greek citizens how to be the makers of their own news.</a></strong></p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2314\" height=\"782\" src=\"http://michellethorne.cc/wp-content/uploads/ertops-e1372411424696.jpg\" title=\"ertops\" width=\"550\" /></p>
<h3>Teach the teachers</h3>
<p>Once you’ve taught your family and your neighbors, the next step is to <strong><a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/05/webmaker-train-the-trainer/\">teach other people how to teach the web.</a></strong> This means helping others develop techniques and tools that they can use to teach their family and neighbors.</p>
<p>This step is harder, but ultimately very powerful. <strong>It can increase the impact of grassroots engagement by an order of magnitude.</strong></p>
<p>Lawrence and San James organized their <strong><a href=\"http://www.newslibre.com/news/webmaker-mentor-training-kampala/\">first “train the trainer” event in Kampala, Uganda.</a></strong> They wanted to host a multi-stop webmaking tour to local schools, and in order to teach all those students, they needed more mentors.</p>
<p>Using techniques from <a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/05/webmaker-train-the-trainer/\">our training in Athens</a>, Lawrence and San James successfully mentored 40 new teachers. Lawrence noted, “It didn’t feel like a training but like a collaborative exchange of knowledge and ideas on hacking the web.”</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2317\" height=\"359\" src=\"http://michellethorne.cc/wp-content/uploads/train-the-trainers-kampala-e1372412408842.jpg\" title=\"train the trainers kampala\" width=\"540\" /></p>
<p>To scale these efforts even more, we launched an online training/collaboration called <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/\">Teach the Web</a>. With nearly 6,000 participants, and despite <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/teachtheweb-so-you-want-to-run-a-cmooc/\">all the associated challenges of coordinating and mentoring so many people</a>, it was incredibly rewarding to find so many kindred spirits who care about making the web.</p>
<p>These are stories from the participants in this course. <strong>And there are many more.</strong></p>
<h3>The Web is made by people</h3>
<p>As the first iteration of the #teachtheweb course comes to a close this week, we’re asking ourselves: <strong>what next?</strong></p>
<p>There are a several promising opportunities. Several mentors are <strong><a href=\"https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/articulos-weblitstd/\">localizing the course</a></strong> and will run the it again in different languages, including Spanish, French and hopefully others.</p>
<p>We’d also <strong>like to repeat the course,</strong> rolling in <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/teachtheweb-so-you-want-to-run-a-cmooc/\">what we learned this time around</a>. Likely, the course will be shorter (3 weeks instead of 9) and perhaps involve more tools than just webmaker ones.</p>
<p>I’d also love to see <strong>more resources on how to teach privacy.</strong> I whipped up a <a href=\"https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/lh00/\">prototype to teach encryption</a>, using material from the EFF. But there’s a lot more we can do to make these topics approachable, fun and easy to learn.</p>
<p>As we look to what else we can do, how we can promote a third way of online participation, I’m reminded of a story <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/113905697837976594807/posts\">Jeannie</a> told. She was helping a young learner make his first website. After publishing on the web, something clicked for him. <strong>He said, “Wow, so if I can make and share something on the web, does that mean that everything on the web is made by people?”</strong></p>
<p>Yes, yes it is. And we can do our part to help more people not be intimated or indifferent about the web, but <strong>instead to make things together and celebrate our shared, connected humanity.</strong></p>

It was about people who care about the web and web literacy and working together to find ways to spread skills to learners. This post is a reflection on the meta structures and processes that created the experience. <strong>It's also only <em>mildly</em> reflective of the learning that occurred.</strong> <strong>These observations completely delude the very human and personal feelings I have towards the #teachtheweb community and all the individuals within it. </strong><em>[Update: Luckily, <a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/06/making-a-difference-by-making-the-web/\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle nails the human side of this story in her post.</a>]<strong>
</strong></em>
Although this post is going to sound a bit academic, a couple of my colleagues are going to be writing about the amazing stories and community members that made <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb</a> so incredibly awesome. And I'm sure I'll have more to say about my newly expanded <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Personal learning network\">personal learning network</a> and the KICK ASS MOZILLIANS who participated in #teachtheweb.
<h3>After #teachtheweb, I'm working under two assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are lurkers in this community.</strong> Lurkers are reading, looking, observing, maybe even making things, but they're not sharing in this community, or they're not sharing often.</li>
<li><strong>Activity fluctuates.</strong> Some people have time for #teachtheweb all at once or in spurts. Others take a certain amount of time each week. Some people dip in only on certain topics, others are fairly constant throughout.</li>
</ul>
[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<img alt=\"\" class=\" \" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ShZp9A2.png\" width=\"500\" /> Well, we didn't have at least one person from EVERY country, but...[/caption]
<h3>And three absolute certainties:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our metric overview is flawed.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter much because people are definitely learning together.</li>
<li><strong>#teachtheweb is an unmitigated success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Metrics and Multiple Channels</h3>
In the #teachtheweb experience, we have multiple channels where people can participate, so we have multiple channels to collect metrics from. Unfortunately, <strong>collecting accurate metrics is next to impossible</strong> for a couple of reasons:
<ol>
<li>We didn't get Analytics onto the <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb site</a> until AFTER the first week (oops.)</li>
<li>The sign up mechanism is connected to <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">webmaker.org/teach</a>, but signing up is not required for participation because everything is open. We cannot differentiate between traffic from participants and traffic from people who never signed up.</li>
<li>People don't always tag their stuff. Sometimes there are typos (e.g. #teactheweb).</li>
<li>We encouraged self created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/zythepsary.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al0Wg7eR7tHcdDRGVEJCMEFXbmRwV3RUamhHRVlfRHc#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">Study Groups</a> (not oops, but a fail if we're talking about metrics). Study Groups may be using other hashtags and special lists. There are several untrackable study groups using private groups, communities, forums, email, etc.</li>
<li>We are sure to miscount membership. There's members vs active members vs people who are also members of the main G+.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Data Viz</h4>
Finding better ways to collect metrics and share them as data visualizations would up participation. When people feel like they're alone in their learning experience, they're much more likely to reserve their participation until others join them. People are hungry for social learning experiences, and data viz is an easy way to show learners that they're not alone.
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://infogr.am/teachtheweb-27148\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"490\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uiZjlxS.png\" width=\"500\" /></a>Here's a shoddy infographic on #teachtheweb.</p>
<h3>Community and tiers of engagement</h3>
At the beginning of #teachtheweb, we talked about three levels of engagement. These levels may eventually be associated with Mozilla Mentor Badges.
<ol>
<li><strong> Mentor-in-Making (level 1)</strong> Be explicit about the agency people have over their own learning by helping them understand there are no deadlines, responsibilities, or criteria for participation. Give them permission to work at their own speed. People aren't used to this. For someone to move from a Mentor-in-Making level to Mentor, <strong>community at higher levels need to serve as examples</strong> in the way they moderate and mentor. The progression to Mentor is extremely transient – Mentors-in-Making who are enthusiastic about their learning will undoubtedly make resources or run events that fulfill the criteria for the Mentor badge.</li>
<li>
[caption id=\"attachment_1929\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"100\"]<img alt=\"Mentor Badge\" class=\" wp-image-1929    \" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mentor-badge-150x150.png\" width=\"100\" /> Mentor Badge[/caption]
<strong>Mentor (level 2)</strong> Progression happens when Mentors-in-Making begin to mentor their peers and creating new open educational resources or run in-person events that teach openness and web skills. <strong>Celebration of participation at this level is as important as participating itself.</strong> The more interaction the typical learner receives from the community and moderators, the more they participate. Helping mentors understand their own agency in this process is very important as well. Advancing through the tiers of engagement requires people at higher engagement levels actively monitoring and mentoring in the various channels and being examples for their peers. Peer to peer learning and support is integral to sustaining the community. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/introducing_mentor_badges\" target=\"_blank\">We've launched this level</a> as the <strong>first Mozilla Webmaker Mentor Community badge</strong>. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/mentor\" target=\"_blank\">Apply for your Mentor badge!</a></li>
<li><strong> Super Mentor (level 3)</strong> Inspiring people to advance to Super Mentor status requires a personal touch and an ambient personification of open values. Again, celebration from the community as well as core staff is massively important. At the highest level, the community is looking for collaborators, mentorship and advice from the \"experts\" in the field. Finding ways to connect Super Mentors with Mentors is important for the cross over from Mentor to Super Mentor. Super Mentors are linked to sustained contribution – be it creating resources for someone else to teach with, running events or mentoring others. <strong>We'll be figuring out more succinct criteria and issuing for the Super Mentor Badge in the coming months.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Moderation + Mentoring</h4>
<strong>Be open from the get-go.</strong> Asking active community members to moderate and mentor potential community members displays trust, which leads to empowerment. <strong>A mistake to avoid</strong> is trying to select only certain community members to contribute to the planning and moderation of the online learning experience. Instead, certain community members should receive personal outreach and asks, but the community as a whole should receive an invitation to contribute.
<h3>Content Creation</h3>
<a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/planning/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Planning #teachtheweb\">Asking for \"braindumps\"</a> was a great way to get a lot of different ideas, but we may have gotten more contribution had we prepared more topic specific questions that helped people formulate their thoughts around base ideas. Keeping the it in an open form, like <a href=\"http://etherpad.mozilla.org\" target=\"_blank\">Etherpad</a>, allowed people to riff off each other's ideas, which made it easier to find patterns and threads.
However, content contributions dropped steadily throughout the nine weeks. Here's a graph:<img alt=\"contentcontributors_graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1924\" height=\"394\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contentcontributors_graph.png\" width=\"498\" />
<strong>It's draining to do active engagement while concurrently creating content.</strong> Because active conversation needs to take place if we want people to move up the tiers of engagement, preparing content and content creation mechanisms in advance is recommended. This procedure can, in and of itself, be an outreach method and works well under specific deadlines.
It might help to ask specific people to contribute to specific things based on interest and expertise. No amount of begging will help in the content creation department though, so <strong>be prepared to do the heavy lifting!</strong>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" height=\"738\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cfLzl5r.png\" />If we intend to do multiple initiatives like #teachtheweb, it would be useful to have a place where all this content can land. Wordpress might be the right technology, but our structure needs to change. Having better tools for filtering and connecting the <a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\">G+ Community</a> to the wordpress structure would be helpful. We might just need to take more time and more expertise setting up wordpress to be more user friendly for online learning.
The G+ firehose is also something to think about. <strong>There are pros and cons to using G+</strong>. For administration, there is no overview of G+, no substructuring, no archiving and it's difficult to find things (unless you know very specifically what something is called, who posted it, etc). It's a social network rather than a knowledge management system.
Additionally, despite attempts at categories, people don't tag and organize their own posts beyond the default stream. A more useful tool, in my view, would be some sort of a kick ass forum where everyone is together, could separate into groups within the structure, can tag, comment and share. <a href=\"http://discourse.org/\">Yes, I'm thinking something specific here.</a>
The facts that we've already built such a large community and that our potential community is likely already using G+ means that it would be difficult to move people from G+ to another system. However, it is something to consider.
If we intend to do multiple online learning experiences like teachtheweb, with a variety of audiences, topics and hashtags – we should think about modifying the existing system to <strong>make it easier for everyone to see what's happening in the community</strong> without having to invest the hours it would take to get an overview of this experience.
<h3>Duration & Modularity</h3>
Something that wasn't clear with the #teachtheweb online learning experience is that someone can join in any time. Advertising the experience as \"a nine week course\" was both true to form and misleading, particularly because we transitioned into <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/party\" target=\"_blank\">Maker Party</a> and aren't actually going anywhere.<strong> The only thing that's different now is that we won't send curated content every week.</strong> We're still active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> and in<a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\" target=\"_blank\"> the G+ community</a>.
Instead of having new topics each week, we might think about having monthly themes. It's lower bar than a 9 week collection of topics, but it means we'll have various groups dipping in and out of content.
<strong>#teachtheweb had a comparatively low attrition rate.</strong> In #teachtheweb approximately 18% of participants were still active in the final week.<strong> This is pretty awesome</strong>, considering that the average MOOC has less than 10% of participants in the final week*. This data is mostly speculative because I didn't really take the time to do full analysis week by week of participants and their online actions. I just compared share and tweet numbers between Week 1 and Week 8, if someone wants to do a full analysis, let me know, and I'll share the data I have :)
If we're going to run varying lengths and varying content, we should think about finding a way that this form of work can always tie together, yet stand alone. It has a lot to do with the tiers of participation, and the technology we use to post this content.
<h4>Time Boxing Pros and Cons</h4>
<div style=\"width: 53%; float: left; margin-right: 1em;\">
<strong> Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>lots of excitement and involvement right away</li>
<li>easy to set a rhythm for production, meetings, etc</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style=\"float: left; width: 44%;\">
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>people think it ends and, therefore, don't sign up if they feel they are late</li>
<li>no room for schedule shifts</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Subversive engagement + humor</h3>
Finding ways to joke and play in an online space like #teachtheweb seems really important. Experimenting with subversive +mentioning in G+, random tweeting at people and sharing relevant but goofy things from across the web helps with keeping contribution up. It might not seem like something you need to plan for, but it actually is. Finding humorous and relevant shares and/or makes can be time consuming.
<h3>Making</h3>
<a href=\"https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-make-a-kit-template/remix\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/images/assembly_thumb.png\" width=\"150\" /></a>We launched the <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">hackable templates</a> through #teachtheweb. We launched dirty prototypes, and people took them and used them in ways we'd never imagined. These templates have already become staple in Mozteach content. They continue to be an extremely successful model for Mentor content creation.
<strong>Make stuff.</strong> Give optional readings. Maybe some videos. But <strong>focus on making stuff.</strong> No discussion to be had. Inspire people to make and then be blown away by what happens.
<h3>Tell Me Stuff</h3>
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this post and am happy to answer questions. It's a long post, but could have been much longer.

<p>Today we are excited to announce a visual evolution of our Firefox brand that will better fit its extended usage beyond that of a desktop web browser. An overview of our brand history and the reasons for this evolution are <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/creative/?p=138\">covered on our Creative blog</a>, so this article will have a brief look at the previous version and then dive into the various visual changes we’ve made with the new design.</p>
<h3>What was new is now old</h3>
<p>The 2009-2013 Firefox logo is an amazing piece of artwork. That launch visual evolution focused on creating a refined visual element that spoke to the power and newness of the browser – a beautiful asset for a beautiful product. I use that logo every day in my work, and thanks to the Mozilla brand guide and assets repository, more and more people are using it as well. </p>
<p>Through my work and interacting with others who used it in video, print and web, it has become clear that though beautiful, the artwork does come with a few usage concerns like SVG compatibility and color consistency. We’ve listened to feedback over the years and documented these examples. Now, with the desire to reshape the look to reflect our brand evolution, this is the perfect time to step back and solve these issues.</p>
<div class=\"large-image-1129\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"657\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-4.png\" width=\"992\" /></div>
<h3>Make the logo simpler</h3>
<div class=\"large-side-1129\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-2.png\" width=\"300\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-3.png\" width=\"300\" />
<div class=\"callout-1129\">Simplifying a style doesn’t always mean bringing it down to basic geometric shapes and solid colors.</div>
</div>
<p>Simplifying a style doesn’t always mean bringing it down to basic geometric shapes and solid colors. You can in fact bring simplicity to a visual by better balancing color, contrast, shape, and detail. To that last point, we removed quite a bit of detail in this latest revision but purposely added more detail where needed to accommodate today’s high resolution screens. The simplification process not only focused on the look but also the structure by making it SVG compatible and more accessible for the broader Mozilla community.</p>
<p>The first step in the rebuild was to go in and strip out all the detail that was using blend mode layering such as multiply, screen and overlay – mostly found in the tail area <span class=\"point-1129\">1</span>. As stated, a key goal of the redesign was to make it work flawlessly in SVG as well as open up the possibility to rebuild all the internal structure using SVG and CSS gradients. Having reduced the logo down to its shape-tweaked forms <span class=\"point-1129\">2</span> and softer gradients, we continued to remove any detail we thought wasn’t critical to the overall image. This tied into another goal of having the image hold up with greater clarity at smaller sizes.</p>
<p>Once we had removed a fair amount of detail in the logo, it was time to look at introducing enhanced detail where it would be needed when scaled to larger sizes. Steven Horlander recreated all the continents <span class=\"point-1129\">3</span> on the globe with high resolution displays in mind and we paired those with a removal of the high gloss <span class=\"point-1129\">4</span> to create a softer, deeper color globe. Combining these deeper blues with now lighter oranges in softer detailed fur <span class=\"point-1129\">5</span>, we achieved that greater contrast that would create better separation of the elements at all sizes.</p>
<p>A final touch that you may notice in the new logo (and one that makes me very happy) is the arm of the fox now extends from a shoulder instead of layering behind his chest <span class=\"point-1129\">6</span>. It’s a small detail, but it really seems to unify the form of the fox and make him feel more cohesive a brand element.</p>
<p>So there it is. Not a logo redesign, but a simplification in form and function. We hope you are as excited about the new look as we are about using it!

The web was stagnating, it was controlled,       and users had       no choice or voice in the future of the web. Here began Firefox, a       collective       effort where individuals around the world could contribute and       build the web       that they wanted to see. Fast-forward and we now see a healthy web       where       competition in browsing options spurs advancement and growth. </div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">But the web is transforming again. The battle       is not for       what browser you chose to use at your desk, but the entire       ecosystem that       powers the computer in your pocket. Not unlike the monopoly we saw       years ago       that stifled the web, we are now watching a distinct divide being       built in       mobile. This divide isolates users and forces them to choose which       part of the       web they want to live in. Developers can no longer just build for       the web;       instead they must build for each device a user brings to the web,       undermining       the very unity that made the web successful.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">Today Mozilla fights for mobile. To liberate       users from       closed ecosystems and enable developers to build for the web in       whatever shape       it is accessed – be that from desktop or mobile devices. We are       bringing       technologies that have powered the web into the foundation of a       mobile operating       system. This is combined with a design that enables developers to       use the       technologies they know and that have powered the web to easily       build powerful       mobile apps. We see a future of the web where mobile is not       different from the       web, only a different size serving different needs of the user. In       the end, the       technologies that power the web should be harnessed to also power       the web       experienced on mobile.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">But while we focus on the battleground of today       we must also       look forward to see what is next. The future always seems distant       until it is       right upon you. Mozilla must continue to be competitive so that we       can fight       for the users and be a driving force in the open web. We must look       past the fog       of today’s concerns to prepare for how to guide and shape the web       in the next       major phase. We’ve seen the web transform from something accessed       purely by a       desktop device to a mobile web that you carry with you in your       pocket. In       mobile, the web is where wherever the user goes, provided they       have their       device. But just as mobile has grown it too will one day yield to       the next       major shift of the web. I believe that shift will be to a user       centric web.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">A user centric web does not care what device       you use to       access the web. Desktop computer, mobile phone, tablet, TV screen,       car console,       wearable device and more - the web will be synonymous with the       user and the web       will follow the user wherever they go. Users will be less       concerned about       static web sites and apps, but more about their world, the way the       web       integrates into their daily lives and activities and every device       that the user       interacts with. To prepare for the next phase of the web Mozilla       must invest in       technologies that bring the web to the user regardless of their       device. The       center of the web will be the user.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">This requires a focus on identity, cloud, and       broadening the       reach of our platform. A user must be in control of their identity       on the web       with the ability to easily and seamless represent their identity       wherever they       may be. A user may have several devices they use often, but the       web will be       expected to function equally wherever they may be. To achieve this       Mozilla must       invest in cloud and creating a representation of a user, their       profile, their       identity and desires that is not tied to a particular device, but       rather to the       user directly. We also must continue to expand the platform to       other closed       ecosystems. Many companies will want to harness the web to attract       users, but a       closed ecosystem is an ecosystem that does not empower users and       rarely       represents the user’s desires and voice.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">The future is murky and can easily pivot at any       moment. The       choices of today’s technologies, many of which are heavily       debated, can greatly       influence what comes next. But if Mozilla is truly a leader of the       open web       then we must look past the obstacles of today and envision what       will come tomorrow.       Instead of waiting to liberate users from the next stranglehold,       let’s build       the foundation for the next phase of the open web. A web that       represents the       user, enables developers, and supports advancement in       technologies. </div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">Mozilla was built on the power of a massive       worldwide       community that fought the good fight for no other reason than it       was the right       thing to do. Let’s look forward and prepare to lead what comes       next for the       web.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>mcoates</span></div><span>    </span><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>mozillian </span></div>" nil nil "800138f4eef9ca98a68abf2fcd50ce71") (146 (20941 17502 39789) "http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/teachtheweb-so-you-want-to-run-a-cmooc/" "Laura Hilliger: #teachtheweb: so you want to run a cMOOC" "Laura Hilliger" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 13:13:11 +0000" "<p><img alt=\"contentcontributors_graph\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contentcontributors_graph-150x150.png\" width=\"150\" /></p>The <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb</a> experience was about <a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\" target=\"_blank\">gathering people</a> together to learn and share and collaborate. It was about people who care about the web and web literacy and working together to find ways to spread skills to learners. This post is a reflection on the meta structures and processes that created the experience. <strong>It's also only <em>mildly</em> reflective of the learning that occurred.</strong> <strong>These observations completely delude the very human and personal feelings I have towards the #teachtheweb community and all the individuals within it.
</strong>
Although this post is going to sound a bit academic, a couple of my colleagues are going to be writing about the amazing stories and community members that made <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb</a> so incredibly awesome. And I'm sure I'll have more to say about my newly expanded <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Personal learning network\">personal learning network</a> and the KICK ASS MOZILLIANS who participated in #teachtheweb.
<h3>After #teachtheweb, I'm working under two assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are lurkers in this community.</strong> Lurkers are reading, looking, observing, maybe even making things, but they're not sharing in this community, or they're not sharing often.</li>
<li><strong>Activity fluctuates.</strong> Some people have time for #teachtheweb all at once or in spurts. Others take a certain amount of time each week. Some people dip in only on certain topics, others are fairly constant throughout.</li>
</ul>
[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<img alt=\"\" class=\" \" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ShZp9A2.png\" width=\"500\" /> Well, we didn't have at least one person from EVERY country, but...[/caption]
<h3>And three absolute certainties:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our metric overview is flawed.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter much because people are definitely learning together.</li>
<li><strong>#teachtheweb is an unmitigated success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Metrics and Multiple Channels</h3>
In the #teachtheweb experience, we have multiple channels where people can participate, so we have multiple channels to collect metrics from. Unfortunately, <strong>collecting accurate metrics is next to impossible</strong> for a couple of reasons:
<ol>
<li>We didn't get Analytics onto the <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb site</a> until AFTER the first week (oops.)</li>
<li>The sign up mechanism is connected to <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">webmaker.org/teach</a>, but signing up is not required for participation because everything is open. We cannot differentiate between traffic from participants and traffic from people who never signed up.</li>
<li>People don't always tag their stuff. Sometimes there are typos (e.g. #teactheweb).</li>
<li>We encouraged self created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/zythepsary.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al0Wg7eR7tHcdDRGVEJCMEFXbmRwV3RUamhHRVlfRHc#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">Study Groups</a> (not oops, but a fail if we're talking about metrics). Study Groups may be using other hashtags and special lists. There are several untrackable study groups using private groups, communities, forums, email, etc.</li>
<li>We are sure to miscount membership. There's members vs active members vs people who are also members of the main G+.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Data Viz</h4>
Finding better ways to collect metrics and share them as data visualizations would up participation. When people feel like they're alone in their learning experience, they're much more likely to reserve their participation until others join them. People are hungry for social learning experiences, and data viz is an easy way to show learners that they're not alone.
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://infogr.am/teachtheweb-27148\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"490\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uiZjlxS.png\" width=\"500\" /></a>Here's a shoddy infographic on #teachtheweb.</p>
<h3>Community and tiers of engagement</h3>
At the beginning of #teachtheweb, we talked about three levels of engagement. These levels may eventually be associated with Mozilla Mentor Badges.
<ol>
<li><strong> Mentor-in-Making (level 1)</strong> Be explicit about the agency people have over their own learning by helping them understand there are no deadlines, responsibilities, or criteria for participation. Give them permission to work at their own speed. People aren't used to this. For someone to move from a Mentor-in-Making level to Mentor, <strong>community at higher levels need to serve as examples</strong> in the way they moderate and mentor. The progression to Mentor is extremely transient – Mentors-in-Making who are enthusiastic about their learning will undoubtedly make resources or run events that fulfill the criteria for the Mentor badge.</li>
<li>
[caption id=\"attachment_1929\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"100\"]<img alt=\"Mentor Badge\" class=\" wp-image-1929    \" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mentor-badge-150x150.png\" width=\"100\" /> Mentor Badge[/caption]
<strong>Mentor (level 2)</strong> Progression happens when Mentors-in-Making begin to mentor their peers and creating new open educational resources or run in-person events that teach openness and web skills. <strong>Celebration of participation at this level is as important as participating itself.</strong> The more interaction the typical learner receives from the community and moderators, the more they participate. Helping mentors understand their own agency in this process is very important as well. Advancing through the tiers of engagement requires people at higher engagement levels actively monitoring and mentoring in the various channels and being examples for their peers. Peer to peer learning and support is integral to sustaining the community. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/introducing_mentor_badges\" target=\"_blank\">We've launched this level</a> as the <strong>first Mozilla Webmaker Mentor Community badge</strong>. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/mentor\" target=\"_blank\">Apply for your Mentor badge!</a></li>
<li><strong> Super Mentor (level 3)</strong> Inspiring people to advance to Super Mentor status requires a personal touch and an ambient personification of open values. Again, celebration from the community as well as core staff is massively important. At the highest level, the community is looking for collaborators, mentorship and advice from the \"experts\" in the field. Finding ways to connect Super Mentors with Mentors is important for the cross over from Mentor to Super Mentor. Super Mentors are linked to sustained contribution – be it creating resources for someone else to teach with, running events or mentoring others. <strong>We'll be figuring out more succinct criteria and issuing for the Super Mentor Badge in the coming months.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Moderation + Mentoring</h4>
<strong>Be open from the get-go.</strong> Asking active community members to moderate and mentor potential community members displays trust, which leads to empowerment. <strong>A mistake to avoid</strong> is trying to select only certain community members to contribute to the planning and moderation of the online learning experience. Instead, certain community members should receive personal outreach and asks, but the community as a whole should receive an invitation to contribute.
<h3>Content Creation</h3>
<a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/planning/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Planning #teachtheweb\">Asking for \"braindumps\"</a> was a great way to get a lot of different ideas, but we may have gotten more contribution had we prepared more topic specific questions that helped people formulate their thoughts around base ideas. Keeping the it in an open form, like <a href=\"http://etherpad.mozilla.org\" target=\"_blank\">Etherpad</a>, allowed people to riff off each other's ideas, which made it easier to find patterns and threads.
However, content contributions dropped steadily throughout the nine weeks. Here's a graph:<img alt=\"contentcontributors_graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1924\" height=\"394\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contentcontributors_graph.png\" width=\"498\" />
<strong>It's draining to do active engagement while concurrently creating content.</strong> Because active conversation needs to take place if we want people to move up the tiers of engagement, preparing content and content creation mechanisms in advance is recommended. This procedure can, in and of itself, be an outreach method and works well under specific deadlines.
It might help to ask specific people to contribute to specific things based on interest and expertise. No amount of begging will help in the content creation department though, so <strong>be prepared to do the heavy lifting!</strong>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" height=\"738\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cfLzl5r.png\" />If we intend to do multiple initiatives like #teachtheweb, it would be useful to have a place where all this content can land. Wordpress might be the right technology, but our structure needs to change. Having better tools for filtering and connecting the <a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\">G+ Community</a> to the wordpress structure would be helpful. We might just need to take more time and more expertise setting up wordpress to be more user friendly for online learning.
The G+ firehose is also something to think about. <strong>There are pros and cons to using G+</strong>. For administration, there is no overview of G+, no substructuring, no archiving and it's difficult to find things (unless you know very specifically what something is called, who posted it, etc). It's a social network rather than a knowledge management system.
Additionally, despite attempts at categories, people don't tag and organize their own posts beyond the default stream. A more useful tool, in my view, would be some sort of a kick ass forum where everyone is together, could separate into groups within the structure, can tag, comment and share. <a href=\"http://discourse.org/\">Yes, I'm thinking something specific here.</a>
The facts that we've already built such a large community and that our potential community is likely already using G+ means that it would be difficult to move people from G+ to another system. However, it is something to consider.
If we intend to do multiple online learning experiences like teachtheweb, with a variety of audiences, topics and hashtags – we should think about modifying the existing system to <strong>make it easier for everyone to see what's happening in the community</strong> without having to invest the hours it would take to get an overview of this experience.
<h3>Duration & Modularity</h3>
Something that wasn't clear with the #teachtheweb online learning experience is that someone can join in any time. Advertising the experience as \"a nine week course\" was both true to form and misleading, particularly because we transitioned into <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/party\" target=\"_blank\">Maker Party</a> and aren't actually going anywhere.<strong> The only thing that's different now is that we won't send curated content every week.</strong> We're still active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> and in<a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\" target=\"_blank\"> the G+ community</a>.
Instead of having new topics each week, we might think about having monthly themes. It's lower bar than a 9 week collection of topics, but it means we'll have various groups dipping in and out of content.
<strong>#teachtheweb had a comparatively low attrition rate.</strong> In #teachtheweb approximately 18% of participants were still active in the final week.<strong> This is pretty awesome</strong>, considering that the average MOOC has less than 10% of participants in the final week*. This data is mostly speculative because I didn't really take the time to do full analysis week by week of participants and their online actions. I just compared share and tweet numbers between Week 1 and Week 8, if someone wants to do a full analysis, let me know, and I'll share the data I have :)
If we're going to run varying lengths and varying content, we should think about finding a way that this form of work can always tie together, yet stand alone. It has a lot to do with the tiers of participation, and the technology we use to post this content.
<h4>Time Boxing Pros and Cons</h4>
<div style=\"width: 53%; float: left; margin-right: 1em;\"><strong> Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>lots of excitement and involvement right away</li>
<li>easy to set a rhythm for production, meetings, etc</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style=\"float: left; width: 44%;\"><strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>people think it ends and, therefore, don't sign up if they feel they are late</li>
<li>no room for schedule shifts</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Subversive engagement + humor</h3>
Finding ways to joke and play in an online space like #teachtheweb seems really important. Experimenting with subversive +mentioning in G+, random tweeting at people and sharing relevant but goofy things from across the web helps with keeping contribution up. It might not seem like something you need to plan for, but it actually is. Finding humorous and relevant shares and/or makes can be time consuming.
<h3>Making</h3>
<a href=\"https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-make-a-kit-template/remix\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/images/assembly_thumb.png\" width=\"150\" /></a>We launched the <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">hackable templates</a> through #teachtheweb. We launched dirty prototypes, and people took them and used them in ways we'd never imagined. These templates have already become staple in Mozteach content. They continue to be an extremely successful model for Mentor content creation.
<strong>Make stuff.</strong> Give optional readings. Maybe some videos. But <strong>focus on making stuff.</strong> No discussion to be had. Inspire people to make and then be blown away by what happens.
<h3>Tell Me Stuff</h3>
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this post and am happy to answer questions. It's a long post, but could have been much longer.

I’ve been paying special attention to the time required to reach the “first paint” startup milestone: the point in time when the first Firefox window becomes visible.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The analysis has mostly consisted of profiling the latest Firefox Nightlies using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Performance/Profiling_with_Xperf\">XPerf</a> on a reference dual-core Windows 7 laptop with a magnetic HDD. I’ve been working on several bugs arising from the investigation (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881575\">bug 881575</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881578\">bug 881578</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=827976\">bug 827976</a>,  <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=879957\">bug 879957</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=873640\">bug 873640</a>) and I have many more coming. This is an overview of a few challenges I’ve run into over the last month.</p>
<h3>Making Startup Times Reproducible</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wanted to evaluate the impact of my experimental code changes by comparing startups, but I quickly discovered that there is a tremendous amount of variation in startup times in my test environment. I then turned off <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefetcher\">Windows Prefetching</a> & <a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/windows-vista-superfetch-and-readyboostanalyzed,1532-2.html\">Windows SuperFetch</a>, two performance features responsible for pre-fetching files from disk based on the user’s usage patterns, but I still recorded excessive variation in start times.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I then turned off a plethora of 3rd-party and Windows services that were running in the background and accessing the disk: Windows Update & Indexing Service, OEM “boot optimizer” software, Flash & Chrome automatic updaters, graphics card configuration & monitoring software bundled with drivers, etc. After rebooting the laptop several times and disabling any remaining programs causing disk activity, I was finally able to achieve reproducible startup times. I expected that cold starts would be dominated by disk I/O, but I was suprised by just how heavily I/O operations dominated startup time in a vanilla Firefox install.</p>
<h3>Startup time has improved almost 30% over the last year</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In an attempt to reproduce the startup regression reported in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=818257\">bug 818257</a>, I compared time to first paint for Firefox 13.0.1 and Firefox 21.0 using my test setup. To my surprise, I found Firefox 21.0 (current release channel) requires roughly 4.6 seconds to reach first paint during cold starts, while Firefox 13.0.1 (release channel from a year ago) required ~6.4 seconds! This is almost a 30% reduction in startup time.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aq4ElA0owpEbdDhMNjh0V3pDT09Hck82UnZRaWJRTXc&single=true&gid=0&output=html\">See the raw results from 5 runs in a Google Docs spreadsheet here</a></p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was surprised by this result because I expected increases in code size and the overhead from initializing new components added over the course of a year to cause regressions in startup. On the other hand, many people have landed patches to improve startup by postponing component initialization and generally reducing the amount of work done before the first-paint milestone. I haven’t tried to identify the patches responsible yet, but from a quick look at the XPerf profiles for each version, it looks like there were gains from fixing <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=756313\">bug 756313</a>  (“Don’t load homepage before first paint”) and from changing the list of Mozilla libraries pre-loaded at startup (see <em>dependentlibs.list</em>).</p>
<h3>We are still FSYNC-ing too much at startup</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apparently, the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364439%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\">FlushFileBuffers</a> function on Windows causes the OS  to flush everything in the write-back cache as it <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ce_base/archive/2006/03/15/increasefsthroughput.aspx\">“does not know what part of the cache belongs to your file”</a>. As you can imagine, calling FlushFileBuffers is bad news for Firefox startups even it’s done off the main thread — other I/O requests will be delayed while the disk is busy writing data. Unfortunately we are currently calling this method on browser startup to write out the <em>webapps.json</em> file, the <em>sessionstore.js</em> file, and several SafeBrowsing files. The flush method isn’t being called directly, rather it’s the <em>SafeFileOutputStream</em> and <em>OS.File.writeAtomic()</em> implementations that force flushes for maximum reliability. In general, we should avoid calling methods that fsync/FlushFileBuffers unless such reliability is explicitly required, and I’ve asked <a href=\"http://dutherenverseauborddelatable.wordpress.com/\">Yoric</a> to change <em>OS.File.writeAtomic()</em> behavior to forego flushing by default.</p>
<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next steps</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’m continuing to work on reducing the number of DLL loads triggered at startup and I’ll soon be filing bugs for fixing some of the smaller sources of startup I/O.</p>" nil nil "df6e2ef283c5e19ee2d59f3da2e7761c") (144 (20941 17502 30940) "https://staktrace.com/spout/entry.php?id=800" "Kartikaya Gupta: Unraveling coordinate systems" "stak" "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 03:28:21 +0000" "<p class=\"blogEntry\">For the last few weeks I've been hacking away at a jungle of coordinate systems in the graphics code, trying to make code easier to understand and to work with. This work is technically part of the effort to make subframes asynchronously scrollable in OMTC, but it has helped us to fix other bugs as well. This post a braindump of the coordinate systems I've uncovered and the mental model I have.
<br />
<br />As of this writing, I have defined four \"pixel\" types in <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/Units.h\">layout/base/Units.h</a>. These are CSSPixel, LayoutDevicePixel, LayerPixel, and ScreenPixel. CSSPixel is the simplest - it represents a CSS pixel, which is what web content authors use to specify dimensions of things. Almost every Web API [1] deals with CSS pixels.
<br />
<br />In the days of yore, 1 CSS pixel corresponded exactly to one screen pixel. That is, when you created a div that was 50 CSS pixels wide, it would show up as 50 pixels wide on your screen. If you have a desktop monitor that is 1024 pixels wide [2] and you create a div that is 1024 CSS pixels wide, it takes up your entire monitor width. Makes sense, right?
<br />
<br />Now, let us enter the world of HiDPI display devices. On HiDPI devices, the screen pixels are so small and packed together so tightly that mapping 1 CSS pixel to 1 screen pixel doesn't make sense any more. Sure, you can fit more on the screen, but it's too tiny to be readable or useful. So we have this concept of a widget scale. The <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/xpwidgets/nsBaseWidget.cpp#l421\">nsIWidget::GetDefaultScale()</a> returns a scaling factor to account for HiDPI displays. For example, see the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/gonk/nsWindow.cpp#l557\">gonk implementation</a> which makes B2G perform a scale amount based on the actual DPI of the device. This introduces a new coordinate system that layout refers to as \"device pixels\" and what I've called LayoutDevicePixels.
<br />
<br />In the layout code, the widget scale affects two main things. One is the size of the CSS viewport [3]. If we have a widget scale of 2.0, then each CSS pixel is 2 screen pixels wide, which means that on a 1024x768 screen with a maximized browser window, you can only fit 512 CSS pixels across. So the CSS viewport width is adjusted to account for this. The other is the scale factor from app units [4] to screen pixels. Instead of the usual 60 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel you would normally get, setting a 2.0 widget scale results in 30 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel. This effectively makes each CSS pixel twice as wide when being rendered to the screen, which is the point of the whole exercise.
<br />
<br />But that's not all! There is another factor that comes into play between CSS pixels and LayoutDevicePixels, and that is the \"<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsPresContext.cpp#l1399\">full zoom</a>\". This is when, on desktop Firefox, you perform the \"Zoom In\" or \"Zoom Out\" actions. Doing a \"Zoom In\" action increases the full zoom, which works almost identically to increasing the widget scale. That is, setting a zoom of 110% is pretty much equivalent to having a widget scale of 1.1. The only difference I'm aware of is that if you specify your CSS dimensions in real-world units such as inches, then they are affected by the widget scale but not by the \"full zoom\". Tricksy!
<br />
<br />So to summarize what we have so far: in a world with just CSSPixels and LayoutDevicePixels, dimensions are specified in CSSPixels by content authors, and the browser maps them to LayoutDevicePixels based on the widget scale and full zoom. These LayoutDevicePixels are then displayed 1:1 on screen pixels as defined by the underlying platform.
<br />
<br />But what about mobile? Welcome to the land of OMTC and pinch-zoom. OMTC stands for off-main-thread compositor, and is what allows you to pinch a page on Fennec and have it instantly zoom. What's happening here is the painted page is transformed in OpenGL [5], without Gecko really knowing about what's going on. Since Gecko isn't repainting anything, this is super fast, and allows us to animate pinch-zoom at 60 frames per second (or close to it).
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, it also introduces a new coordinate system, because the LayoutDevicePixels that Gecko produced are no longer displayed 1:1 on the screen. Gecko could have painted something 10 LayoutDevicePixels wide (and so the texture uploaded to the graphics hardware would be 10 pixels wide) but then the user does a pinch-zoom and BAM! now it's taking up 20 pixels on the screen, because we told OpenGL to scale it up by 2x. So here we have our third pixel type defined: the ScreenPixel. In the preceding example the pinch-zoom produced a scale factor of 2.0 and so 10 LayoutDevicePixels would get mapped to 20 ScreenPixels.
<br />
<br />Now say you're viewing a page in Fennec and zoom in using pinch-zoom. And then you zoom in some more. And then some more. If all we did was take the LayoutDevicePixels and tell OpenGL to render them bigger by scaling it in hardware, you would end up with a very pixellated and blurry view of the page. In order to make it look good again, we have to go back to Gecko and tell it to repaint the visible area of the page at a higher density, allowing us to remove the OpenGL scaling. For example, instead of rendering a paragraph of text into a texture and scaling that up in OpenGL to display a single word really big, we can tell Gecko to just render that one word really big, and to use up the entire texture to do it. This is done by a call to <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsIPresShell.h#l1217\">nsIPresShell::SetResolution()</a>.
<br />
<br />Setting the resolution doesn't change our definition of CSSPixels or LayoutDevicePixels, but it does change something. To describe this change, we need to introduce a new coordinate system. This is the LayerPixel [6], and it sits between LayoutDevicePixel and ScreenPixel. That is, the resolution changes how many LayerPixels are produced for each LayoutDevicePixel, and now pinch-zooming affects the scale between LayerPixels and ScreenPixels. This is a little cyclical because as you perform a pinch-zoom, LayerPixels and ScreenPixels get farther apart in size. Then, once you finish the zoom, we tell Gecko to re-render the content at a new resolution such that LayerPixels and ScreenPixels are the same size once again, and we render the new LayerPixels at a 1:1 scale on the screen. When this happens the visible content goes from being blurry back to being sharp, which you can see in Fennec if you pay close attention when zooming in.
<br />
<br />So to summarize, here is what we have now:
<br />CSSPixel x widget scale x full zoom = LayoutDevicePixel
<br />LayoutDevicePixel x resolution = LayerPixel
<br />LayerPixel x OMTC transforms = ScreenPixel
<br />
<br />And so ends my braindump. Hopefully what I've written above will not change going forward, and the terms I've used can become part of the Gecko developer vocabulary, so that when dealing with code in different coordinate systems it's much easier to agree on what we mean.
<br />
<br />Notes:
<br />[1] <strike>The only exception I can think of is window.outerWidth, which is in screen pixels.</strike> (Edit 2013-06-27: I was wrong, I think outerWidth is also in CSS pixels.)
<br />[2] Note that the number of screen pixels displayed on a physical device may be modified by the operating system. For example, you can change your screen resolution from 1024x768 to 800x600, which changes the size and number of screen pixels. That's fine - we don't need to account for that in our code as the OS takes care of it.
<br />[3] The CSS viewport affects how wide the page is laid out by the layout code. One way of visualizing this is that if you have a page with just plain text, the text will be wrapped so that it doesn't exceed the CSS viewport width.
<br />[4] App units are what layout does all of its calculations in. One app unit is exactly one-sixtieth of a CSS pixel. The \"60\" was chosen because it has many integer factors and so allows representing common fractions losslessly.
<br />[5] The actual graphics system in use depends on the platform. OpenGL is just an example.
<br />[6] When Gecko paints the various elements on a page, it flattens them into \"layers\" that it hands off to the graphics stack. This is where the term LayerPixel comes from.</p>" nil nil "6b13122e4b1217987de2b13a4e1b0606") (143 (20940 21544 511623) "http://xulforge.com/blog/2013/06/android-in-4-easy-steps/" "Jorge Villalobos: Make your add-on support Android in 4 easy steps" "jorge" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 14:25:50 +0000" "<p>As you may know by now, we’re running an add-on developer contest called <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/amp-your-firefox/\"><strong>Amp Your Firefox</strong></a>. We’re very excited about it and there are various categories you can compete in, but we <em>especially</em> care about the mobile categories. We want to grow our collection of <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/android/\">add-ons for Android</a>, so that Android users can enjoy the fully customizable experience that is Firefox.</p>
<p>I have been working on making many of my add-ons Android-compatible (alas, I don’t qualify for the contest, being both an employee and a judge!). So I wanted to give you a quick primer on how easy it is to convert add-ons or create new ones that work for Android, from the perspective of someone who has already worked on desktop add-ons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Add Android compatibility to your manifest.</strong> That means supporting <code><em:id>{aa3c5121-dab2-40e2-81ca-7ea25febc110}</em:id></code> in your target applications, and adding <code><em:bootstrap>true</em:bootstrap></code> to make it restartless.</li>
<li><strong>Set up your <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions\">bootstrap.js</a> script.</strong> This replaces a good chunk of your overlay. This script is responsible for setting up and then clearing any UI elements that you want to add, and running any startup scripts. The <code>chrome.manifest</code> file is loaded normally, so any additional XUL, locale files and CSS are also loaded. Keep in mind that add-on UI on Android is pretty much limited to the content area, but you can still load XUL pages using <code>chrome</code> or <code>about</code> URLs. XPCOM and JS Modules are pretty much the same.</li>
<li><strong>Set up your bootstrap.js script, like, for real.</strong> It’s likely you want your add-on to work both for Android and desktop, so your bootstrap script should handle multiple windows well and clean up after itself. <a href=\"http://www.oxymoronical.com\">Mossop</a> wrote a <a href=\"http://www.oxymoronical.com/blog/2011/01/Playing-with-windows-in-restartless-bootstrapped-extensions\">great post with sample code</a> you can reuse to make sure you’ve covered your bases during install, uninstall, and windows opening and closing.</li>
<li><strong>Read the docs!</strong> Should this be the first step? … maybe, what do I know. You can find everything you need here: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile\">Extensions for Android</a>. You’ll especially want to get acquainted with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile/API/NativeWindow\"><code>NativeWindow</code></a> object, for Android-specific UI, and the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile/API/BrowserApp\"><code>BrowserApp</code></a> object, which is sort of the replacement of the <code>gBrowser</code> object / <code><tabbrowser></code> element.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was surprised at how easy it was to create add-ons that work on Android, and to port some of the ones I had already created. Userscript-type add-ons work very well because they generally don’t need UI outside of the content, so porting my <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/AMO-Admin-Assistant\">AMO Admin Assistant</a> add-on was pretty much trivial. More UI-heavy add-ons like <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/Remote-XUL-Manager\">Remote XUL Manager</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/CTP-Manager\">Click-to-Play Manager</a> required more thought. They both open a XUL window, which I ended up converting into an <code>about</code> page in the mobile version. I also created the <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/Mobile-Installer\">Mobile Installer</a> add-on exclusively for Android, which is more of a sample add-on I made for a talk, but uses more of the Android-specific APIs in <code>NativeWindow</code>. It’s also a nice little tool that makes it easier to install XPIs after you’ve copied them to your device.</p>
<p>All of the add-on links above point to Github, in case you’re interested in looking at their code and using some of it on your own add-ons. I hope this motivates you to give Android add-ons a try, and step up to the challenge in Amp Your Firefox. All you need is to submit your entry and have your add-on approved on AMO to win an awesome t-shirt, so I really don’t know what additional motivation is needed <img alt=\";)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://xulforge.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> .</p>
<p>If you have any questions about Android add-ons, fire away in the comments.</p>" nil nil "898346a5c910e0b5112dce9c8e9c8777") (142 (20940 18988 191787) "http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/teachtheweb-so-you-want-to-run-a-cmooc/" "Laura Hilliger: #teachtheweb: so you want to run a cMOOC" "Laura Hilliger" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 13:13:11 +0000" "<p><img alt=\"contentcontributors_graph\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contentcontributors_graph-150x150.png\" width=\"150\" /></p>The <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb</a> experience was about <a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\" target=\"_blank\">gathering people</a> together to learn and share and collaborate. It was about people who care about the web and web literacy and working together to find ways to spread skills to learners. This post is a reflection on the meta structures and processes that created the experience. <strong>These observations completely delude the very human and personal feelings I have towards the #teachtheweb community and all the individuals within it. It's also only <em>mildly</em> reflective of the learning that occurred.
</strong>
Although this post is going to sound a bit academic, a couple of my colleagues are going to be writing about the amazing stories and community members that made <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb</a> so incredibly awesome. And I'm sure I'll have more to say about my newly expanded <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Personal learning network\">personal learning network</a> and the KICK ASS MOZILLIANS who participated in #teachtheweb.
<h3>After #teachtheweb, I'm working under two assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are lurkers in this community.</strong> Lurkers are reading, looking, observing, maybe even making things, but they're not sharing in this community, or they're not sharing often.</li>
<li><strong>Activity fluctuates.</strong> Some people have time for #teachtheweb all at once or in spurts. Others take a certain amount of time each week. Some people dip in only on certain topics, others are fairly constant throughout.</li>
</ul>
[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<img alt=\"\" class=\" \" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ShZp9A2.png\" width=\"500\" /> Well, we didn't have at least one person from EVERY country, but...[/caption]
<h3>And three absolute certainties:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our metric overview is flawed.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter much because people are definitely learning together.</li>
<li><strong>#teachtheweb is an unmitigated success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Metrics and Multiple Channels</h3>
In the #teachtheweb experience, we have multiple channels where people can participate, so we have multiple channels to collect metrics from. Unfortunately, <strong>collecting accurate metrics is next to impossible</strong> for a couple of reasons:
<ol>
<li>We didn't get Analytics onto the <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb site</a> until AFTER the first week (oops.)</li>
<li>The sign up mechanism is connected to <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">webmaker.org/teach</a>, but signing up is not required for participation because everything is open. We cannot differentiate between traffic from participants and traffic from people who never signed up.</li>
<li>People don't always tag their stuff. Sometimes there are typos (e.g. #teactheweb).</li>
<li>We encouraged self created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/zythepsary.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al0Wg7eR7tHcdDRGVEJCMEFXbmRwV3RUamhHRVlfRHc#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">Study Groups</a> (not oops, but a fail if we're talking about metrics). Study Groups may be using other hashtags and special lists. There are several untrackable study groups using private groups, communities, forums, email, etc.</li>
<li>We are sure to miscount membership. There's members vs active members vs people who are also members of the main G+.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Data Viz</h4>
Finding better ways to collect metrics and share them as data visualizations would up participation. When people feel like they're alone in their learning experience, they're much more likely to reserve their participation until others join them. People are hungry for social learning experiences, and data viz is an easy way to show learners that they're not alone.
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://infogr.am/teachtheweb-27148\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"490\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uiZjlxS.png\" width=\"500\" /></a>Here's a shoddy infographic on #teachtheweb.</p>
<h3>Community and tiers of engagement</h3>
At the beginning of #teachtheweb, we talked about three levels of engagement. These levels may eventually be associated with Mozilla Mentor Badges.
<ol>
<li><strong> Mentor-in-Making (level 1)</strong> Be explicit about the agency people have over their own learning by helping them understand there are no deadlines, responsibilities, or criteria for participation. Give them permission to work at their own speed. People aren't used to this. For someone to move from a Mentor-in-Making level to Mentor, <strong>community at higher levels need to serve as examples</strong> in the way they moderate and mentor. The progression to Mentor is extremely transient – Mentors-in-Making who are enthusiastic about their learning will undoubtedly make resources or run events that fulfill the criteria for the Mentor badge.</li>
<li>
[caption id=\"attachment_1929\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"100\"]<img alt=\"Mentor Badge\" class=\" wp-image-1929    \" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mentor-badge-150x150.png\" width=\"100\" /> Mentor Badge[/caption]
<strong>Mentor (level 2)</strong> Progression happens when Mentors-in-Making begin to mentor their peers and creating new open educational resources or run in-person events that teach openness and web skills. <strong>Celebration of participation at this level is as important as participating itself.</strong> The more interaction the typical learner receives from the community and moderators, the more they participate. Helping mentors understand their own agency in this process is very important as well. Advancing through the tiers of engagement requires people at higher engagement levels actively monitoring and mentoring in the various channels and being examples for their peers. Peer to peer learning and support is integral to sustaining the community. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/introducing_mentor_badges\" target=\"_blank\">We've launched this level</a> as the <strong>first Mozilla Webmaker Mentor Community badge</strong>. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/mentor\" target=\"_blank\">Apply for your Mentor badge!</a></li>
<li><strong> Super Mentor (level 3)</strong> Inspiring people to advance to Super Mentor status requires a personal touch and an ambient personification of open values. Again, celebration from the community as well as core staff is massively important. At the highest level, the community is looking for collaborators, mentorship and advice from the \"experts\" in the field. Finding ways to connect Super Mentors with Mentors is important for the cross over from Mentor to Super Mentor. Super Mentors are linked to sustained contribution – be it creating resources for someone else to teach with, running events or mentoring others. <strong>We'll be figuring out more succinct criteria and issuing for the Super Mentor Badge in the coming months.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Moderation + Mentoring</h4>
<strong>Be open from the get-go.</strong> Asking active community members to moderate and mentor potential community members displays trust, which leads to empowerment. <strong>A mistake to avoid</strong> is trying to select only certain community members to contribute to the planning and moderation of the online learning experience. Instead, certain community members should receive personal outreach and asks, but the community as a whole should receive an invitation to contribute.
<h3>Content Creation</h3>
<a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/planning/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Planning #teachtheweb\">Asking for \"braindumps\"</a> was a great way to get a lot of different ideas, but we may have gotten more contribution had we prepared more topic specific questions that helped people formulate their thoughts around base ideas. Keeping the it in an open form, like <a href=\"http://etherpad.mozilla.org\" target=\"_blank\">Etherpad</a>, allowed people to riff off each other's ideas, which made it easier to find patterns and threads.
However, content contributions dropped steadily throughout the nine weeks. Here's a graph:<img alt=\"contentcontributors_graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1924\" height=\"394\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contentcontributors_graph.png\" width=\"498\" />
<strong>It's draining to do active engagement while concurrently creating content.</strong> Because active conversation needs to take place if we want people to move up the tiers of engagement, preparing content and content creation mechanisms in advance is recommended. This procedure can, in and of itself, be an outreach method and works well under specific deadlines.
It might help to ask specific people to contribute to specific things based on interest and expertise. No amount of begging will help in the content creation department though, so <strong>be prepared to do the heavy lifting!</strong>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" height=\"738\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cfLzl5r.png\" />If we intend to do multiple initiatives like #teachtheweb, it would be useful to have a place where all this content can land. Wordpress might be the right technology, but our structure needs to change. Having better tools for filtering and connecting the <a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\">G+ Community</a> to the wordpress structure would be helpful. We might just need to take more time and more expertise setting up wordpress to be more user friendly for online learning.
The G+ firehose is also something to think about. <strong>There are pros and cons to using G+</strong>. For administration, there is no overview of G+, no substructuring, no archiving and it's difficult to find things (unless you know very specifically what something is called, who posted it, etc). It's a social network rather than a knowledge management system.
Additionally, despite attempts at categories, people don't tag and organize their own posts beyond the default stream. A more useful tool, in my view, would be some sort of a kick ass forum where everyone is together, could separate into groups within the structure, can tag, comment and share. <a href=\"http://discourse.org/\">Yes, I'm thinking something specific here.</a>
The facts that we've already built such a large community and that our potential community is likely already using G+ means that it would be difficult to move people from G+ to another system. However, it is something to consider.
If we intend to do multiple online learning experiences like teachtheweb, with a variety of audiences, topics and hashtags – we should think about modifying the existing system to <strong>make it easier for everyone to see what's happening in the community</strong> without having to invest the hours it would take to get an overview of this experience.
<h3>Duration & Modularity</h3>
Something that wasn't clear with the #teachtheweb online learning experience is that someone can join in any time. Advertising the experience as \"a nine week course\" was both true to form and misleading, particularly because we transitioned into <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/party\" target=\"_blank\">Maker Party</a> and aren't actually going anywhere.<strong> The only thing that's different now is that we won't send curated content every week.</strong> We're still active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> and in<a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\" target=\"_blank\"> the G+ community</a>.
Instead of having new topics each week, we might think about having monthly themes. It's lower bar than a 9 week collection of topics, but it means we'll have various groups dipping in and out of content.
<strong>#teachtheweb had a comparatively low attrition rate.</strong> In #teachtheweb approximately 18% of participants were still active in the final week.<strong> This is pretty awesome</strong>, considering that the average MOOC has less than 10% of participants in the final week*. This data is mostly speculative because I didn't really take the time to do full analysis week by week of participants and their online actions. I just compared share and tweet numbers between Week 1 and Week 8, if someone wants to do a full analysis, let me know, and I'll share the data I have :)
If we're going to run varying lengths and varying content, we should think about finding a way that this form of work can always tie together, yet stand alone. It has a lot to do with the tiers of participation, and the technology we use to post this content.
<h4>Time Boxing Pros and Cons</h4>
<div style=\"width: 53%; float: left; margin-right: 1em;\">
<strong> Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>lots of excitement and involvement right away</li>
<li>easy to set a rhythm for production, meetings, etc</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style=\"float: left; width: 44%;\">
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>people think it ends and, therefore, don't sign up if they feel they are late</li>
<li>no room for schedule shifts</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Subversive engagement + humor</h3>
Finding ways to joke and play in an online space like #teachtheweb seems really important. Experimenting with subversive +mentioning in G+, random tweeting at people and sharing relevant but goofy things from across the web helps with keeping contribution up. It might not seem like something you need to plan for, but it actually is. Finding humorous and relevant shares and/or makes can be time consuming.
<h3>Making</h3>
<a href=\"https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-make-a-kit-template/remix\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/images/assembly_thumb.png\" width=\"150\" /></a>We launched the <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">hackable templates</a> through #teachtheweb. We launched dirty prototypes, and people took them and used them in ways we'd never imagined. These templates have already become staple in Mozteach content. They continue to be an extremely successful model for Mentor content creation.
<strong>Make stuff.</strong> Give optional readings. Maybe some videos. But <strong>focus on making stuff.</strong> No discussion to be had. Inspire people to make and then be blown away by what happens.
<h3>Tell Me Stuff</h3>
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this post and am happy to answer questions. It's a long post, but could have been much longer.

<p>So in what is probably a rather poorly kept secret I now no longer work for the Mozilla Foundation, in fact my last day was last week but in an attempt to stay ‘offline’ for a little while after that I’m only starting to look at the blogs and that kind of stuff again now. </p>
<h3>tl;dr</h3>
<ul>
<li>with everything that they’re doing, and everything not work related that I’ll now need to be doing it felt like a good time to go</li>
<li>not sure what the future hold yet – but let me know of anything interesting you have (rossbruniges at gmail dot com)</li>
<li>mozilla is a great place to work – I’m happy to have done so and hopefully left a good legacy of websites, standards and friends!</li>
</ul>
<p><span id=\"more-313\"></span></p>
<h3>But why?!</h3>
<p>I was there over 2 years and saw us grow from a team of roughly 15 (possibly not even that) to one that’s now well over 60 – it was quite and growth and it’s now quite a team but when I look at things it was a good time for me to go. At a time when they needed me at my very best I had <a href=\"http://www.thecssdiv.co.uk/2013/05/the-bad-week/\">too many external things happening</a> to also give them what I wanted, a lot of the sites that I made last year were in the process of being re-written and a couple of projects I helped get off the ground are now coming to a close; hopefully I’ve left a good stable launch pad for their next attack on making the next generation of webmakers.</p>
<h3>So what have I left behind?</h3>
<p>A lot of websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://mozillaignite.org\">Mozilla Ignite</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://mozillaopennews.org\">Mozilla Open News</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://www.thecssdiv.co.uk/source.mozillaopennews.org\">source.mozillaopennews.org</a></li>
<li><a href=\"https://gameon.mozilla.org\">GameOn (2012)</a></li>
<li>Mozilla Festival:
<ul>
<li><a href=\"http://mozillafestival.org\">Mozilla Festival (2012)</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://2011.mozillafestival.org\">Mozilla Festival (2011)</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>including a couple that are now no longer around (<a href=\"https://drumbeat.org\">mozilla drubmeat</a>) and the ‘old’ (or better sounding version 1.0) of <a href=\"https://webmaker.org\">webmaker.org</a>. I also contributed code to <a href=\"https://mozillalabs.com/projects/\">Mozilla Labs</a>, <a href=\"https://mozilla.org\">mozilla.org</a> and even removed a <blink> from <a href=\"http://myfavoritebeer.org/\">the very first demo-site showing Mozilla Persona</a>!</p>
<div class=\"photo_frame\" style=\"width: 100%;\"><img alt=\"6937708307_e7c226facd\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-321\" height=\"375\" src=\"http://content.thecssdiv.co.uk/uploads/2013/06/6937708307_e7c226facd.jpg\" width=\"500\" />The fridges are no longer empty</div>
<p>An office that hopefully will continue to hold awesome webdev events (I’ve hosted Djugl and LWS there in recent months), hackdays and Mozilla parties; and one that I’m looking to head back to for epic events soon.</p>
<h3>So what’s next?</h3>
<p>As of right now I don’t really have any future plans – no new job lined up and I’ve not put too much thought into where I go next; after a long time of work, work work I’m going to re-charge my batteries, get writing again and play around with a few things that I’ve yet to play with and be around for some people who could do with my help right now.</p>
<p>Saying that if you’ve got a cool job going or know of one then I’ve got time to meet up and talk so let me know – rossbruniges at gmail dot com</p>
<h4>Speaking opportunities?</h4>
<p>Something that has meant that I’ve not done as much of this as I would like is that it always takes me a while to write a talk – but I now have a bit of time, so if you want to hear me talk about things, how things work at Mozilla, working remotely, getting things done or anything else let me know – rossbruniges at gmail dot com.</p>
<h3>Is Mozilla still a good place to work at?</h3>
<p><strong>YES</strong> – and they’re hiring so head over to <a href=\"http://careers.mozilla.org/#sections\">careers.mozilla.org</a> and see what is there. There are coding jobs but also account manager, project and events manager roles and if you love the web and want to work with other people who do then this is an awesome, challenging but also rewarding place to be. I you want to ask about any of the roles please feel free to get in touch and I’ll see what I can say and try and put you in touch with the right people. But the very best thing you can do is apply – that’s what I did over two years ago and it was a great ride from then on.</p>
<p>They say ‘once Mozilla, always Mozilla’ – and I’m proud to be able to be included in that collective now.</p>" nil nil "fbd6c13d91b43df4276f9e9f92693990") (139 (20940 7891 24806) "http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2013/w3c-webdriver-face-to-face-june-2013.html" "David Burns: W3C WebDriver Face To Face - June 2013" nil "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 09:19:32 +0000" "<p>A couple weeks ago was the latest face to face of the W3C Browser Automation (WebDriver) Working Group.

The purpose of the event was to generate ideas, topics and hot issues that should drive different themes and tracks at the upcoming Mozilla summit.<br /><br />The planning event was organized as an \"unconference\". There were many merits to the open nature of this approach. It surfaced important issues and gave flexibility for the day to focus on important issues on people's minds. However, I would encourage those that are leading an unconference event to set a bit of high level context. Free flowing structure is great, but a little bit of overall goal setting is also a good complimentary item.<br /><br />During the event I led two micro sessions on topics that were important to me. The first sessions was \"Building a Framework for Decision Making at Mozilla\". This micro session was merged with another related topic suggested by Jishnu titled \"The Nature of Dissent\". The micro session was well attended with a lot of great ideas. More to come on this over the coming weeks. I'm planning to work with the team to flush out the framework and present at brown bags leading up to the summit.<br /><br />The second microsession was centered around understanding the end user when designing security and privacy features. A strong point that was raised during this micro session was the idea of identifying the user types, their desires for greater security controls, and the types of trade offs they may be interested in making (if any) for these additional features. The main point was that an understanding of the target audience is required when building additional features and security & privacy features are no different here. We have more work to do on this topic, but there's a lot of valuable information that can come from this.<br /><br />The next steps after the summit assembly are to continue working with group leads to flush out the various summit tracks. Much more information to come. But based on the energy and enthusiasm at the assembly planning event I think we're going to have a fantastic Summit in just a few months.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: small;\">--<br /></span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span>mcoates</span></span><span> </span><br /><span>mozillian</span>" nil nil "7bea6d628478cf5bbaa14e9b08945976") (137 (20939 63888 226733) "http://globau.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/happy-bmo-push-day-52/" "Byron Jones: happy bmo push day!"

"selena" "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 23:29:22 +0000" "<p><em>This is a lightly edited version of an email I sent to pgsql-hackers today.</em></p>
<p>Josh Berkus asked:</p>
<p><strong>> How should reviewers get credited in the release notes?</strong></p>
<p>Without getting into how the community might decide to do this, I thought it might be helpful to share the reasons why I believe recognizing and expressing gratitude to reviewers is a helpful, useful and gratifying exercise for the Postgres community.</p>
<p>I support crediting reviewers in a more formal way than we currently do for a few different reasons.</p>
<p>First, I believe it’s worth finding a way to say “Hey, you just did something great for Postgres”, publicly, to a bunch of people who could have spent their valuable time and energy in some other way.</p>
<p>Second, reviewers get better at their work by reviewing multiple times – so I’d like to encourage people to review more than once.</p>
<p>Third, reviewers don’t always need to be expert developers, or experts at Postgres to get started, but many people who do open source work have no idea this is true. Public recognition helps make it clear that we have people who give useful reviews and are relative novices.</p>
<p>We also have several different kinds of reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>“does it compile”</li>
<li>style/typo/easily seen bug passes</li>
<li>in-depth discussion of design choices, use case, interface</li>
<li>complex testing cases</li>
<li>performance testing</li>
<li>pre-commit checks for more subtle bugs or committer preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those, except probably the very last, can be done by people who are familiar with Postgres or its configuration, but aren’t necessarily Postgres or C experts.</p>
<p>Fourth, we have very few accepted ways to recognize contributions to Postgres. Naming in Release Notes is one way this community has consistently supported as a <em>public</em> way to say “hey, you just did something great for Postgres”. The complete list of ways I’m aware of are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recognizing major, minor and emeritus contributors</li>
<li>Making someone a committer</li>
<li>Being part of the -core group</li>
<li>Naming authors by name in commit messages (but without consistent metadata, making it difficult to count well)</li>
<li>Naming authors in release notes</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s pretty much it. That’s great for the people who have already secured positions through seniority, or because they’re amazing C hackers. I don’t know if I need to lay out for everyone the value of public recognition – if you want me to I can enumerate them. But the benefits of public recognition are huge — both in a social and a financial sense.</p>
<p>Currently, the only way I know of to be recognized for work on Postgres that is <em>not</em> seniority or code-related is #1. If you’re a reviewer, there’s almost no chance you’ll be recognized in our list of contributors without some additional, very significant contribution to our community. (Please let me know if I’m mistaken about this — I only know what I know!) Adding names to Release Notes (or some variant of Release Notes) seems like a minor concession for work that we as a community need, value and want to encourage.</p>
<p>We are so few in terms of patch contributors – somewhere between 300-400 people contribute code to PostgreSQL each year based on the names I try to pull out of commits. I haven’t counted how many reviewers we have who do not also contribute patches separately.</p>
<p>Giving people appreciation for the review work they’re doing, for free, is a good thing for everyone. Naming more names helps describe the true scope of our community. Spreading gratitude is good for those who thank and those who receive thanks (like, proven scientifically!). And we increase the number of people who benefit directly from the work that they do here, by giving them something they can point their boss, their company and their colleagues to.</p>
<p>So, when we’re debating <em>how</em> recognition might be done, please don’t lose sight of <em>why</em> this is important in the first place.</p>" nil nil "4dc0fefccbb58fa11254c3247473436f") (135 (20939 63888 224929) "http://work.erikvold.com/pathfinder/2013/06/26/introducing-addon-pathfinder.html" "Erik Vold: The Add-on Pathfinder" "Erik Vold" "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "<p>I took all of my Jetpack modules and put them in the <a href=\"https://github.com/erikvold/addon-pathfinder\">Add-on Pathfinder</a>.</p>
<h3>Add-on Pathfinder</h3>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>I’ve created this repository for a lot of reasons, and that is always the best one. It’s not worth going through them all however, so here are the ones worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the Add-on SDK needs a place where people can contribute to experimental modules rapidly, this means everything should happen on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a>, tests are optional, and auto-repacks are not an issue. I don’t think the SDK should become this, in my eyes the SDK should be the land of stable modules, and Pathfinder would be a land of experimental or nearly stable modules.</li>
<li>I feel I do my best work in a bottom-up design approach, which is how I see Pathfinder growing, I see the SDK as being developed in the opposite manner which has merits as well, such as stability. I am just one person tho and stability is just not something that I can offer for my range of modules, so I don’t feel that is the right approach for me. Teams have much greatly ability to offer stability.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>APIs will change in the Pathfinder, modules may move around too, be forewarned!</p>
<p>When this happens I will blog about it, and I’ll probably start a wiki page about this kind of thing too so that everyone has a reference that they can check.</p>
<p>Documentation badly needs updating..</p>
<p>I’m telling you all about Pathfinder now, despite the obvious need of work because I have abondoned the old repositories, and fixed many bugs in Pathfinder already which I have no intention of back porting.</p>

The project has done a reasonable job at this so far with respect to this. We check if items are in the DOM, we check the visibility of items and we normalise text from the browser, amongst our other amazing talents!
</p><p>Our default position is we enforce the idea of emulation. \"How would a user do this action?\" is the main question we ask ourselves! So when a bug that doesn't meet that we tend not to implement it. One of these times is bug 141 - WebDriver lacks HTTP response header and status code methods. This is one of the most contentious bugs in the Selenium repository. People see Selenium as more than browser automation library, they see it as a web testing framework. Yes, Selenium RC was like this but then again Selenium RC also had ~140 methods hung off one object. We made a mistake in the past, let's try not to repeat it! Anyway, I digress,  in a web testing framework world there may be times where there are use cases where you need to find out data from the response header and status codes.
</p><p>So is this a feature we want to add to WebDriver? No. \"But David, we do!?!?!?\" I hear you cry! The use case that comes up regularly is I want to know if a server is returning a 404 or 500 when I access a page. Why is there a need to start a browser to find this out? When I asked this question on twitter, my friend and fellow committer Kevin Menard said that it could be useful to to see the page response on failure and some pages can only be accessed with a real browser. The use cases that Kevin had is you want to check that the endpoint that you originally hit might might change based on the user agent passed in or there might be a site that follows the single page idea and breaks push state and therefore most of the web semantics. I admit Kevin is right with those use cases. However its only looking at a small part of the issue and there are a lot of corner cases. The major one for me is watching XHRs. What if one of your XHR returns a 500 and you get an error? Should WebDriver show you that information as well? I am sure you can see how quickly this can escalate. If you start worrying about all requests, and you should if you are worried about the initial request to a page, then you want the browser to capture all of this information and return it in a standard format. There just happens to be a format called Http Archive (HAR).
</p><p>So does the project take the task of creating a mechanism for extracting a HAR from the browser? That could be near impossible on browsers that don't readily share network usage information. So we go from WebDriver being a browser automation framework for user emulation to browser automation framework for user emulation and networking information gathering. That might be a little obtuse but its meant to be.
</p><p>While Selenium's main use case is for test automation, is not solely designed for that. We want to be the best at browser automation. Proxies are really good at managing network information and reporting on it in standard formats. Examples are fiddler and browsermob-proxy. And you can even hook them into Selenium WebDriver! Like the following:
</p><p></p><pre class=\"brush: python\">from browsermobproxy import Server
server = Server(\"path/to/browsermob-proxy\")
server.start()
proxy = server.create_proxy()
from selenium import webdriver
profile  = webdriver.FirefoxProfile()
profile.set_proxy(proxy.selenium_proxy())
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile)
proxy.new_har(\"google\")
driver.get(\"http://www.google.co.uk\")
proxy.har # returns a HAR JSON blob
server.stop()
driver.quit()
</pre>
<p>Yes it might be a little verbose to use them but if you really want to see that type of information then you should do it properly otherwise the real errors, that you originally wanted, will go missing.
</p><p>Putting in half a solution into Selenium is just going to create scope creep and a large number of bugs because its not doing the \"right\" thing. The \"right\" thing is far too subjective for it to be done correctly.</p>" nil nil "7ee5aff8042c1e480b35cd3f55cb139c") (133 (20938 55084 353955) "http://oduinn.com/blog/2013/06/26/release-engineering-as-a-force-multiplier-at-google-techtalks/" "John O'Duinn: =?utf-8?Q?=E2=80=9CRelease?= Engineering as a Force =?utf-8?Q?Multiplier=E2=80=9D?= at Google TechTalks" "John" "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 08:31:51 +0000" "<p>I was super honored to present as part of the Google TechTalks series.

I became a de facto manager by necessity, when we established the Auckland office, and became a de jure manager a little later when the increasing size of the platform team meant we couldn't all report to the same manager. (It's hard now to remember what those days were like!) I've never been passionate about being a people manager, and I've always looked to reduce or eliminate that part of my role, but our pace of hiring always outstripped my ability to send my direct reports to other managers. Lately that's changed, partly because our hiring has slowed in the areas I touch, but also because we have more and better managers in the platform team to take up load. So, the people-management side of my role is finally shrinking. I think this is good for me and Mozilla --- I think my time and attention best serve Mozilla when used for tasks other than people-management. </p><p>This means if you're looking for someone responsible for running a Gecko platform team, it's probably not me anymore.

Those areas also have their own technical decision-makers. </p><p>My decreasing management responsibilities have been offset by increasing responsibilities for leadership in other ways. As Mozilla has grown in size and scope, and my tenure lengthens, I've been playing the \"senior figure\" role more and more. Sometimes this is nothing more than repeating what a lot of engineers know, but putting my status behind it. Sometimes it's about drawing on broad knowledge of Mozilla and the Web platform to instruct people. Sometimes it means trying to modify or review code no-one else will touch :-). This is all necessary and important, but I'm not completely comfortable in it yet. Sometimes I'm hit by imposter syndrome.

<p>Over the coming weeks I’d like to introduce some of the key concepts as well as some of the issues that need your input.</p>
<p>First, I’d like to give an overview of where the spec comes from and what it covers.</p>
<h3>Why Web Animations? A summary of happenings until now</h3>
<p>On the Web today we have <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/\">CSS Animation</a> (including <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/\">Transitions</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html\">SVG Animation</a> and they both have their problems. For example, CSS is so simple it doesn’t even support synchronization and SVG is pretty hairy when it comes to interval negotiation and syncbase timing—and it’s SVG-only. Most of all though, they’re completely separate.</p>
<p>Also, Microsoft don’t support SVG Animation. They have consistently maintained that they want to see a single model for animation on the Web (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2011/03/02-svg-irc#T22-19-34\">minutes</a>) and that that model should have an API. That’s a very reasonable position in my mind, albeit frustrating for authors who want to use SVG Animation now.</p>
<p>The story since then is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>On several occasions throughout 2011 and 2012 I proposed various alternatives (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/F2F/Auckland_2011/Animation_improvements\">#1</a> – <a href=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/pres/SVG 2 Animation.html\">presentation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/F2F/Seattle_2011/Agenda/Animations/Harmonisation\">#2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/F2F/Sydney_2012/Agenda/Animations/WebAnimations\">#3</a>) for harmonizing the two such as importing SVG features into CSS and vice versa. People mostly just nodded in agreement and nothing happened.
</li><li>In January 2012, Adobe wisely suggested I <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2012/01/13-svg-irc#T23-14-43\">go away and prepare a concrete proposal</a> so people can get a feel for what is might look like. Adobe also offered to assist where they could.
</li><li>At the end of January 2012 I invited a contact from Google to join in since he had some great ideas about state machines.
</li><li>In March 2012 folks from Adobe, Google and I (Mozilla) got together in Tokyo and hacked out a first version of the spec.
</li><li>In May 2012 we <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fx/2012AprJun/0107.html\">got approval from the CSS and SVG working groups</a> to continue this work as an official work item.
</li><li>In September 2012 we presented a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvNQNtIfXXI\">demo of the work</a> at the <a href=\"http://svgopen.org/2012/\">Graphical Web conference in Zurich</a> (<a href=\"http://www.multimedia.ethz.ch/conferences/2012/svgopen/05-1_thursday?doi=10.3930/ETHZ/AV-f8a1c756-a4de-4e64-98f5-c2c0b90bc9af&autostart=false\">video recording</a>).
</li><li>In June 2013 we <a href=\"http://logs.csswg.org/irc.w3.org/css/?date=2013-06-04\">got approval from the CSS and SVG working groups</a> to publish a FPWD.
</li><li>Today (25 June 2013) we finally <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/\">published something</a>!
</li></ul>
<h3>What’s in the box?</h3>
<p>Basically, this:</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">
<img alt=\"Intersection of features provided by CSS, SVG, and Web Animations\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/CSS-SVG-Web-Animations-500.png\" />
</div>
<p>Web Animations is essentially a common model for animation that underlies CSS and SVG. It covers the common features of both plus a few only found in one or the other.</p>
<p>It also has a few extra features not currently found in either:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#grouping-and-synchronization\">Timing groups</a></dt>
<dd>This is the primary means of synchronization.<br />
It’s quite powerful but I’ll leave the details and justification for this to a separate post.</dd>
<dt>Speed control (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#speed-control\">#1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#timed-item-speed-control\">#2</a>)</dt>
<dd>This is a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/SVG2_Requirements_Input#SMIL_time_manipulation_module\">requested feature for SVG2</a> and may be useful for achieving reversing effects such as exposed in CSS.</dd>
<dt><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#custom-effects\">Custom effects</a> (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#the-customeffect-callback-interface\">API</a>)</dt>
<dd>This allows the Web Animations timing model to be used to drive animations of HTML canvas etc. by registering a script callback.</dd>
<dt><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#dfn-iteration-start\">Iteration start</a></dt>
<dd>This is a minor but much requested feature that allows you to start an animation part-way through its interval.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>What’s <em>not</em> included?</h3>
<p>Bear in mind that Web Animations is essentially a model. It’s not a declarative syntax. That’s something left to other specs. The API <em>happens</em> to be bundled with the model simply because that makes it easy to keep the two in sync.</p>
<p>The arrangement is as follows:</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">
<img alt=\"Intersection of features provided by CSS, SVG, and Web Animations\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Animations-and-other-specs.png\" />
</div>
<p>The CSS-specific features required for CSS animations and transitions will be covered in a separate specification, possibly called “CSS Animations/Transitions level 4” which expresses its features in terms of the Web Animations model.</p>
<p>Likewise, current SVG features such as syncbase timing, or targetting attributes (not just CSS properties) will be covered by a separate specification (my next task) expressed in terms of that model. That specification may be called something like “SVG Animation” but I suspect not since quite a few people have expressed interest in allowing it to apply to HTML content too.</p>
<p>Other features that are not included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bounce/spring timing functions</strong> – we really wanted to make this possible and have a couple of simple extensions to timing functions to allow this but we haven’t yet reached agreement about which one is best so we’re leaving them both out for now.<br />
The plan is to follow up with a separate specification which provides additional timing functions anyway.<br />
(In fact, with the current working draft, you can’t even do more than one timing function over an animation currently but that will be fixed in the next draft when we introduce chained timing functions).<p></p>
</li><li><strong>Media integration</strong> – this is something a lot of people have been asking for but we decided to postpone it in the interests of progressing the spec along.<br />
The good news is this <em>used</em> to be part of the spec so we know it integrates very cleanly.<br />
For now we’ll work on it in a separate spec and if that comes along quickly enough we might merge it back in.<p></p>
</li><li><strong>State machines</strong> – this is something that is very useful when you start programming UI interactions but something we decided is not critical for the first version of the spec.<br />
Again, we’ll probably work on this as a separate spec.
</li></ul>
<h3>API?</h3>
<p>Originally I opposed the idea of adding an API because I think declarative solutions are generally preferable. However, the API is useful in a few cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>It lets you inspect the state of all animations in the document. Anyone can build developer tools that present you with a timeline of all the running CSS animations/transitions/SVG animations in the document for debugging.
</li><li>It lets you make runtime changes to declarative animations—for many apps a combination of declarative and procedural approaches is the best fit and lets you achieve effects that might not be possible using purely declarative features.
</li><li>For some problems a procedural approach is suitable and in those cases using the API is both simpler than writing the animation loop yourself and also means the browser can optimise the animation for smoother performance and less battery consumption.
</li></ul>
<h3>Implementations?</h3>
<p><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/blink-dev/web$20animations/blink-dev/jDjDMTuKegI/Uh1qz44DSBsJ\">Work has started on implementation in Blink</a> and is <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875219\">on the radar for Gecko</a>. Until then <a href=\"https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js\">a polyfill</a> is coming along in leaps and bounds and covers nearly all of the FPWD.</p>
<p>That’s it for now. I’ll follow up with posts explaining specific features and issues needing input but if you have any feedback on the spec, don’t hesitate to send it along to <a href=\"mailto:public-fx@w3.org\">public-fx@w3.org</a> with subject <q>[web-animations]</q>. Thanks!</p>" nil nil "d3e1912986047ac19e754b4291983edb") (130 (20938 41127 427905) "http://ozten.com/psto/2013/06/25/persona-incentives-for-adoption/" "Austin King: Persona Incentives for Adoption" "ozten" "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 20:32:01 +0000" "<p><a href=\"http://upon2020.com/\">Johannes Ernst</a> took the time to evaluate Persona and wrote his thoughts entitled “<a href=\"http://upon2020.com/blog/2013/05/mozilla-persona-nicely-made-but-who-has-the-incentive-to-adopt-it/\">Mozilla Persona: nicely made but who has the incentive to adopt it?</a>”</p>
<p>The following is my personal take on (a small portion of) the Persona market strategy.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Persona’s #1 selling feature is privacy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This was a guiding <b>design principle</b>, no doubt about it. It <b>absolutely</b> is not our #1 <b>selling</b> feature.</p>
<p>Our team wants to help mainstream users. Sadly, privacy (and security) aren’t their main concern.</p>
<p>Johannes makes some great points around Google’s use of OpenID, that losing information about where their users are going might be a negative in evaluating Persona.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Our team has focused on the following stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Websites – Relaying Parties (RP)
</li><li>Email providers – Identity Providers (IdP)
</li><li>Browser Vendors
</li><li>People using the web (Users)
</li></ul>
<p>For each of these, deep focus was put into the value proposition and finding the right balance in the technical details.</p>
<p>I’ve never been on such a <b>large scale Open Source project</b> that focused on <b>User Centered Design, Marketing, and Security</b>.</p>
<p>Let’s take IdPs which is Johannes’ main problem. If an IdP were to adopt Persona, they would get the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizations have the ability to control the security parameters for their domain
</li><li>Brand recognition on websites which use Persona.
</li><li>A SSO-like experience for enterprise, schools, and communities.
</li></ul>
<p>Without native IdP support, an organization that controls an SMTP routable domain name is subject to the email + password of the Persona fallback. They cannot add 2 factor auth. By running an IdP they can use Yubi-keys, RSA thumbdrives, or SMS verification… whatever.</p>
<p>Once they control the security, they would be more inclined to use Persona across their family of websites. This integration is much easier than traditional methods and lowers expenses.</p>
<p>The brand recognition comes by controlling the login screen. They get this today with OpenID and OAuth which I will call “Social Login” to simplify the argument. Social Login isn’t applicable to every RP.</p>
<p>We think that adding <a href=\"http://www.guanotronic.com/~serge/papers/chi13a.pdf\" title=\"My Profile Is My Password, Verify Me!<br /> The Privacy/Convenience Tradeoff of Facebook Connect by Serge Egelman\">Facebook Connect filters out 15% of your new users</a>. (We’d love to do a study and get reliable numbers here).</p>
<p>There is a long tail of websites which can’t use Social Login and will do authentication themselves. We think that Persona is viable for many of these websites. Thus a company can further spread their brand.</p>
<p>I agree with Johannes that Google won’t be the first large IdP. I don’t think that means Persona is irrelevant or destined to fail. Universities, email providers, and enterprise can improve their users security and smooth out login flows. Identity startups can start with a solid protocol and get Browser/Website integration for free.</p>
<h3>The IdP is Only One Stakeholder</h3>
<p>Those reasons are just some of the value propositions balanced against other factors during the design of Persona’s BrowserID protocol.</p>
<p>For RPs, there is a set. Here are a couple:</p>
<ul>
<li>No platform/vendor lockin (email based)
</li><li>Easy to implement (lower cost)
</li><li>Works across devices
</li><li>Improves security (DROP COLUMN password)
</li><li>Consistent sign in across the web
</li><li>Lower cost of authentication system (forgot your password, remove sending email for verification and forgot your password, etc)
</li></ul>
<p>Again this list is non exhaustive and I haven’t touched upon Browser Vendor or User value propositions which have been designed for.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I agree with Johannes that some businesses will avoid Persona early on. Perhaps they want a Facebook Connect sign in for extended profile information and social graph.</p>
<p>That is fine.</p>
<p>Persona can help a lot of people use the web in an easy to use and more secure manner. It doesn’t have to be everybody on day one <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://ozten.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<p>Johannes, you have a long history in this space. From meeting you, I know you care about user sovereignty (and many other important factors). Thanks for helping us find adoption problems with Persona.</p>

<hr />
<p>A few weeks ago I was told that, as a Mozilla employee, I could get a free <strong><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/\">Firefox OS</a></strong> phone. There were two caveats: it’s a developer preview, so it’s rough around the edges; and I’d have to ‘dogfood’ it – using it as my ‘daily driver’ and providing feedback to developers. I considered it for a while, flirted with the idea of an Android device, and then took the plunge last week. Since last Wednesday I’ve been using the <strong><a href=\"http://www.geeksphone.com/\">Geeksphone Keon</a></strong> as my main phone.</p>
<p><img alt=\"Firefox OS box\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36058\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ffos-box.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>Firefox OS is aimed primarily at the next billion web users, people who will experience the web for the first time through a mobile device. Instead of closed, proprietary platforms (or pseudo-open ones) the idea is that the entire ‘stack’ is open and easy to develop for. If you know HTML, CSS and JavaScript then you can create an app for a Firefox OS device. As someone who felt extremely empowered as a 16 year-old creating his first website, that’s something that certainly resonates with me.</p>
<p>Because of the aims of the Firefox OS ecosystem, the developer preview reference device (the Keon) is a pretty low-spec phone for 2013. The idea being, of course, that if an app runs smoothly on the reference device then it will run well on other devices. Although there’s some occasional lag, it’s a pretty slick experience – which makes me wonder what those quad-core beasts are doing with that extra processing power?</p>
<p>It would be disingenuous of me to pretend that the Keon does everything an iPhone or Android device does. Of course it doesn’t. I miss posting to Path, running with Nike+ and adding notes to Evernote. But to dismiss it based on current conceptions of what a mobile device should be would, I think, miss the point. It’s the first phone I’ve ever had that allows me to tick a ‘Do Not Track’ option, for example. <img alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> </p>

<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two main use cases that asm.js addresses.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">The first is bringing full native applications to the Web.  Using a tool called <a href=\"http://emscripten.org\">Emscripten</a>, C++ code can be cross-compiled to JavaScript, specifically the asm.js subset.  It integrates well with existing tool chains, as we have demonstrated by porting <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/03/27/mozilla-is-unlocking-the-power-of-the-web-as-a-platform-for-gaming/\">Unreal Engine 3 to the web in 4 days</a>.  That’s an incredible achievement considering we ported over a million lines of code.  This accomplishment provides a smooth path towards publishing existing applications on the Web, or for treating the Web as a platform alongside traditional desktop and console targets.</p>

<p>Another route is using asm.js and Emscripten to port libraries that require significant computing power.  HTML5 game developers sometimes find it hard to achieve an acceptable user experience should they seek to include performance intensive elements such as physics or pathfinding in their game.  This often leads to developers needing to optimize every bit of their game just to get something workable.  asm.js makes including these intensive elements more practical.  You can now use an asm.js compiled library, such as <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/ammo.js/examples/new/ammo.html\">Bullet</a> or <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/box2d.js/webgl_demo/box2d.html\">Box2d</a> for physics, to supercharge the 5%-10% of the code that does most of the work and write the rest by hand using traditional JavaScript.  This approach gives you the speed of near-native execution where you need it and the ease and flexibility of modern JavaScript everywhere else.  Emscripten provides the needed capabilities for creating coder friendly interfaces for asm.js libraries to make them easy to interact with.</p>

<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is not limited to games.  The performance it can bring to web applications opens up many interesting possibilities for speeding up existing web tasks, or bringing new experiences to the Web.  Efforts to port video decoders and <a href=\"http://blog.bitops.com/\">photo processing tools</a> using asm.js are also seeing performance increases from taking advantage of existing C++ code without plugins or browser-specific technology.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">There have been several attempts to provide a solution for C++ developers wishing to target the Web.  We believe asm.js is the best solution, and here are a few of our reasons why:</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">1.  It’s just JavaScript.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is compatible with existing browsers.  Emscripten cross-compiled code requires Typed Arrays, a feature that is well-supported by modern browsers today, including Internet Explorer. There is no need to wait years for the technology to spread, or take the risk that it never will.  Furthermore, asm.js is a formalization of a pattern of JavaScript that web browsers have already been optimizing for, namely compiled C/C++ as generated by Emscripten and Mandreel, and a sample of that type of code appears in a popular benchmark, Google Octane.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">2. It’s fast.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to all of the work browsers have already done to optimize JavaScript in general and compiled C++ in particular (in part due to such code appearing in Octane), it is very easy for browser vendors to optimize for it and unlock its full potential — it took a single Mozilla developer about 3 months to implement <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Javascript:SpiderMonkey:OdinMonkey\">OdinMonkey</a>, our asm.js optimization module for Firefox.  Google developers also quickly achieved large speedups on asm.js, as reported in their <a href=\"http://news.softpedia.com/news/Chrome-May-Support-Mozilla-s-Asm-js-for-Native-Speed-Web-Apps-354281.shtml\">IO keynote</a>. In just a short time it is possible to get to about half the native speed of C++.  That’s faster than Java, in the case of Box2D.  That is just the first draft – we expect to get much closer to native performance with additional development on the browser side.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">3. It dramatically reduces the cost of supporting the Web.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">For developers already working with C++, Emscripten makes the Web just another port target.  Once it’s integrated into your tool chain, the web version can be recompiled alongside your other platforms whenever any updates are needed.  We have ported full properties in very short time periods.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">4. It reduces or eliminates the need for plugins.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">Companies that turn to plugins to enable their games or applications often see a significant friction in user adoption due to security warnings.  asm.js provides an alternative path that eliminates the security messaging issue while still providing much of the performance, all within a safe execution environment.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">5. It enables reuse of existing C++ libraries.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">There is a wealth of open source C++ libraries out there waiting to come over to the Web.  This is a vast amount of coding effort whose value has now been unlocked for web developers.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is still a new technology, and we have plenty of work to do to provide its full potential to the developer community.  Mozilla is grateful to Epic and other game industry leaders that have already started to work on products using asm.js.  These early <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">examples</a> are helping to prove the value, shape the technology, and encourage other browsers to priorities optimizations for it.  The best way to help support the development of asm.js is to start using it and let us know what you think by adding comments to this post.  If you are a game developer or have a performance intensive application and choose to port it over, share your work with the world and let us know about it!</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">For an in-depth look into what asm.js is and isn’t, have a look at this <a href=\"http://mozakai.blogspot.ca/2013/06/what-asmjs-is-and-what-asmjs-isnt.html\">post</a> by Alon Zakai.

In just a short time it is possible to get to about half the native speed of C++.  That’s faster than Java, in the case of Box2D.  That is just the first draft – we expect to get much closer to native performance with additional development on the browser side.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">3. It dramatically reduces the cost of supporting the Web.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">For developers already working with C++, Emscripten makes the Web just another port target.  Once it’s integrated into your tool chain, the web version can be recompiled alongside your other platforms whenever any updates are needed.  We have ported full properties in very short time periods.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">4. It reduces or eliminates the need for plugins.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">Companies that turn to plugins to enable their games or applications often see a significant friction in user adoption due to security warnings.  asm.js provides an alternative path that eliminates the security messaging issue while still providing much of the performance, all within a safe execution environment.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">5. It enables reuse of existing C++ libraries.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">There is a wealth of open source C++ libraries out there waiting to come over to the Web.  This is a vast amount of coding effort whose value has now been unlocked for web developers.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is still a new technology, and we have plenty of work to do to provide its full potential to the developer community.  Mozilla is grateful to Epic and other game industry leaders that have already started to work on products using asm.js.  These early <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">examples</a> are helping to prove the value, shape the technology, and encourage other browsers to prioritise optimizations for it.  The best way to help support the development of asm.js is to start using it and let us know what you think by adding comments to this post.  If you are a game developer or have a performance intensive application and choose to port it over, share your work with the world and let us know about it!</p>" nil nil "8106a03645e035f645650ebdac3a6fba") (126 (20937 54146 697411) "http://fjoerfoks.blogspot.com/2013/06/unboxing-my-keon-to-play-mobile.html" "Wim Benes: Unboxing my Keon to play mobile" "Fjoerfoks" "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 15:33:26 +0000" "As a Mozilla Rep and as a Localizer I was privileged to receive a FirefoxOS phone.

This work is technically part of the effort to make subframes asynchronously scrollable in OMTC, but it has helped us to fix other bugs as well. This post a braindump of the coordinate systems I've uncovered and the mental model I have.
<br />
<br />As of this writing, I have defined four \"pixel\" types in <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/Units.h\">layout/base/Units.h</a>. These are CSSPixel, LayoutDevicePixel, LayerPixel, and ScreenPixel. CSSPixel is the simplest - it represents a CSS pixel, which is what web content authors use to specify dimensions of things. Almost every Web API [1] deals with CSS pixels.
<br />
<br />In the days of yore, 1 CSS pixel corresponded exactly to one screen pixel. That is, when you created a div that was 50 CSS pixels wide, it would show up as 50 pixels wide on your screen. If you have a desktop monitor that is 1024 pixels wide [2] and you create a div that is 1024 CSS pixels wide, it takes up your entire monitor width. Makes sense, right?
<br />
<br />Now, let us enter the world of HiDPI display devices. On HiDPI devices, the screen pixels are so small and packed together so tightly that mapping 1 CSS pixel to 1 screen pixel doesn't make sense any more. Sure, you can fit more on the screen, but it's too tiny to be readable or useful. So we have this concept of a widget scale. The <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/xpwidgets/nsBaseWidget.cpp#l421\">nsIWidget::GetDefaultScale()</a> returns a scaling factor to account for HiDPI displays. For example, see the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/gonk/nsWindow.cpp#l557\">gonk implementation</a> which makes B2G perform a scale amount based on the actual DPI of the device. This introduces a new coordinate system that layout refers to as \"device pixels\" and what I've called LayoutDevicePixels.
<br />
<br />In the layout code, the widget scale affects two main things. One is the size of the CSS viewport [3]. If we have a widget scale of 2.0, then each CSS pixel is 2 screen pixels wide, which means that on a 1024x768 screen with a maximized browser window, you can only fit 512 CSS pixels across. So the CSS viewport width is adjusted to account for this. The other is the scale factor from app units [4] to screen pixels. Instead of the usual 60 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel you would normally get, setting a 2.0 widget scale results in 30 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel. This effectively makes each CSS pixel twice as wide when being rendered to the screen, which is the point of the whole exercise.
<br />
<br />But that's not all! There is another factor that comes into play between CSS pixels and LayoutDevicePixels, and that is the \"<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsPresContext.cpp#l1399\">full zoom</a>\". This is when, on desktop Firefox, you perform the \"Zoom In\" or \"Zoom Out\" actions. Doing a \"Zoom In\" action increases the full zoom, which works almost identically to increasing the widget scale. That is, setting a zoom of 110% is pretty much equivalent to having a widget scale of 1.1. The only difference I'm aware of is that if you specify your CSS dimensions in real-world units such as inches, then they are affected by the widget scale but not by the \"full zoom\". Tricksy!
<br />
<br />So to summarize what we have so far: in a world with just CSSPixels and LayoutDevicePixels, dimensions are specified in CSSPixels by content authors, and the browser maps them to LayoutDevicePixels based on the widget scale and full zoom. These LayoutDevicePixels are then displayed 1:1 on screen pixels as defined by the underlying platform.
<br />
<br />But what about mobile? Welcome to the land of OMTC and pinch-zoom. OMTC stands for off-main-thread compositor, and is what allows you to pinch a page on Fennec and have it instantly zoom. What's happening here is the painted page is transformed in OpenGL [5], without Gecko really knowing about what's going on. Since Gecko isn't repainting anything, this is super fast, and allows us to animate pinch-zoom at 60 frames per second (or close to it).
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, it also introduces a new coordinate system, because the LayoutDevicePixels that Gecko produced are no longer displayed 1:1 on the screen. Gecko could have painted something 10 LayoutDevicePixels wide (and so the texture uploaded to the graphics hardware would be 10 pixels wide) but then the user does a pinch-zoom and BAM! now it's taking up 20 pixels on the screen, because we told OpenGL to scale it up by 2x. So here we have our third pixel type defined: the ScreenPixel. In the preceding example the pinch-zoom produced a scale factor of 2.0 and so 10 LayoutDevicePixels would get mapped to 20 ScreenPixels.
<br />
<br />Now say you're viewing a page in Fennec and zoom in using pinch-zoom. And then you zoom in some more. And then some more. If all we did was take the LayoutDevicePixels and tell OpenGL to render them bigger by scaling it in hardware, you would end up with a very pixellated and blurry view of the page. In order to make it look good again, we have to go back to Gecko and tell it to repaint the visible area of the page at a higher density, allowing us to remove the OpenGL scaling. For example, instead of rendering a paragraph of text into a texture and scaling that up in OpenGL to display a single word really big, we can tell Gecko to just render that one word really big, and to use up the entire texture to do it. This is done by a call to <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsIPresShell.h#l1217\">nsIPresShell::SetResolution()</a>.
<br />
<br />Setting the resolution doesn't change our definition of CSSPixels or LayoutDevicePixels, but it does change something. To describe this change, we need to introduce a new coordinate system. This is the LayerPixel [6], and it sits between LayoutDevicePixel and ScreenPixel. That is, the resolution changes how many LayerPixels are produced for each LayoutDevicePixel, and now pinch-zooming affects the scale between LayerPixels and ScreenPixels. This is a little cyclical because as you perform a pinch-zoom, LayerPixels and ScreenPixels get farther apart in size. Then, once you finish the zoom, we tell Gecko to re-render the content at a new resolution such that LayerPixels and ScreenPixels are the same size once again, and we render the new LayerPixels at a 1:1 scale on the screen. When this happens the visible content goes from being blurry back to being sharp, which you can see in Fennec if you pay close attention when zooming in.
<br />
<br />So to summarize, here is what we have now:
<br />CSSPixel x widget scale x full zoom = LayoutDevicePixel
<br />LayoutDevicePixel x resolution = LayerPixel
<br />LayerPixel x OMTC transforms = ScreenPixel
<br />
<br />And so ends my braindump. Hopefully what I've written above will not change going forward, and the terms I've used can become part of the Gecko developer vocabulary, so that when dealing with code in different coordinate systems it's much easier to agree on what we mean.

<br />Notes:
<br />[1] The only exception I can think of is window.outerWidth, which is in screen pixels.
<br />[2] Note that the number of screen pixels displayed on a physical device may be modified by the operating system. For example, you can change your screen resolution from 1024x768 to 800x600, which changes the size and number of screen pixels. That's fine - we don't need to account for that in our code as the OS takes care of it.
<br />[3] The CSS viewport affects how wide the page is laid out by the layout code. One way of visualizing this is that if you have a page with just plain text, the text will be wrapped so that it doesn't exceed the CSS viewport width.
<br />[4] App units are what layout does all of its calculations in. One app unit is exactly one-sixtieth of a CSS pixel. The \"60\" was chosen because it has many integer factors and so allows representing common fractions losslessly.
<br />[5] The actual graphics system in use depends on the platform. OpenGL is just an example.
<br />[6] When Gecko paints the various elements on a page, it flattens them into \"layers\" that it hands off to the graphics stack.

This work is technically part of the effort to make subframes asynchronously scrollable in OMTC, but it has helped us to fix other bugs as well. This post a braindump of the coordinate systems I've uncovered and the mental model I have.
<br />
<br />As of this writing, I have defined four \"pixel\" types in <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/Units.h\">layout/base/Units.h</a>. These are CSSPixel, LayoutDevicePixel, LayerPixel, and ScreenPixel. CSSPixel is the simplest - it represents a CSS pixel, which is what web content authors use to specify dimensions of things. Almost every Web API [1] deals with CSS pixels.
<br />
<br />In the days of yore, 1 CSS pixel corresponded exactly to one screen pixel. That is, when you created a div that was 50 CSS pixels wide, it would show up as 50 pixels wide on your screen. If you have a desktop monitor that is 1024 pixels wide [2] and you create a div that is 1024 CSS pixels wide, it takes up your entire monitor width. Makes sense, right?
<br />
<br />Now, let us enter the world of HiDPI display devices. On HiDPI devices, the screen pixels are so small and packed together so tightly that mapping 1 CSS pixel to 1 screen pixel doesn't make sense any more. Sure, you can fit more on the screen, but it's too tiny to be readable or useful. So we have this concept of a widget scale. The <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/xpwidgets/nsBaseWidget.cpp#l421\">nsIWidget::GetDefaultScale()</a> returns a scaling factor to account for HiDPI displays. For example, see the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/gonk/nsWindow.cpp#l557\">gonk implementation</a> which makes B2G perform a scale amount based on the actual DPI of the device. This introduces a new coordinate system that layout refers to as \"device pixels\" and what I've called LayoutDevicePixels.
<br />
<br />In the layout code, the widget scale affects two main things. One is the size of the CSS viewport [3]. If we have a widget scale of 2.0, then each CSS pixel is 2 screen pixels wide, which means that on a 1024x768 screen with a maximized browser window, you can only fit 512 CSS pixels across. So the CSS viewport width is adjusted to account for this. The other is the scale factor from app units [4] to screen pixels. Instead of the usual 60 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel you would normally get, setting a 2.0 widget scale results in 30 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel. This effectively makes each CSS pixel twice as wide when being rendered to the screen, which is the point of the whole exercise.
<br />
<br />But that's not all! There is another factor that comes into play between CSS pixels and LayoutDevicePixels, and that is the \"<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsPresContext.cpp#l1399\">full zoom</a>\". This is when, on desktop Firefox, you perform the \"Zoom In\" or \"Zoom Out\" actions. Doing a \"Zoom In\" action increases the full zoom, which works almost identically to increasing the widget scale. That is, setting a zoom of 110% is pretty much equivalent to having a widget scale of 1.1. The only difference I'm aware of is that if you specify your CSS dimensions in real-world units such as inches, then they are affected by the widget scale but not by the \"full zoom\". Tricksy!
<br />
<br />So to summarize what we have so far: in a world with just CSSPixels and LayoutDevicePixels, dimensions are specified in CSSPixels by content authors, and the browser maps them to LayoutDevicePixels based on the widget scale and full zoom. These LayoutDevicePixels are then displayed 1:1 on screen pixels as defined by the underlying platform.
<br />

<br />Setting the resolution doesn't change our definition of CSSPixels or LayoutDevicePixels, but it does change something. To describe this change, we need to introduce a new coordinate system.

and Chef has taken off in recent years. And rightly so - these
pieces of software make the lives of countless system
administrators much better (in theory).</p>
<p>In their default (and common) configuration, these pieces of
software do a terrific job of ensuring a machine is provisioned with
<em>today's</em> configuration. However, for many server provisioning
scenarios, we actually care about <em>yesterday's</em> configuration.</p>
<p>In this post, I will talk about the importance of time when configuring
machines.</p>
<h3>Describing the problem</h3>
<p>If you've worked on any kind of server application, chances are
you've had to deal with a rollback. Some new version of a package
or web application is rolled out to production. However, due to
unforeseen problems, it needed to be rolled back.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps you operate a farm of machines that continuously build
or compile software from version control. It's desirable to be able
to reproduce the output from a previous build (ideally bit
identical).</p>
<p>In these scenarios, the wall time plays a crucial rule when dealing
with a central, master configuration server (such as a Puppet
master).</p>
<p>Since a client will always pull the latest revision of its
configuration from the server, it's very easy to define your
configurations such that the result of machine provisioning
today is different from yesterday (or last week or last month).</p>
<p>For example, let's say you are running Puppet to manage a machine
that sits in a continuous integration farm and recompiles a source
tree over and over. In your Puppet manifest you have:</p>
<pre><code>package {
\"gcc\":
ensure => latest
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you run Puppet today, you may pull down GCC 4.7 from the remote
package repository because 4.7 is the latest version available. But
if you run Puppet tomorrow, you may pull down GCC 4.8 because the
package repository has been updated! If for some reason you need
to rebuild one of today's builds tomorrow (perhaps you want to
rebuild that revision plus a minor patch), they'll use different
compiler versions (or any package for that matter) and the output
may not be consistent - it may not even work at all! So much for
repeatability.</p>
<p>File templates are another example. In Puppet, file templates are
evaluated on the server and the results are sent to the client. So,
the output of file template execution today might be different from
the output tomorrow. If you needed to roll back your server to an
old version, you may not be able to do that because the template
on the server isn't backwards compatible! This can be worked around,
sure (commonly by copying the template and branching differences),
but over time these hacks accumulate in a giant pile of complexity.</p>
<p>The common issue here is that time has an impact on the outcome of
machine configuration. I refer to this issue as <strong>time-dependent
idempotency</strong>. In other words, does time play a role in the
supposedly idempotent configuration process? If the output is
consistent no matter <em>when</em> you run the configuration, it is
time-independent and truly idempotent. If it varies depending on
when configuration is performed, it is time-dependent and thus
not truly idempotent.</p>
<h3>Solving the problem</h3>
<p>My attitude towards machine configuration and automation is that
it should be as time independent as possible. If I need to revert
to yesterday's state or want to reproduce something that happened
months ago, I want strong guarantees that it will be similar, if not
identical. Now, this is just my opinion. I've worked in environments
where we had these strong guarantees. And having had this luxury,
I abhore the alternative where so many pieces of configuration vary
over time as the central configuration moves forward without the
ability to turn back the clock. As always, your needs may be
different and this post may not apply to you!</p>
<p>I said <em>as possible</em> a few times in the previous paragraph.
While you could likely make all parts of your configuration time
independent, it's not a good idea. In the real world, things
change over time and making all configuration data static regardless
of time will produce a broken or bad configuration.</p>
<p>User access is one such piece of configuration. Employees come and
go. Passwords and SSH keys change. You don't want to revert user
access to the way it was two months ago, restoring access to a
disgruntled former employee or allowing access via a compromised
password. Network configuration is another. Say the network topology
changed and the firewall rules need updating. If you reverted the
networking configuration, the machine likely wouldn't work on the
network!</p>
<p>This highlights an important fact: <strong>if making your machine
configuration time independent is a goal, you will need to
bifurcate configuration by time dependency and solve for both.</strong>
You'll need to identify every piece of configuration and
ask <em>do I put this in the bucket that is constant over time or
the bucket that changes over time?</em></p>
<p>Machine configuration software can do a terrific job of ensuring
an applied configuration is idempotent. The problem is it typically
can't manage both time-dependent and time-independent attributes
at the same time. Solving this requires a little brain power, but
is achievable if there is will. In the next section, I'll describe
how.</p>
<h4>Technical implementation</h4>
<p>Time-dependent machine configuration is a solved problem. Deploy
Puppet master (or similar) and you are good to go.</p>
<p>Time-independent configuration is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the first step is to isolate all of the
configuration you want to be time independent. Next, you need to
ensure time dependency doesn't creep into that configuration. You
need to identify things that can change over time and take
measures to ensure those changes won't affect the configuration.
I encourage you to employ the <em>external system
test</em>: <em>does this aspect of configuration depend on an external
system or entity? If so how will I prevent changes in it over
time from affecting us?</em></p>
<p>Package repositories are one such external system. New package
versions are released all the time. Old packages are deleted.
If your configuration says to install the <em>latest</em> package, there's
no guarantee the package version won't change unless the package
repository doesn't change. If you simply pin a package to a specific
version, that version may disappear from the server. The solution:
pin packages to specific versions <strong>and</strong> run your own package
mirror that doesn't delete or modify existing packages.</p>
<p>Does your configuration fetch a file from a remote server or use
a file as a template? Cache that file locally (in case it
disappears) and put it under version control. Have the configuration
reference the version control revision of that file. As long as the
repository is accessible, the exact version of the file can be
retrieved at any time without variation.</p>
<p>In my professional career, I've used two separate systems for
managing time-independent configuration data. Both relied heavily
on version control. Essentially, all the time-independent
configuration data is collected into a single repository - an
independent repository from all the time-dependent data
(although that's technically an implementation detail). For Puppet,
this would include all the manifests, modules, and files used
directly by Puppet. When you want to <em>activate</em> a machine with
a configuration, you simply say <em>check out revision X of this
repository and apply its configuration.</em> Since <em>revision X</em> of
the repository is constant over time, the set of configuration
data being used to configure the machine is constant. And, if
you've done things correctly, the output is idempotent over time.</p>
<p>In one of these systems, we actually had two versions of Puppet
running on a machine. First, we had the daemon communicating with a
central Puppet master. It was continually applying time-dependent
configuration (user accounts, passwords, networking, etc). We
supplemented this was a manually executed standalone Puppet
instance. When you ran a script, it asked the Puppet master for its
configuration. Part of that configuration was the revision of the
time-independent Git repository containing the Puppet configuration
files the client should use. It then pulled the Git repo, checked
out the specified revision, merged Puppet master's settings for the
node with that config (not the manifests, just some variables),
then ran Puppet locally to apply the configuration. While a
machine's configuration typically referenced a SHA-1 of a specific
Git commit to use, we could use anything <em>git checkout</em> understood.
We had some machines running <em>master</em> or other branches if we didn't
care about time-independent idempotency for that machine at that
time. What this all meant was that if you wanted to roll back
a machine's configuration, you simply specified an earlier Git
commit SHA-1 and then re-ran local Puppet.</p>
<p>We were largely satisfied with this model. We felt like we got
the best of both worlds. And, since we were using the same
technology (Puppet) for time-dependent and time-independent
configuration, it was a pretty simple-to-understand system.
A downside was there were two Puppet instances instead of one.
With a little effort, someone could probably devise a way for
the Puppet master to <em>merge</em> the two configuration trees. I'll
leave that as an exercise for the reader. Perhaps someone has
done this already! If you know of someone, please leave a comment!</p>
<h4>Challenges</h4>
<p>The solution I describe does not come without its challenges.</p>
<p>First, deciding whether a piece of configuration is time dependent
or time independent can be quiet complicated. For example,
should a package update for a critical security fix be time
dependent or time independent? It depends! What's the risk of
the machine not receiving that update? How often is that machine
rolled back? Is that package important to the operation/role
of that machine (if so, I'd lean more towards time independent).</p>
<p>Second, minimizing exposure to external entities is hard. While
I recommend putting as much as possible under version control in a
single repository and pinning versions everywhere when you interface
with an external system, this isn't always feasible. It's probably
a silly idea to have your 200 GB Apt repository under version
control and distributed locally to every machine in your network.
So, you end up introducing specialized one-off systems as necessary.
For our package repository, we just ran an internal HTTP server that
only allowed inserts (no deletes or mutates). If we were creative, we
could have likely devised a way for the client to pass a <em>revision</em> with
the request and have the server dynamically serve from that revision
of an underlying repository. Although, that may not work for every
server type due to limited control over client behavior.</p>
<p>Third, ensuring compatibility between the time-dependent configuration
and time-independent configuration is hard. This is a consequence of
separating those configurations. Will a time-independent configuration
from a revision two years ago work with the time-dependent
configuration of today? This issue can be mitigated by first
having as much configuration as possible be time independent and
second not relying on wide support windows. If it's good enough
to only support compatibility for time-independent configurations
less than a month old, then it's good enough! With this issue, I feel
you are trading long-term future incompatibility for well-defined
and understood behavior in the short to medium term. That's
a trade-off I'm willing to make.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Many machine configuration management systems only care about
idempotency <em>today</em>. However, with a little effort, it's possible
to achieve consistent state over time. This requires a little extra
effort and brain power, but it's certainly doable.</p>
<p>The next time you are programming your system configuration tool, I
hope you take the time to consider the effects time will have and that
you will take the necessary steps to ensure consistency over time
(assuming you want that, of course).</p>" nil nil "20b47774f4a8393a562f76e8e1028315") (118 (20937 23579 233950) "http://www.laurathomson.com/2013/06/ode-to-morgamic/" "Laura Thomson: Ode to Morgamic" "laura" "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 18:47:07 +0000" "<p>Mike Morgan - <a href=\"http://morgamic.com/\">morgamic</a> - was my boss for nearly six years. Friday was his last day working at Mozilla. I wanted to  write something to memorialize his departure, in the same way <a href=\"http://morgamic.com/2013/05/06/ode-to-james-socol/\">he did for  others</a>. Of course, this blog post will not be as eloquent as if he had  written it, but I will do my best.</p>
<p>There are two things that stand out about Morgamic: his leadership, and his passion for the Mozilla and the Open Web.</p>
<p>Morgamic  is that rare leader who, rather than rallying the troops from the  front, leads from beside you, encouraging you every step of the way. Morgamic is an introvert. Never let anyone tell you introverts can’t  lead. He excels at leadership because of his special talents for  introspection, reflection and the ability and willingness to listen.</p>
<p>He taught me, by example, and by teaching me to ask the right questions, three important things about leadership:</p>
<p>Enable autonomy by quiet leadership. In six years, I don’t think he  ever really told me to do anything. Like Confucius, he simply asked  questions that helped me figure it out for myself.</p>
<p>Trust people. I  can get really mad about things being done in a way I consider wrong.  He always encouraged me to ask myself why someone might be doing it that  way, and to trust that they were doing the best they could.</p>
<p>Reframe problems. Mike sees problems as complex and nuanced. It’s  never black or white: you just have to zoom out a little to see a  million solutions to a problem that you might not have seen before.</p>
<p>We  certainly had disagreements over the last few years, but  we always managed to resolve them in a constructive way, and that might  be the greatest lesson of all. As a technical leader, he goes out of his  way to hire people that he is confident are smarter than him, and he  never gets insecure about it. (In my case, I’m not sure he was right. He  certainly outdoes me in wisdom.) He coaches those people into  excellence. Morgamic is a force multiplier. Not only that, but he cares  about his people, and will go out of his way to help them develop into  the best and happiest versions of themselves.</p>
<p>Virtually every website you use at Mozilla was made with Morgamic’s  hands, Morgamic’s help, or Morgamic’s leadership. We still use code from  the first web app he ever built for Mozilla, when he was a volunteer:  Every time you update or download Firefox, you can do that because of  Morgamic.</p>
<p>Morgamic also has a vision and a passion for the Mozilla Mission and  the Open Web. If you’ve ever talked with him about it, you’ll know  exactly what I mean. With Mike, it always came back to two questions:  How does this move the mission forward? How does this benefit the Open  Web?</p>
<p>He also manages to bring humor and humanity into every action:  whether it’s org charts with Care Bears, photoshopping your head onto a  meerkat, or presenting interns with trophies at the end of the summer.  Once, when I had a sick pet and he knew I was really upset, he sent me a  giant bunch of flowers (’From the webdev team’). That made me cry,  quite a lot, but in a good way, I swear. I still have that card on my  desk, and I tear up every time I look at it.</p>
<p>I’m not the only one with stories. Here are some from other people  who have had the pleasure and privilege of working with Morgamic:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m not sure I consistently hear more praise for any other manager  at Mozilla as I do about Morgamic. That includes me hearing myself talk about  how pleased I’ve been over the past two years to have him mentor me —  and our entire team. I feel pushed to do great work because of him, but  in a way unique to him and Fred (who I have to think he mentored  well, given their similar management styles) — constantly encouraged and  pushed but with amazing empathy and reason for pushing me. He also encouraged us all to get along with each other and all of Mozilla,  taken what seems to me as the sanest growth plan in Mozilla, and  strived to build an awesome team instead of just a big one. He  encouraged us to reach out and include “former” colleagues and constantly  bring potentials into the webdev world.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Mike Morgan brought me to Mozilla, a move I had always wanted and was appreciative of. It wasn’t until I had to opportunity to really work with Mike and see him in action that I realized how much of a compliment it was to have him seek me. Mike invests so much into each of his developers that they can’t help but strive for greatness to repay the favor. Morgamic fought hard for his developers and made sure they were working on something they were passionate about. I’m proud to have worked with and for Mike Morgan and I’m already jealous of the next set of developers he’ll lead. Mozilla wont be the same without him. Legend.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Like many of us on the web development team, I came to Mozilla through  Mike. I’ve worked closely with him for 7 years and watched him grow  from a volunteer developer into a well respected leader. I watched a  team of two turn into a team of fifty with his expertise and guidance.  He is magnetic - someone who naturally acts as a hub, of people, of  information, and of value. He strived to be a better leader, reading  books, studying role models, and speaking with experts about how to  encourage excellence on his team. People who have worked with him will  understand how short “he’ll be missed” falls - we’re all fortunate to  have worked with him for this long, and really, I guess we’ve been  greedy, it’s only fair to let the rest of the world have a chance too. “</em></li>
<li><em>“Even when we disagreed he trusted me. He could have ordered me to do  something else, or ordered my boss to order me. Instead he’d take me for  coffee and try to convince me of another way. Usually he succeeded, but  when he didn’t he would go out of his way to support my decision. Our  products were a byproduct of his relentless focus on the team — hiring  the right people and trusting them to make the right decisions.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Morgamic embodied Mozilla in so many ways. He was a continual positive influence in everything we did in WebDev, always believing in people and trying to get them to improve themselves. But he went far beyond the boundaries of the team and influenced so many others. His legacy at Mozilla will continue on from those lucky enough to have worked with him.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Soon after I switched from the Webdev team to the Engagement team,  Morgamic walked by the glass walls of a meeting room I was doing a video  conference in. He walked away, came back with a whiteboard marker, drew  a heart, and left.</em><em><br />
I’d follow that man to Hades.” </em></li>
<li><em>“He helped me feel good at Mozilla very quickly. I like how he can be totally not serious sometimes, but efficient when he needs to. He gathered an impressive team of wonderful, excellent, incredible Web  devs (except me, of course, but every team has its weakness <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.laurathomson.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> ). </em><em>We were the first interns to win the Annual Employees VS Interns Basketball match!”</em></li>
<li><em>“Morgamic exemplified Mozilla for me. Openness, transparency, and just plain fight-for-the-user awesomeness. Morgamic was one of the few managers I’ve had who was less my superior and more my facilitator. He often acted like a Mozilla concierge - ensuring I had what I needed, intervening where I was blocked, and making sure I was happy and headed in the right direction. I don’t think I ever disagreed with his strategic decisions, which often had included my input or had at least been communicated to me early & often. Not that my agreement is needed to run the company, but it at least felt like he always had my back and we were doing things the right way.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’ve known and worked with Mike for ten years. On meeting him, I knew immediately that I had met one of those rare personalities that one encounters only only a few times in life. I watched Mike mature over the years in both his personal and professional life. One Mozilla cantina night, I recall sitting with Shaver and, possibly, Schrep: the conversation was about finding good engineering management. I remember pointing across the room to Mike, who likely at that moment was doing something very silly/dangerous will alcohol and fire. ‘There is your man, promote from within and you’ll see amazing things from him.’ I think I nailed it.”<br />
</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The words “he will be missed” are so far from adequate it’s not even funny.</p>
<p>His legacy at Mozilla will live on, in the projects he built, in the  people he mentored, through every Open Source project that comes out  of Webdev, in the Mozilla mission, and in the hearts of all of us. I  can’t wait to see what he pulls off next - I’ll be watching, and so  should you, because I have no doubt it will be amazing. Remember, too,  that being a Mozillian isn’t something that stops just because you  change jobs. It’s more like what happens when your best friend moves  away. Nothing changes except the logistics.</p>
<p>As for the rest of us, we will miss him, but we will go on working for the Open Web as the better people he helped us to be.</p>
<p>On  his last day working at Mozilla, Morgamic said, “Webdev isn’t a job,  it’s a movement.” I’ll leave you with that, and with this video, that I  know he liked to watch over and over:<br />

<h3>Diversity beyond gender</h3>
<p>My first session of the day was about creating welcoming spaces that encourage all kinds of diversity, rather than only focusing on gender. Those present were very interested in physical space issues involving hacker/maker spaces or running events. We discussed a set of practices that have worked in several spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the people involved set the agenda and define the uses of a space.</li>
<li>Create an environment where a person of color is not the only person of color when they walk in.</li>
<li>Describe a space as a “makerspace” rather than a “hackerspace”.</li>
<li>Make events invite-only to establish a welcoming culture.</li>
<li>Don’t say “please come if you are a woman”. This is tokenizing language that discourages participation. </li>
<li>Invite everyone to organize events, not just attend events.</li>
<li>Invite people to events through existing, established groups.</li>
<li>Spend time thinking about who and what is missing from a group or space and take action to fix or change. </li>
</ul>
<p>Patterns of exclusion start long before we deal with them in technology culture.</p>
<h3>Being feminine in tech</h3>
<p>This was a very large group, so we attempted to focus discussion on some key issues. I was also reminded of “<a href=\"http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Grunch\">grunch</a>“, the feeling you get when you’ve suddenly been reminded that you’ve got a feminine body.</p>
<p>Our initial set of discussion topics were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Masculinity valued over femininity — how do we get to express a masculine identity in an authentic way and not devalue femininity? Are we expressing masculinity because it’s who we are or because we perceive it as having more value?</li>
<li>How “woman” can I be? do I have to switch to their language? what rules do I have follow?</li>
<li>How do I make suggestions for a more gender neutral culture in the workplace?</li>
<li>Peer shaming if you represent as highly feminine or androgynous</li>
<li>Reacting to the hyper masculine by occupying a more feminine place despite its authenticity</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants shared a series of stories about their experiences expressing feminine or masculine dress, haircut, physical attributes. Most of the descriptions were posed as experiments — “I spent a month wearing dresses to normalize femininity in my workplace and here’s what happened.” The experiments women are running on themselves and their coworkers to try to get people used to women in the workplace are fascinating and shocking. Reflecting on the discussion, I felt like we were back in pre-women’s suffrage, where men were shocked at women working or wanting equal rights.</p>
<p>I also realized that I think about issues with what I wear a lot, but rarely talk about it with my colleagues.</p>
<p>I learned about differentiating between a few different concepts when talking about expressing femininity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gender policing: comments designed to inform someone that they’re violating an accepted norm. Examples include being described as “dressing too slutty”, aggressive attention when a woman has a shaved head and looks masculine or androgynous. </li>
<li>Masculine assimilation: dressing more masculine to avoid unwanted attention</li>
<li>Feminine presentation seen as inviting sexual attention: several people described a dramatic change in behavior among colleagues or students when women wore traditionally feminine clothing (skirts, dresses, blouses)</li>
<li>Peer shaming: in this context, we discussed concerns with women who shame other women over appearing/acting too feminine, or using feminine symbols like the color pink.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was a lot more to this conversation. Looking back over the notes, I am a bit overwhelmed at how much ground we covered among so many people in just an hour. This session also led to some other hallway track conversations where I learned a bit more about how individuals are trying to balance their activism with their personal relationships with other women in open source/hardware/culture communities.</p>
<h3>Hardware hacking!</h3>
<p>I spent some time with the hardware hackers. Several women brought soft circuits, and one person brought a soldering station so that people could try out soldering for the first time. I was trying to get some IR LEDs integrated into a headband, and we had some issues with the shape and the stretchiness of our material. Other folks at the table were making blinking fuzzy muppet/monsters for their badges. Lots of very adorable blinky things were assembled.</p>
<p>I did demonstrate how to troubleshoot LEDs and what IR light looks like on digital cameras. I talked a bit more about medical devices with someone looking into how to hack her own augmentations. It felt a little like a “from the future” conversation. <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<h3>Mozilla contributor dinner</h3>
<p>I spent Sunday evening having dinner with some Mozilla contributors from France and a couple coworkers. I was probably the only person at the table who spoke only English, reminding me that I really aught to keep up on my language lessons. <img alt=\":D\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" /> </p>
<p>I caught my buddy Diane up on what had happened at AdaCamp, met Delphine’s husband and tried to convince some contributors to lead an effort to have an AdaCamp in Europe!</p>
<p>By the end of the evening, I was ready to collapse and get back to Portland!</p>
<h3>Summing up</h3>
<p>My last post about AdaCamp will be reflecting on all three of the camps – starting in Melbourne, Australia, then Washington, DC and finally in San Francisco. The event has grown from about 40 people to 200+, and for me, is the most exciting gathering of women in open source, open hardware and open culture. I’ve never been around so many women who share the same values, who are fighting for openness in technology and who are focused on tearing down the many barriers we face to involving more women in our technical communities.</p>" nil nil "d1b54e8aa1544cb3fc8b5e4142b9f1c2") (116 (20937 23579 225377) "http://dutherenverseauborddelatable.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/alors-comme-ca-votre-projet-a-besoin-de-contributeurs/" "David Rajchenbach Teller: Alors comme =?utf-8?Q?=C3=A7a=2C?= votre projet a besoin de contributeurs ?"

<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">C’est une histoire assez triste. Elle vous est peut-être familière, soit dans la peau du contributeur existant, soit dans la peau de l’anonyme qui voulait contribuer. Cette histoire est malheureusement fréquente dans les projets qui cherchent à s’étendre. Voyons ce que nous pourrions faire pour changer la fin du conte.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Il était une fois un projet de logiciel libre (ou, d’ailleurs, un projet associatif). Un jour, un anonyme se présenta et annonça qu’il souhaitait aider. C’était une bonne nouvelle, car le projet avait bien besoin de contributeurs supplémentaires.

<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Malgré tous les efforts des contributeurs existants, l’histoire est toujours aussi triste. Alors que faire pour arriver à une fin heureuse ?</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Il était une fois un projet de logiciel libre (ou, d’ailleurs, un projet associatif).

<h3>Le système des bugs mentorés</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chez Mozilla, nous utilisons depuis quelques années le système que je viens de décrire, avec un succès impressionnant. Tous les quelques jours, sur les projets que je suis, de nouveaux contributeurs se présentent, suivent les tutoriels, choisissent une tâche, se mettent immédiatement au travail – et finissent la plupart du temps par publier leurs contributions, et un peu plus tard par devenir eux-mêmes mentors sur d’autres tâches.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Marquer une tâche comme mentorée prend environ deux secondes.</p>
<ol>
<li>je viens d’ouvrir un bug sur Bugzilla et je réalise qu’un débutant pourrait certainement le traiter avec un peu d’aide ;</li>
<li>j’ajoute dans le champ libre (« whiteboard ») du bug l’information [mentor=Yoric] – à partir de ce moment-là, les nouveaux venus peuvent trouver ce bug dans notre moteur de recherche de bugs mentorés ;</li>
<li>j’en profite pour ajouter dans ce même champ libre l’information [lang=js][lang=c++] – à partir de ce moment-là, les nouveaux venus cherchant des bugs dans l’une des deux technologies “JavaScript” ou “C++” verront s’afficher ce bug ;</li>
<li>c’est fini – un de ces jours, un contributeur me contactera peut-être pour demander s’il peut travailler sur ce bug.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bien entendu, l’exemple utilise Bugzilla et des contributions techniques mais il est assez simple d’étendre le système à d’autres gestionnaires de tâches et à des tâches purement non techniques.</p>
<p>Pour un nouveau venu, commencer est aussi très simple :</p>
<ol>
<li>lire <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/introduction\">notre document d’introduction</a> et suivre le lien vers <a href=\"http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/?unowned=1\">le moteur de recherche de bugs mentorés</a> ;</li>
<li>choisir des centres d’intérêt et un bug ;</li>
<li>contacter le mentor par mail ou par irc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Certaines étapes peuvent encore être fluidifiées (le nom et l’adresse du mentor ne sont pas toujours évidents à trouver à l’écran, etc.) mais c’est en cours. Nous espérons que le système pourra, à terme, être généralisé à tous les projets de Mozilla, techniques ou non.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Du coup, si vous participez à un projet (Mozilla ou autre) qui n’emploie pas un tel système de bugs mentorés et qui cherche des contributeurs, je vous invite vivement à essayer.</p>

ads because of third party cookies, and in general about the lack
of privacy on the internets</p>
<p>I made the decision to not depend on a couple of big companies
anymore for all my data in the cloud and to pay for the services
I really needed & use the proper Firefox addons to cut down
on the ads.</p>
<p>I slowly moved away from Google.</p>
<p>I moved to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.newsblur.com/\">NewsBlur</a>
instead of Google Reader - before Reader was planned to be stopped.</p>
<p>I moved from Gmail to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://fastmail.fm\">fastmail.fm</a>. That was the
hardest one because I was on Gmail since 2004.</p>
<p>Last, I moved from the Google search engine to DuckDuckGo, then
to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://startpage.com/\">StartPage</a>. The latter gives better
results than DuckDuckGo in general because it's a proxy on the
top of Google search engine. It just secures your privacy and
unlike DDG, you won't get <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/privacy\">Amazon referral links in your results</a>  I'd rather pay a yearly
rate at DDG rather than this referral system.</p>
<p>Anyways, I kept my Google account for two reasons: redirecting mails
to my fastmail account and using Google+ because I like this service
a lot. The redirection is not important anymore. After over a year of
redirection - people should know how to reach me :)</p>
<p>I also had Facebook to stay connected with my non-geek friends
mostly. I also use Twitter a lot.</p>
<p>However, the recent privacy scandals made me think a bit about
how I use all these services.</p>
<p>First of all, G+ and Facebook provide features to share <strong>privately</strong>
some data to a specific set of people. We've seen that our privacy
is not guaranteed. They'll give your data away if they're asked.</p>
<p>And well, they are commercial companies that need to sell ads,
so your private content is used anyways. Just look at the ads that
are displayed besides your e-mail when you use GMail.</p>
<p>So while there's an incentive to let you share data thinking
it's not public, shit happens. So I don't see the point of pushing
anything non-public in those silos. And it turns out that I am mostly
a consumer so I am fine using apps like G+ with no account -- and if possible
via <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor</a>.</p>
<p>If I have cool stuff to talk about, I can blog and probably
do a better job in one blog post than in numerous G+ or FB posts.</p>
<p>Twitter on the other hand, is mostly shouting out in public your
opinions, promoting your projects. I barely use the DM feature.</p>
<p>Twitter is not different of course from Google & Facebook - they
need to sell ads and your data is used for this, but at least it's
easier to control that you're only pushing public stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Given all of this, I have deleted my Google and Facebook accounts yesterday</strong></p>
<p>(well, for FB unfortunately I reactivated it today because I lost
access to my Spotify Premium account - so until this is solved, my FB
is still active but it's a matter of days.)</p>
<p>All of this if of course is the tip of the iceberg since we eventually
found out that governments can just extract content from the flow that
goes through undersea cables.</p>
<p>But what I am doing is still important. It's a political act that will
shape the future if we're a bunch of people acting like this.
We need to show through our online habits and actions that we care about
our privacy.</p>
<p>On the phone side, I guess I am in a pretty good shape since I use Firefox OS.

<h3>Keynote</h3>
<p>James Vasile opened this year’s Open Source Bridge with the first keynote of the week and he chose a serious topic: how we are living in an age of surveillance and that we need to create solutions to protect free speech.  Vasile referenced recent events like the Edward Snowden’s leak of the National Security Agency’s PRISM program and Internet Censorship in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Vasile talked fondly of the importance of open tools on the internet and technologies like encryption and pointed out that policy makers will not bring change.</p>
<h3>Sessions of Interest</h3>
<p>The first session of the day I attended was “Taming Your Inner Cowboy Coder – A Simple And Sane DevOps Workflow” a talk given by Greg Lund-Chaix and Evan Heidtmann. The talk discussed the tools and best practices for devops while working in development and production environments.</p>
<p>Next up was “DIY Electric Vehicles” a talk given by Ben Kero who works at Mozilla. Kero had informative slides and a even more informative talk as he shared his expertise in a hobby he has picked up: building DIY Electric Vehicles. Kero decribed the possibilities of making electric-powered bikes and cars and the anatomy of such vehicles and the basics of how to get started.</p>

The talk was packed with great slides and useful information and Kero stayed after to answer questions of people who were interesting in making apps or even porting Firefox OS.</p>
<p>I look forward to day two of Open Source Bridge tomorrow and the 5th Year Anniversary Party this Thursday at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.

I would switch to a Community Flavor and see how it worked and see if I could keep it as my desktop instead of Ubuntu.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The requirements I had for desktop challenge:</p>
<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">
<li>Must be Ubuntu Community Flavor</li>
<li>Firefox shipped as default browser</li>
<li>Preference to lighter weight DE</li>
<li>Solid Support and Dev Sub-Community</li>
<li>Must respect <a href=\"http://blog.sidstamm.com/2012/12/what-is-privacy.html\" target=\"_blank\">privacy</a></li>
</ul>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The conclusion for me based on those requirements was that Xubuntu was the best candidate for my 30-day challenge although I did consider Kubuntu. But their lack of shipping Firefox as a default was a deal breaker for me even though they still have an equally crisp desktop.</p>

a week, to start a new job at Mozilla.</p>
<p>That was a huge change in my life since I had to interact daily with people
in English, cope with the 9 hours timezone and try to keep up the pace of
working with smarter people than me (I am still the dumbest.)</p>
<p>I was the only guy in Europe in the Services team, and had to wait until
7pm to actually chat with my colleagues and exchange info. I had numerous
late nights of work the first year.</p>
<p>But it was worthing the pain: I was the first Python guy in the Services
team and worked to convert the Firefox Sync server to a \"state of the art\"
Python application, along with all the ecosystem around it.</p>
<p>A big challenge I was quite proud of taking. I was trusted to do the
right things and helped the team moving off the PHP version.</p>
<p>The Python launch did not go well because of a bug we could not really
have avoided, and I had a few sleepless nights and nightmares before
everything went back to normal. Eventually, the Python version worked
very well and the next apps were built using the same tools & recipes.</p>
<p>The team grew and more Python folks joined later on. I've learned a lot
during that time and looking back, those stressful weeks were the
best times I had.</p>
<p>Since that first year, a lot of things have changed at Mozilla:
Alexis joined the team and I slowly went back to a normal schedule
since we've managed to start a 'Europe team' and work together.</p>
<p>The new Paris office opened a few months ago and you can feel
that the Europe side of Mozilla is growing big time.</p>
<p>I don't feel like a remote guy away from his office anymore
so that's great :)</p>
<p>These days I am doing a lot of work in building tools for
server-side developers. I should include qa and devops as well.</p>
<p>Namely: Circus, Vaurien, Loads & Cornice.</p>
<p>I love what I am doing and I think those tools are useful
outside our team itself.</p>
<p>Circus & Cornice are starting to get patches from outside
Mozilla so that's great.</p>
<p>Last but not least: Everytime a privacy or a patent scandal
occurs, I am proud that my thoughts & opinions are exactly
the ones that are defended and echoed by Mozilla voices.

One variant that has applications far beyond initial import is contact sharing via Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
It would be great if I could send contacts back and forth between all my devices, including the Firefox OS ones. Other phones usually can send and receive contacts in VCard (.vcf) format via Bluetooth, but Firefox OS so far is missing this functionality (even though some VCard support exists for import from SD card in 1.1, though I could never get that to work for me).<br />
<br />
A reasonably usable implementation for sharing could be implemented as an app: It would need to read from the Contacts API, present a selection to the user, assemble VCard files and send those off via a Web Activity so the existing Bluetooth sharing can act on them. With that, the sending side should work.<br />
The receiving side would be a bit more hacky, but also doable: Unfortunately, the existing Bluetooth support does not call a Web Activity for handling not explicitely supported file types, it only ends up saving them on the SD card. So the contact sharing app would need to periodically look for new VCard files in that location, read and offer to import them, and finally use the Contacts API again to write them into the system's database.<br />
<br />
If someone would pick up the needed work there, I'm sure the app would be quite popular, and I'd love to use it myself. Ultimately, I think this functionality should be part of the official Contacts apps, so having any such app available under a licence that allows Gaia to use the code would be great. Still, I think it would be awesome to have the app so the soon-shipping Firefox-OS-1.0.1-powered devices can use them.<br />

I live it, I breathe it, I was there when it became available to a larger audience at an affordable rate and I have seen it grow more and more to the most interesting, versatile and easiest to participate media out there. I’ve witnessed the power it gives to people who have no voice in traditional media and give people education where their social standing or school system would not support them.</p>
<p>This is why it hurts me to see people squander the opportunity that is the web away by clogging it with short-lived, let’s say it – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE0CRMm59BY\">bullshit</a>. Sure, this is a natural thing – the web is a normal part of our lives and the new generation of users is web-native, meaning they don’t know any longer what it would be like to be offline. When we stop seeing something as hard to get it becomes a commodity and we value it less. Didn’t have to fight for it, so why see it as something I should care for? It is always there, isn’t it? Much like we waste drinking water until we lived in a country where you couldn’t drink from the tap.</p>
<p><img alt=\"didn't read, LOL - apparently something to be proud of…\" src=\"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/198/460/iwkoqt.gif\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>The time when we listened to random beeping sounds from our modems and got excited when we got a full 56KB connection for a change are over. Mobile connectivity is still a problem, and sometimes gets expensive but even then the connection speeds are great. That is when you are in the country where your mobile contract and in “first world” countries. Get out of this world and you still feel the flakiness of connectivity and you get much more grateful for information becoming available after the third exasperated reload of the current web page.</p>
<p>And this is where I get very disappointed when I see that we are moving into a world where people stop using text and words to describe their feelings, ideas and plans and – well, <em>communicate</em> with others. Instead we are confronted with an avalanche of images, memes, animated GIFs of several megabytes and age-old fake conversations, jokes and “inspirational quotes” as badly optimised JPGs full of artifacts. We also get a lot of messages that could be a short post in the form of a video with terrible lighting and bad audio. They are easy to make, but they are much harder to consume. I can skim a long text until it gets interesting. I can not do that with a video unless I have a timed transcript.</p>
<p>I am not even going to start on the accessibility issues that come from a web that consists solely of images and videos. I am talking about incredibly useful technology and systems that are available to us as a result of a just a bit more than a decade of web evolution becoming useless.</p>
<p>Search engines like text. You will get your productions on the web found by having good text in there. Your images and videos can be as amazing as they come – if there is no descriptive text all you get is traffic coming from people seeing your things and sharing them. This can be incredibly powerful – something “going viral” can get you a lot of hits and shares in a very short amount of time and give you the false impression that you are a success and made an impact on the web. But the success is fleeting and a few minutes later the next cool thing will come around. A day later other people will share your work as theirs and again get a quick fix of fame. It is turning the web into a pure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber\">Operant Conditioning Chamber</a>, the same phenomenon that powers casual online gaming and makes people give up on privacy, as explained eloquently by <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxObserver-Cory-Doctorow\">Cory Doctorow in his TEDxObserver talk</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, social sharing also has great benefits beyond the quick fame. People describing your work in their words when sharing can add different language explanations or give your content more impact as an important voice people trust tweeted about it, but it relies on the good-will of people consuming what you produce and making the effort to share it or write words around it. If you provided the words from the beginning, you’ll get this as extra on top of people who will find your work using search engines – because you used text. And even better, if someone gets to your product and doesn’t speak your language, they can use a free translation service to get the product in at least an approximation of their language. We can use web technology to make products more accessible to us without having to rely on a social interaction of someone capable of both languages to do the work for us.</p>
<p>Above all, what bugs me is that the flood of memes, animated GIFs and videos and their quick, false fame robs new users of the web of the opportunity to learn how to speed-read, write and – above all – communicate in writing. I learned English in a few ways. First of all, in school, which works well if your teacher is not a non-native English speaker just trying to get through the curriculum. Secondly, I watched English TV series (Monty Python, as this was the only non-dubbed show) with subtitles. This taught me to understand English and thus – subconsciously – how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>A large part of me learning other languages though was through text communication with people from other countries. First on notes sent on floppy disks in the mail trading demos and tools, then on BBSes and then on the web. Reading and writing comments, hanging out on <span class=\"caps\">IRC</span> and having many a fight and a lot of brainstorming there, taking part in forums and mailing lists, newsgroups and finally in social networks like Facebook and Google+. I could talk to someone on the other side of the globe, in real time, and it didn’t take ages to get a video or suffered from bad audio on a phone call or voice call.</p>
<p>It baffles me to see that we have a world-wide communication network with a very low barrier to entry and nearly no expense on publishing and we don’t use it to better ourselves, to make us better communicators. Instead we complain that governments don’t do enough to make school education better. Today you don’t need to buy a book in another language and wait for it in the mail. You can get it online and read it in Kindle, Google Play books, or even go to <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/‎\">Project Gutenberg</a> and read them for free. And yet people using proper grammar on the web are congratulated for it or – more commonly – made fun of. A higher level of education should not be a surprise in a world that has access to the largest library ever. It should be a given.</p>
<p>Words are powerful, they spark a theatre in the head. People reading your words make their own pictures at a speed pictures could never be transmitted. Instead of giving one image you create a gallery, one that you will never see, but your readers do. And this gallery is very personal to them and thus gets remembered much more. Of course words can cause controversy, misunderstandings and can hurt. But even then they can spark a conversation and make you realise the effect of your actions much more than a “like” or an “upvote” could ever do.</p>
<p>The old saying that a picture says a thousand words is true when it comes to explanations. Re-hashing memes and jumping on bandwagons based on current pop culture references that will be impossible to grasp a month later doesn’t say a thousand words. It basically says “I am lazy, here is a quick laugh to hint at my creativity”. We are blessed to be able to transmit our thoughts to an audience we will never be able to meet physically. We should not squander this.</p>
<p>Please, use your words. Turn on that grammar check, re-read that tweet before you send it. Write a short sentence instead of posting a meme we’ve seen thousands of times before. And don’t get discouraged when people don’t jump on it and thank you or go nuts about it. This is not for fame, this is for you. If all technology fails, words and gestures is what we have. You can exercise and train your brain to paint with words, to create gorgeous constructs. You get better the more you push yourself to not be lazy and use the obvious word but one that is more specific. Words are beautiful. Paint with them, compose with them, woo people with them.</p>

the mail, but hadn't had a chance to open the package until today
(crazy life stuff).</p>
<p>I'm running Debian Testing and had done some Gaia/FirefoxOS work in
late 2012. I had my development environment still set up including adb
and fastboot.</p>
<p>I wanted to switch the phone to the nightly channel which is what I
was using (or thought I was using) with my Unagi. Mostly I followed

phone/Geeksphone</a>.</p>
<p>After doing that, I moved my SIM card over as well as the Micro SD
card I had in my Unagi phone. The Micro SD card has all my media on
it---not my suer data. I thought about moving my user data over, but
I've had the Unagi so long that I figured my user data is probably in
a funky state anyhow and better to start over.</p>
<p>Couple of thoughts:</p>
<ol class=\"arabic simple\">
<li>The nightly build is version 2.0.0-prerelease.</li>
<li>The phone is a lot bigger than the Unagi---it'll take a bit of
getting used to.</li>
<li>Most things worked fine. I even got a marketing message from
T-Mobile minutes after I inserted my SIM card and got on the
network.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few issues (the camera is not working at all). I need to
spend some time with Bugzilla to file those with useful
data. Regardless, the phone is working pretty well and I'm probably
going to switch to it as my primary phone soon. That might give me

<p><strong>Stereotype:</strong>  <em>something that may be true about some members of a group, but not all, and yet is applied to all members of the group without regard for the individual. While stereotype might be a scary word to some people, worry not – they are within your control to manipulate, eliminate, and examine thoroughly for holes in logic.</em></p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Debunk your internally held stereotypes, and not just once.</strong></p>
<p>Unpacking a stereotype you’ve held for any length of time is not a ‘set it and forget it’ process.  It came as quite a shock to me this past weekend when I became aware of the deep levels of distrust I had been holding toward new hires within the last 2 years. These are people who were in the ranks of our explosive growth spurt* and when I examined this feeling I saw that I didn’t believe this new bunch of Mozillians could be as hooked, committed, and passionate as myself.</p>
<p>It dawned on me over the course of our intensive 2 days of plenary activities that I held this belief while still going day to day believing what I care most about is bring new people into the community.  And I do care about this, but I see now how my stereotyping might also be holding me back.  When I bring someone into the community or get a chance to passionately wax on how Mozilla has changed my life I like to think I can tell if they are also catching the fever. For me, it’s been such a good pairing of challenging technical work and new areas to practice social justice activism in, so I’ll evangelize to anyone who’s interested while also inquiring with them to discover what area of Mozilla contribution might be a good starting place for them. I expect to see a similar spark of what is possible, working with Mozilla, for their passion. When I’m able, I try to help them network and make connections within the project to help clear barriers to their goals and find a mentor.  Again, that’s based on my experience of coming on board with the help of a strong mentor as well as having social connections to leaders within the organization.</p>
<p>If it’s not apparent yet, I am trying to recreate for others what I saw as the perfect ‘hook’. I believe I have a strong set of core values that align with being Mozillian and I want to install them into others. <strong>Here’s the catch:</strong> becoming a Mozillian isn’t close to how, in a perfect world, one might install a binary package containing certain values into a person and we have no reliable test of whether it patches correctly and provides a guaranteed shared core with each other.</p>
<p>After this weekend, and talking deeply and at great lengths with people who have joined the community in the last two years, who have obvious passion & commitment to the Mozilla mission, I have started unpacked my stereotype of a what makes a new Mozillian passionate and what hooks them.  It’s something I will have to keep reminding myself of.  The reminder will look like asking people what <strong><em>their</em></strong> hook was instead of looking for mine in them.  Knowing logistically that it was impossible for everyone to have my exact experience but trusting they had <strong><em>something</em></strong> to activate them in the ways I felt mattered were not aligning at all until I got to spend this time having what sometimes seemed like the same conversation over and over.  I was with 60 people where at least half of them were brought on in the last two years and yet, the discussions were passionate, committed, and inspiring. I am thankful for our process that it allowed me to have this revelation that will help me be a better Mozillian and community leader in the future.</p>
<p>In the actions I have leading up to the Summit, one is to look closer at the ‘hooks’ of others and to work on how we might abstract & synthesize those into options for new Mozillians to have an activity to engage in where we can be as close as 100% certain as possible that they’ve been activated as Mozillians with the core values we’re wanting to trust each other has. A follow-up post will talk about the core values and their importance to several other big topics for Summit 2013.</p>

Firefox for Android 24 will bring a lot of noticeable improvements for users of TalkBack and alternative Android screen readers. Here’s a round-up of those enhancements and new features:</p>
<h3>Braille</h3>
<p>Firefox 24 brings <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.googlecode.eyesfree.brailleback\">BrailleBack</a> support. The braille output is not merely a mirror of the speech output, but rather a smart representation of the current and surrounding items. You can use the navigational commands of your display to navigate web content, and you can use routing keys to activate the current item. This may activate a link, press a button, toggle a check box, or whatever action an ordinary double-tap or press of the D-pad Enter would also execute.</p>
<h3>New default reading order</h3>
<p>A new order of reading information has been introduced, which may soon become the default reading order for new installs. When activated and TalkBack speaks the current item, it now speaks the name, label or text first, followed by semantic information such as the type (like link, button etc.) and the ancestry. This way, the most important information is spoken first.</p>
<p>If you want to try the new reading order, you can do this by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the address bar, type <a>about:config</a> and press enter.</li>
<li>In the search field, type access.</li>
<li>Look for the entry named accessfu.utterance and double-tap it.</li>
<li>Change its value from 0 to 1.</li>
<li>Close the tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, your reading order will be the new one with the label of the current item first. To change back to the way it was before, follow the above steps and change the value back from 1 to 0.</p>
<h3>Editing text</h3>
<p>Editing text is finally possible in text inputs and text areas of web pages! You can navigate by character, word, and in text areas, paragraph, too. With this, having control over what you’ve written and correcting what you typed is finally possible! I know you were waiting a long time for this! <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.marcozehe.de/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<h3>Text areas now activate</h3>
<p>It was previously not possible to activate many text areas and get a keyboard to input text. This has been fixed. Examples of this bug could be seen in Facebook and Mobile Twitter when trying to compose a status update or tweet.</p>
<h3>Skipping of decorative images</h3>
<p>Images which web authors clearly marked as decorative with the expression <em>alt=”\"</em> are now properly skipped when navigating through web content. This should eliminate a lot of unnecessary stops on graphics which have no meaning for the understanding of the content.</p>
<h3>Better speaking of rich labeled content</h3>
<p>Firefox for Android now properly exposes explicitly given labels of web content instead of always trying to get the label from the inner text of that element. If an aria-label or other means of labelling an element is being used, for example on Facebook or Twitter, it will now be spoken and brailled.</p>
<h3>Popups are announced</h3>
<p>If the activation of an element causes a pop up to appear, this will now be announced. Examples of that are the items for Friend requests, Messages, and Notifications on Facebook.</p>
<h3>Closing all tabs no longer breaks web content support</h3>
<p>There was a bug that caused all web content to no longer be accessible once all tabs had been closed. You had to close and restart Firefox for Android to get TalkBack support working again. This has been fixed.</p>
<h3>Double-tap and hold in web content</h3>
<p>There was a bug that you could not use the double-tap and hold gesture to bring up the context menu for any given web element with TalkBack. This has been fixed, and you can now access all the features of those context menus.</p>
<h3>Door hangers retain focus</h3>
<p>There was a bug in the door hanger notifications, like the Save Password prompt, that caused focus to get lost frequently. This has been fixed.</p>
<h3>More changes</h3>
<p>There have been quite some more changes under the hood you will not notice immediately, but which all add to a much better user experience.</p>
<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>A big thank you goes out to Max, who is a summer intern at Mozilla this year, and to Yura, who is a very active community contributor. And of course to Eitan, whose main work is concentrated on getting Firefox OS accessibility in shape, but who always finds the energy to keep the rest of us in check when we hack on Firefox for Android! <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.marcozehe.de/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<h3>So when will you get it?</h3>
<p>Firefox 24 will hit the Play Store in August as <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox_beta\">Firefox Beta</a>, and in September as the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox\">final release</a>. If you’re on Firefox <a href=\"http://nightly.mozilla.org\">Nightly builds</a>, you already have all these great enhancements on your device. And if you’re using <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/aurora/\">Aurora</a>, you’ll get it in the week of June 24, 2013.</p>
<p>We hope that you’ll enjoy these enhancements and definitely value your feedback! Also keep those bug reports coming, they are very helpful and will assist us in making Firefox for Android and Firefox OS even better!</p>

<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Il était une fois un projet de logiciel libre (ou, d’ailleurs, un projet associatif). Un jour, un anonyme se présenta et annonça qu’il souhaitait aider. C’était une bonne nouvelle, car le projet avait bien besoin de contributeurs supplémentaires. Malheureusement, au bout de quelques jours, l’anonyme disparût, car il n’arrivait pas à aider.</em></p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">C’est une histoire assez triste. Elle vous est peut-être familière, soit dans la peau du contributeur existant, soit dans la peau de l’anonyme qui voulait contribuer. Cette histoire est malheureusement fréquente dans les projets qui cherchent à s’étendre. Voyons ce que nous pourrions faire pour changer la fin du conte.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Il était une fois un projet de logiciel libre (ou, d’ailleurs, un projet associatif). Un jour, un anonyme se présenta et annonça qu’il souhaitait aider. C’était une bonne nouvelle, car le projet avait bien besoin de contributeurs supplémentaires. Les contributeurs existants avaient justement préparé des documents pour guider des nouveaux venus et étaient prêts à répondre aux questions de l’anonyme. L’anonyme suivit le guide de contribution. Après avoir suivi ce guide, l’anonyme chercha à quoi il pouvait bien contribuer. Malheureusement, au bout de quelques jours ou quelques semaines, l’anonyme n’avait pas trouvé en quoi il pouvait aider et il disparût.</em></p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Malgré tous les efforts des contributeurs existants, l’histoire est toujours aussi triste. Alors que faire pour arriver à une fin heureuse ?</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Il était une fois un projet de logiciel libre (ou, d’ailleurs, un projet associatif). Comme dans tous les projets de ce genre, il y avait énormément de choses à faire et pas assez de contributeurs pour tout accomplir. Les contributeurs avaient pris pour habitude de noter sur une liste de tâche facilement accessible tout ce qu’ils n’avaient pas encore eu le temps de mener à bien. Certaines de ces tâches étaient accessibles à des nouveaux venus. Pensant aux futurs contributeurs, les contributeurs existants s’assuraient donc que ces tâches accessibles étaient faciles à trouver et que n’importe quel nouveau venu pouvait facilement contacter la personne qui avait ajouté la tâche dans la liste, pour lui demander des conseils. De plus, les contributeurs existants avaient préparé des documents pour guider des nouveaux venus et étaient prêts à répondre aux questions de l’anonyme. L’anonyme suivit le guide de contribution, qui le mena à des tâches accessibles. Il trouva une tâche qui l’intéressait et un mentor pour l’aider à démarrer. Ils vécurent heureux et eurent beaucoup de contributions.</em></p>
<h3>Le système des bugs mentorés</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chez Mozilla, nous utilisons depuis quelques années le système que je viens de décrire, avec un succès impressionnant. Tous les quelques jours, sur les projets que je suis, de nouveaux contributeurs se présentent, suivent les tutoriels, choisissent une tâche, se mettent immédiatement au travail – et finissent la plupart du temps par publier leurs contributions, et un peu plus tard par devenir eux-mêmes mentors sur d’autres tâches.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Marquer une tâche comme mentoré prend environ deux secondes.</p>
<ol>
<li>je viens d’ouvrir un bug sur Bugzilla et je réalise qu’un débutant pourrait certainement le traiter avec un peu d’aide ;</li>
<li>j’ajoute dans le champ libre (« whiteboard ») du bug l’information [mentor=Yoric] – à partir de ce moment-là, les nouveaux venus peuvent trouver ce bug dans notre moteur de recherche de bugs mentorés ;</li>
<li>j’en profite pour ajouter dans ce même champ libre l’information [lang=js][lang=c++] – à partir de ce moment-là, les nouveaux venus cherchant des bugs dans l’une des deux technologies “JavaScript” ou “C++” verront s’afficher ce bug ;</li>
<li>c’est fini – un de ces jours, un contributeur me contactera peut-être pour demander s’il peut travailler sur ce bug.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bien entendu, l’exemple utilise Bugzilla et des contributions techniques mais il est assez simple d’étendre le système à d’autres gestionnaires de tâches et à des tâches purement non techniques.</p>
<p>Pour un nouveau venu, commencer est aussi très simple :</p>
<ol>
<li>lire <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/introduction\">notre document d’introduction</a> et suivre le lien vers <a href=\"http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/?unowned=1\">le moteur de recherche de bugs mentorés</a> ;</li>
<li>choisir des centres d’intérêt et un bug ;</li>
<li>contacter le mentor par mail ou par irc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Certaines étapes peuvent encore être fluidifiées (le nom et l’adresse du mentor ne sont pas toujours évidents à trouver à l’écran, etc.) mais c’est en cours. Nous espérons que le système pourra, à terme, être généralisé à tous les projets de Mozilla, techniques ou non.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Du coup, si vous participez à un projet (Mozilla ou autre) qui n’emploie pas un tel système de bugs mentorés et qui cherche des contributeurs, je vous invite vivement à essayer.</p>

Under the description “Firefox <span class=\"caps\">OS </span>- the platform <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> deserves” (a slogan I used in a few talks and interviews already) these videos are meant to explain a few things:</p>
<p></p><ul><li>What Firefox OS is</li><li>How it is different to any other mobile platform</li><li>What it means for <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> as a movement</li><li>How you can be part of it</li><li>What its benefits are to you (a stable <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> platform with full hardware access aimed at a completely new and huge market of end users)</li><li>How to get started</li><li>Where to find documentation and file complaints and enhancement ideas</li></ul><p></p>
<p>All in all, we thought a series of videos would be a good way to get the message out that scales better than talks and posts. Each of the videos will be about five minutes long and an interview/conversation between experts and me, namely in this case Daniel Appelquist (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/torgo\"> @torgo</a>) from <a href=\"http://blog.digital.telefonica.com\">Téléfonica Digital</a>/ <span class=\"caps\">W3C</span> and Desigan Chinniah (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/cyberdees\"> @cyberdees</a>) from Mozilla.

<p>✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈</p>
<p>We are a group of very smart people. Don’t ever doubt that for a second. We are a hit-the-ground-running bunch of doers who really like <strong>actionable items</strong> and <strong>clear instructions</strong> as well as <strong>accountability</strong> and <strong>deliverables</strong>. Oh and throw in some <strong>metrics</strong> and a <strong>post-mortem</strong> so we can iterate, please. This makes us <em>very</em> challenging for outsiders to work with, especially when trying to engage a sizable group in open process activities. Turns out we’ll ask a lot of questions to clarify instructions, search high and low for actionable items, and demand deliverables. We’ll interrupt process, we’ll doubt the value of the process, and we’ll assume even before attempting that it is too open-ended to be of value or to generate the tangible items we’re craving as the proof our time was well spent.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If we go too far down that path in this unconference style of meetup, we will lose out tremendously on letting ourselves be changed and engaged by each other.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, asking each other “is this making sense to you?” or “are we doing it right?”,  that uncertainty IS a big part of process. Asking each other questions, being confused together, not knowing what’s coming next <strong>together </strong>is a form of bonding.</p>
<p>Bonding – which I shall refer to from now on as friendship – typically strengthens over equal parts of time spent together + common interests + shared experience. Sometimes you can fast forward a friendship by just overloading one of those areas. Having a particularly intense experience with someone (eg: riding a roller coaster), spending a lot of consecutive time (eg: traveling together), and connecting intensely on a common interest (eg: hacking) are all examples of ways to ramp up the development of a strong bond with another human. When attending a Summit we are provided a multitude of opportunities to have many of those three with a variety of Mozillians we normally might not interact with, and sometimes with ones we do – deepening connections is the ‘bonus’ to the work we get done when we assemble en masse. My most remembered experiences at Summits, All-Hands’, Moz Camp, and other larger gatherings with Mozillians have always been about the micro interactions which are not  part of the schedule. Walking to dinner, sitting on the bus, playing Rock Band – those are opportunities to look at the person or people around you and to try to make sure you’re getting to know even a little bit about them.</p>
<p>In the very earliest part of our process for the weekend of discovery and digging into the meat of what should drive our Summit planning a question came up about whether we could affect the decision to have the Summit in 3 different geo-locations.  Just that one little detail was something many people were tripping over and wanted to discuss and it was clear our dive into the weekend’s process would be held up until there were <em>answers</em>. What ended up happening was Mardi explained how logistically they had looked at previous Summits & large gatherings and had determined that 600 people seemed to be the largest number of Mozillians in one place where there still could be a ‘cozy’ feeling that allows for the kind of bonding previously mentioned.  Once Mardi said this, I was changed.  I, too, had wondered about the dispersal but now it made sense to me that the importance of connection between Mozillians had been placed before the need to put us all in one location and  I appreciated getting this new perspective on what the process had accomplished already.</p>
<p>Mitchell then spoke about how sometimes we get hung up on comparing one thing to another and are quite vocal if we find it wanting.  It’s important for us to have this gathering, this alignment exercise for the project as a whole, and if we don’t want to call it a ‘Summit’ because it’s not everyone in one physical space then call it something else in your head.  I found her point to be very inspiring and concluded that it’s important to go to this 2013 gathering – at whichever location – and <strong>BE</strong> there.  Do not waste time comparing it to other events, attend the event you’re at and reflect later. For me, this was when I knew I could trust the weekend’s activities would lead to great things and more changes of my tightly held beliefs I came into the weekend with.  There will be more about this in future posts.</p>
<p>Thanks, Process.</p>

--not recently though-- and I've also been lightly involved in the
FOSDEM Python room this year.</p>
<p>There's one thing that frustrated me a lot in this exercise:
the inability to reach out specific people in the Python community.</p>
<p>I was never really able to answer questions like this:</p>
<ul class=\"simple\">
<li>I want a list of all Numpy specialists in Europe that are willing to
give a talk.</li>
<li>I want a list of all women developers that are willing to give
a talk about Python in Europe.</li>
<li>I want a list of experts that can help me selecting the
right talks for a given topic.</li>
<li>I want to know who loves Python in Burgundy!</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course you can shout out on a blog, on twitter, or try to reach
the right people through your network.</p>
<p>For the second question --reaching out women-- I've learnt too
late that I should've worked with the PyLadies on this, or
even the Ada initiative.</p>
<p>But this is too much work. I just want to reach out the right
<strong>people</strong> without having to go through a lot of intermediates.</p>
<p>I want to have a single place on the internets where Bob and
Sarah can add a list of topics they are involved into, tell if
they are interested in giving talks, in what area of the world,
etc.</p>
<p>I think it can't be Lanyard because they would probably not
let me query their users database with specific queries
like the ones I mentioned. It can't be Linkedin for the same
reasons.</p>
<p>I was pointed to some directories that looked a bit like
what I envisioned, but they were local directories that just
listed Python people without giving all the info I
am looking for.</p>
<p>So what I think the Python community is missing is a
<strong>worldwide Pythoneers directory</strong> that is not affiliated to any
group, organization, company or foundation -- were users can
fill out a profile with their interests in Python.</p>
<p>So I am going to try to build that tool during the
next Europython in Italy.</p>
<p>The features I want are pretty simple:</p>
<ul class=\"simple\">
<li>the ability to connect with your github or bitbucket
account.</li>
<li>the ability to build a page about you, a little bit
like about.me, but with predefined, <em>optional</em> fields
like your gender, your location, the projects you are
involved into, and so on.</li>
<li>the ability for someone to query & reach out
a specific group of people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this raises some issues, like the fact that
it could be used by commercial companies to send some
unsollicited e-mails like recruiting e-mails, or
simple spams. But people are already used to deal with
this as soon as they have a public life.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this, reach me out or add a
comment. The goal will be to talk about the idea, refine it,
and have a first version running by the end of Europython,
and see if we get somewhere.</p>" nil nil "f43d17729e1af7c059e07e5395e39ccc") (96 (20931 19014 920780) "http://mozakai.blogspot.com/2013/06/what-asmjs-is-and-what-asmjs-isnt.html" "Alon Zakai: What asm.js is and what asm.js isn't" "azakai" "Thu, 20 Jun 2013 17:34:38 +0000" "This is going to be a bit long, so <b>tl;dr</b> asm.js is a  formalization of a pattern of JavaScript that has been developing in a  natural way over years. It isn't a new VM or a new JIT or anything like that.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://asmjs.org/\">asm.js</a> is a <b>subset of JavaScript</b>, defined with the goal of being <b>easily  optimizable</b> and used primarily as a <b>compiler target</b> from languages like  C and C++. I've seen some recent online discussions where people appear  to misunderstand what those things mean, which motivated me to write this post, where I'll give my perspective on asm.js together with some context and history.<br /><br />The first thing worth mentioning here is that  compiling into JavaScript is nothing new. It's been done since at least  <b>2006</b> with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/\">Google Web Toolkit</a> (GWT) which can compile Java into  JavaScript (GWT also does a lot more, it's a complete toolkit for  writing complex clientside apps, but I'll focus on the compiler part of  it). Many other compilers from various languages to JavaScript have  shown up since then, for both existing languages like C++ and C#, to new  languages like CoffeeScript, TypeScript and Dart.<br /><br />Compiled code  (that is, JavaScript that is the output of a compiler) can look odd.  It's often not in a form that we would be likely to write by hand. And  each compiler has a particular pattern or style of code that it emits:  For example, a compiler can translate classes in one language into  JavaScript classes using prototypal inheritance (which might look a little more like \"typical\" JS), or it can implement  those classes with function calls without inheritance (passing  \"this\" manually; this might look a little less \"typical\"), etc. Each compiler has a way in which it works, and  that gives it a particular pattern of output.<br /><br />Different patterns  of JavaScript can run at different speeds in different engines. This is  obvious of course. On one specific benchmark a JS engine can be faster than another, but in general no JS engine is \"the fastest\", because different  benchmarks can test different things - use of classes, garbage  collection, integer math, etc. When comparing JS engines, one can be better on  one of those aspects and slower on another, because optimizing for them can be quite separate. Look at the individual  parts of benchmarks on <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/\">AWFY</a> for example (click \"breakdown\"), and you'll see that.<br /><br />The  same is true for compiled code: different JS engines can be faster or  slower on particular patterns of compiled code. For example, it was  recently noticed that <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=870627\">Chrome is sometimes much faster than Firefox on GWT-generated code</a>; as you can see in the bug there, recent  work has narrowed the gap. There is nothing odd about that: one JS  engine was faster than another on a particular pattern, and work was  done to catch up. This is how things work.<br /><br />Aside from Java, which  GWT compiles, another important language is C++. There have been at  least two compilers from C++ to JavaScript in existence over the last  few years, <a href=\"http://emscripten.org/\">Emscripten</a> and <a href=\"http://mandreel.com/\">Mandreel</a>. They are separate  projects and quite different in many ways - for example, Emscripten is  open source and targets just JavaScript, while Mandreel is closed source  and can target other things as well like Flash - but over a few years  they converged on basically the same pattern of JavaScript for compiled  C++ code. That pattern involves using a <b>singleton typed array</b> to  represent memory, and <b>bitwise operations</b> (<span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">|0</span>, etc.) to get values to  behave like C++ integers (the JavaScript language only has doubles).<br /><br />We might say that Emscripten and Mandreel \"discovered\" a useful pattern of JavaScript, where \"discovered\" means the same as when Crockford discovered JSON. Of course typed arrays, bitwise ops and JavaScript Object Notation syntax all existed earlier, but noticing particular ways in which they can be especially useful is significant. Today it feels very natural to use JSON as a data interchange format - it almost feels like it was originally designed to be used in that manner, even though of course it was not - and likewise, if you are writing a compiler from C++ to JavaScript, it is natural to use <span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">|0</span> and a singleton typed array to do so.<br /><br />Luckily for the Emscripten/Mandreel pattern, that type of code benefits  from many years of work that went into JavaScript engines. For example,  they are all very good at optimizing code whose types do not change, and  the Emscripten/Mandreel pattern generates code that is implicitly  statically typed, since it originated as statically typed C++, so in  fact types should not change. Likewise, the bitwise operators that are  important in the Emscripten/Mandreel pattern appeared in crypto tests in major benchmarks like SunSpider, so they  are already well-optimized for.<br /><br />In other words, the  Emscripten/Mandreel pattern of code could be quite fast due to it  focusing on things that JS engines <b>already</b> did well. This isn't a  coincidence of course, as both Emscripten and Mandreel tested in  browsers and decided to generate code that ran as quickly as possible. Then, as the output of these compilers was increasingly  used on the web, browsers started to optimize for them in more specific  ways. Google added a benchmark of Mandreel code to the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/octane/benchmark\">Octane benchmark</a>  (the successor to the popular V8 benchmark), and both Chrome and Firefox  have optimized for both Mandreel and Emscripten for some time now (as a quick search in their bug trackers can show). So  the Emscripten/Mandreel pattern became yet another pattern of JavaScript  that JavaScript engines optimize for, alongside all the others which  are represented in the familiar benchmarks: SunSpider, Octane, Kraken,  etc. This was all a very natural process.<br /><br />Here is where we get to  asm.js. While Emscripten/Mandreel code can run quickly, there was still  some gap between it and native code. The gap was not huge - in many  cases it ran just <b>3x</b> slower than native code, which is pretty close to,  say, Java - but still problematic in some cases (for example,  high-performances games). So Mozilla began a research project to  investigate ways to narrow that gap. <a href=\"https://github.com/dherman/asm.js/\">Developed in the open</a>, asm.js started to <b>formally define</b> the Emscripten/Mandreel  pattern as a type system. Formalizing it made us think about all the  corner cases, and we found various places in Emscripten/Mandreel code  where types could change at runtime, which is contrary to the goal of  the pattern, and can make things slower. asm.js's goal was to get rid of  all those pitfalls.<br /><br />The <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/mloc_emscripten_talk/#/27\">first set of benchmark results</a> was promising - execution close to <b>2x</b> slower than native, even  on larger benchmarks. Achieving that speedup in Firefox took just 1  engineer only 3 months, since it <b>doesn't</b> require a new VM or a new JIT,  it only required adding some additional optimizations to Firefox's  existing JS engine. Soon after, Google showed very large speedups on asm.js code as well, as noted in the IO keynote and as you can <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/#machine=11&view=breakdown&suite=asmjs-apps\">see on AWFY</a>. (In fact, over the last few days there have been several speedups noticeable there on both browsers - these  improvements are happening as we speak!) Again, these large speedups in  two browsers were achieved quickly because no new VM or JIT was written,  just additional optimizations to <b>existing</b> JS VMs. So it would be  incorrect to say that asm.js is a \"new VM\".<br /><br />I've also seen people  say that asm.js is a new \"web technology\". Loosely speaking, I suppose  we could use that term, but only if we understand that if we say \"asm.js  is a web technology\" then that is totally different from when we say  \"WebGL is a web technology\". Something like WebGL is in fact what we  normally call a \"web technology\" - it was standardized, and browsers  need to decide to support it and then do work to implement it. asm.js,  on the other hand, is a certain <b>pattern</b> of  compiled code in JavaScript, which is already standardized and supported. asm.js, just like GWT's output pattern, does not need to  be standardized, nor do browsers need to \"support\" it, nor to  standardize whatever optimizations they perform for it. Browsers already  support JavaScript and compete on JavaScript speed, so asm.js, GWT  output, CoffeeScript output, etc., all work in them and are optimized to  varying degrees.<br /><br />Regarding the term \"support\": As before, I  suppose we can loosely talk about browsers \"supporting\" asm.js, but we  need to be sure what we mean. On the one hand, when we talk about WebGL  then it is clear what we mean when we say something like \"IE10 does not  support WebGL\". But if we say \"a browser supports asm.js\", we intend  something very different - I guess people using that phrase mean  something like \"a browser that spent some time to optimize for asm.js\".  But I don't see people saying \"a browser supports GWT output\", so I  suspect that using the term \"support\" comes from the mistaken notion  that asm.js is something more than a pattern of JavaScript, which is not  the case.<br /><br />Why, then, do some people apparently still think  asm.js is anything more than a pattern of JavaScript? I can't be sure,  but here are some possibilities and clarifications to them:<br /><br /><b>1.</b> asm.js code basically defines a low-level VM, in a sense: There is a singleton array for \"memory\" and all the operations are on that. While true, it is also true for Emscripten and Mandreel output, and other compilers as well. So in some sense this is valid to say, but just in the general sense that we can implement VMs in JavaScript (or any Turing-complete language), which of course we can regardless of asm.js.<br /><br /><b>2.</b> Some of the initial speedups from  asm.js were surprisingly large, and it felt like a big jump from the  current speed of JavaScript, not an incremental step like things  normally progress. And big jumps often require something \"new\",  something large and standalone. But as I mentioned above, this was  actually a very gradual process. Relevant optimizations for Emscripten/Mandreel  code have taken years, writing SSA-optimizing JITs like CrankShaft and  IonMonkey have likewise taken years (there is overlap between these two statements, of course), and the speedups on asm.js code are  due to those long-term projects being able to really shine on a code  pattern that is easy for them to optimize. In fact, many of the recent  optimizations to speed up asm.js code do not actually add new  optimizations directly, instead they change whether the browser decides  to fully optimize it - that is, they get the code to <b>actually reach</b> the  optimizing JIT (CrankShaft, IonMonkey, etc.). The power of those  optimizing JITs has been there for a while now, but sometimes heuristics  prevented it from being used.<br /><br /><b>3.</b> A related thing is that I sometimes see people say that asm.js code will be \"unusably slow\" on browsers that do not optimize for it in a special way (just today I saw such a comment on hacker news, for example). First of all this is just false: look at <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/#machine=11&view=breakdown&suite=asmjs-ubench\">these</a> <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/#machine=11&view=breakdown&suite=asmjs-apps\">benchmarks</a>, it is clear that on many of them Firefox and Chrome have essentially the same performance, and where there is a difference, it is noticeably decreasing. But aside from the fact that it is false, it is also disrespectful to the JavaScript VM engineers at Google, Microsoft and Apple: To say that asm.js code will be \"unusably slow\" on browsers other than Firefox implies that  those other VM devs can't match a level of performance that was shown to be possible by their peers. That is a ridiculous thing to say given how talented those devs are, which has been proven countless times.<br /><br />If someone says it will be \"unusably slow\" not because they <i>can't</i> reach the same speed but because they <i>won't</i>, then that looks obviously false. Why would any browser decide to not optimize for a type of JavaScript that is being used - including in high-profile things like <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">Epic Citadel</a> - and has relevant benchmarks? All browsers want to be fast on everything, this is a very competitive field, and we have already seen Google optimize for asm.js code as mentioned earlier in the IO keynote; there are also some <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Charles/Anders-Hejlsberg-Steve-Lucco-and-Luke-Hoban-Inside-TypeScript-09\">positive signs</a> from Microsoft as well.<br /><br /><b>4.</b> Another possible reason is that  the asm.js optimization module in Firefox is called OdinMonkey (mentioned for example in <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/luke/2013/03/21/asm-js-in-firefox-nightly/\">this blogpost</a>). SpiderMonkey, Firefox's JavaScript  engine, has called its JITs with Monkey-related names: TraceMonkey, JaegerMonkey and  IonMonkey (although, baseline is a new JIT that received no Monkey name,  so there is definitely no consistency here). So perhaps OdinMonkey sounds like  it could be a new JIT, which seems to imply that asm.js optimizations  require a new JIT. But as mentioned in that blogpost, OdinMonkey is <b>not</b> a  new JIT, instead it is a module that sits alongside the rest of the  parts of the JavaScript engine. What OdinMonkey does is detect the  presence of asm.js code, take the parse tree that the normal parser  emitted, type check the parse tree, and then send that information into  the existing IonMonkey optimizing compiler. All the code optimization  and code generation of IonMonkey are still being used, no new JIT for  asm.js was written. That's why, as mentioned before, writing OdinMonkey only took one engineer 3 month's work (while also working on the spec). Writing a new JIT would take much more  time and effort!<br /><br /><b>5.</b> Also possibly related is the fact that  OdinMonkey uses the \"use asm\" hint to decide to type check the code.  This is indeed a bit odd, and feels wrong to some people. I certainly  understand that feeling, in fact when working on the design of asm.js I  argued against it. The alternative would be to do some heuristic check:  Does this block of code not contain anything impossible in asm.js (no  throw statements, for example), and does it contain a singleton typed  array, etc.? If so, then start to type check in OdinMonkey. This could  achieve practically the same result in my opinion. It does, however,  have some downsides - heuristics are sometimes wrong and often add overhead, and really this optimization won't \"luckily work\" on  random code, instead it will be expected and intended by a person using a  C++ to JS compiler, so why not have them note that intention - which are strong arguments for using an explicit hint.<br /><br />The important thing is that \"use asm\" does not affect JS semantics (if it does in some case - and new optimizations often do cause bugs in odd corner cases - then that must be fixed just like any other correctness bug). That means that JavaScript engines can ignore it, and if it is ultimately determined to be useless by JS engines then we can just stop emitting it.<br /><br /><b>6. </b>asm.js has a spec, and defines a type  system. That seems much more \"formal\" than, say, the output pattern of  GWT, and furthermore things that <b>do</b> have specs are generally things  like IndexedDB and WebGL, that is, web technologies that need to be  standardized and so forth. I think this implies to some people that  asm.js is more like WebGL than just a pattern of JavaScript. But not  everything with a spec has it for standardization purposes. As mentioned  before, one reason for writing a spec and type system for asm.js was to  really force us to think about every detail, in order to get rid of all  the places where types can change, and other stuff that prevents  optimizations. There are 4 other reasons that IMO justified the  effort to write a spec:<br /><br />* Having a spec makes it  easy to communicate things to other people. As I mentioned before, GWT  output often used to run (and maybe still does) faster in Chrome than  Firefox, and I am not really sure why (probably multiple reasons). GWT  and Chrome are two projects from the same company, so it would not be  surprising if their devs talk to each other privately, and there would  be nothing wrong with it if they did. Emscripten and Firefox are, like  GWT and Chromium, two open source projects primarily developed by a  single browser vendor, so there is sort of a parallel situation here. To avoid the downsides of private discussions, we felt that writing a spec for asm.js would give us the benefit of being  able to say \"<b>this (with all the technical details) is why this code  runs fast in Firefox</b>.\" That means that if other browser vendors want to  run that code quickly, then they have all the docs they need in order to  do so, and on the other side of things, if other compilers like  Mandreel want to benefit from those speedups, then once more they have  all the information they need as well. Writing a spec (and doing so in the open) makes things public and  transparent.<br /><br />* Having a type system opens up the possibility to  do <b>ahead of time (AOT)</b> compilation in a reasonable way. Note that AOT  should have already been possible in the output patterns for Emscripten  and Mandreel (remember, they are generated from C++, that is AOTed), but  actually wasn't because of the few places where types could in fact  change. Assuming we did things properly, asm.js should have no such  possible type changes anymore, so AOT is possible. And a type system  makes it not just possible but quite reasonable to actually do so in  practice.<br /><br />AOT can be very useful in reducing the overhead and risk of optimization heuristics. As mentioned before, in some cases code never even reaches the optimizing JIT due to heuristics not making the optimal decision, and furthermore, collecting the data for those heuristics (how long a function or loop executes, type info for variables, etc.) adds overhead (during a warmup phase before full optimization, and possibly later during deoptimization and recompilation). If code can be compiled in an AOT manner, we simply avoid those two problems: we optimize everything, and we do so immediately. (There is a potential downside, however, in that fully optimizing large amounts of code can take significant time; in Firefox this is partially mitigated by things like compilation using multiple cores, another possibility is to consider falling back to the baseline JIT for particularly slow-to-compile functions.)<br /><br />Because of these benefits of AOT compilation, it can avoid the \"stutter\" problem - where a game pauses or slows down briefly when new code is executed (like when a new level in the game is begun that uses some new mechanics or effects), due to some new code being detected as hot and then optimized, at the precise time when it is needed to be fast. Stutter can be quite problematic, as it tends to happen at the worst possible times - when something interesting happens - and I've often heard game devs be concerned about it. AOT compilation fully optimizes all the code ahead of time, so the stutter problem is avoided.<br /><br />A further benefit of AOT is that it gives predictable performance: we know that all the code will be fully optimized, so we can be reasonably confident of performance in a new benchmark we have never tested on, since we do not rely on heuristics to decide what to optimize and when. This has been shown repeatedly when AOT compilation in Firefox achieved good performance the very first time we ran it on a new codebase or benchmark, for example on <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">Epic Citadel</a>, <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/lua.vm.js/lua.vm.js.html\">a compiled Lua VM</a>, and others. In my JavaScript benchmarking experiences in the past, that has been rare.<br /><br />AOT therefore brings several benefits. But with all that said, it is an implementation detail, one possible approach among others. As JS engines continue to investigate ways to run this type of code even better, we will likely see more experimentation in this area.<br /><br />*  Last reason for writing the spec and type system: asm.js began as a  research project, and we might want to publish a paper about it at some  point. (This one is much less important than the other three, but since I wrote out the others, might as well be complete.)<br /><br />That sums up point 6, why asm.js has a spec and type system. Finally, two last possible reasons why people might mistakenly think asm.js is a new VM or something like that:<br /><br /><b>7. </b>Math.imul. Math.imul is something that came up during the design of asm.js, that did actually turn into a proposal for standardization (for ES6), and has been implemented in at least Firefox and Chrome so far. Some people seem to think that asm.js relies on Math.imul, which would imply that asm.js relies on new language features in JavaScript. While Math.imul is helpful, it is entirely optional. It makes only a tiny impact on benchmarks, and is super-easy to polyfill (which emscripten does). Perhaps it would have been simpler to not propose it and just use the polyfill code, to avoid any possible confusion. But Math.imul is so simple to define (multiply two 32-bit numbers properly, return the lower 32 bits), and is basically the only integer math operation that cannot be implemented in a natural way in JS (the remarkable thing is that all the others <b>do</b> have a natural way to be expressed, even though JavaScript does not have integer types!), so it just felt like a shame not to.<br /><br />It's important to stress that if Math.imul were opposed by the JavaScript community, it would of course not have been used by asm.js - asm.js is a subset of JavaScript, it can't use anything nonstandard. It goes without saying though that new things are being discussed for standardization in JavaScript all the time, and if there are things that could be useful for compiled C++ code, then such things are worth discussing in the JavaScript community and standards bodies.<br /><br /><b>8.</b> Finally, asm.js and Google's <a href=\"http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl/building-and-testing-portable-native-client\">portable native client</a> (PNaCl) share the goal of  enabling C++ code to run safely on the web at near-native speeds. So it  is perhaps not surprising that some people have written blogposts  comparing them. And aside from that shared goal, there are some other  similarities, like both utilizing LLVM in some manner. But to compare  them as if they were two competing <b>products</b> - that is, as if they  directly compete with each other, and one's success may be at the  other's detriment - is, I think, irrelevant. PNaCl (and PPAPI, the pepper plugin API on which it depends) is a proposed web  technology, something that needs to be standardized with support from  multiple vendors if it is to be part of the web, and asm.js on the other  hand is just a pattern of JavaScript, something that is already  supported in all modern browsers. asm.js code is being optimized for  right now, just like many patterns of JavaScript are, driven by the  browser speed race. So asm.js will continue to run faster over time,  <b>regardless</b> of what happens with other things like PNaCl: I don't see a  realistic scenario where PNaCl somehow makes browser vendors decide to  stop competing on JavaScript speed (other plugin technologies like Flash, Java, Silverlight, Unity, etc. did not).<br /><br />All of this has nothing to do  with how good PNaCl is. (Worth mentioning here that I consider it to be  an impressive feat of engineering, and I have a huge amount of respect  for the engineers working on it.) It is simply operating in a different  area. The JavaScript speed race is very important right now in the  browser market: When your browser runs something slower than another  browser, that's something that you are naturally motivated to improve.  This happens with benchmarks (we already saw big speedups on two  browsers on asm.js code), and it happens with things like the Epic  Citadel demo (it initially did not run at all in Chrome, but Google  quickly fixed things). This kind of stuff will continue to happen on the  web and drive asm.js performance, and as already mentioned, this is  regardless of what happens with PNaCl.<br /><br /><b>Are things really that simple?</b><br /><b><br /></b>I've  been saying that asm.js is just a pattern of JavaScript and nothing  more, and the speedups on it are part of the normal JavaScript speed  competition that leads browser vendors to optimize various patterns. But  actually things are more complicated than that. I would not  argue that <b>any</b> pattern should be optimized for, nor that it would be  ok for a vendor to specifically optimize based on hints for an <b>arbitrary</b> subset of JavaScript.<br /><br />To make my  point, consider the following extreme hypothetical example: A browser  vendor decides to optimize a little subset of JS that has a JS array for  memory, and stores either integers or strings into it. For example,<br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">function WTF(print) {<br />  'use WTF';<br />  var mem = [];<br />  function run(arg) {<br />    mem[20] = arg;<br />    var a = 100;<br />    mem[5] = a;<br />    a = 'hello';<br />    mem[11] = a;<br />    print(mem[5]);<br />    mem[5] = mem[11];<br />    a = arg;<br />    return a;<br />  }<br />  return run;<br />}</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\"><br /></span>Call  this <b>WTF.js</b>. So when 'use WTF' is present, the browser checks that  there is a singleton array called mem and so forth, and can then optimize the WTF.js code very well: mem is in a closure and does not escape, so we know its  identity statically; we also know it should be implemented  as a hash table because it likely has holes in its indexes; we know it  can contain only ints or strings so some custom super-specialized data structure might be useful here; etc. etc. Again, this is an example meant to be extreme and  ridiculous, but you can imagine that such a pattern might be useful as a  compilation target for some odd language.<br /><br />What is wrong with  WTF.js is that while it is JavaScript, it is a <b>terrible</b> kind of  JavaScript, in the following ways. In particular it violates basic principles of how current JavaScript  engines optimize: for starters, variables are given more than one type (both locals  and elements in mem). This is exactly what JS engine devs have been  telling us all <b>not</b> to do for years now. Also, this subset comes out of  nowhere - I can't think of anything like it, and when I tried to give it  a hypothetical justification in the previous paragraph, I had to really  reach. And there are obvious ways to make this more reasonable, for  example to use consecutive indexes from 0 in the \"mem\" array, so there are no holes - this is something else that JS engine devs have been telling us to do for a  very long time - and so forth. So WTF.js is in fact WTF-worthy.<br /><br />None  of that is the case with asm.js. As I detailed before, asm.js is the  latest development in a <b>natural</b> process that has been going on in the  JavaScript world for several years: Multiple compilers from C++ to JS  appeared spontaneously, later they converged on the subset of JS that  they target, and later JS engines optimized for that subset as it became more common on the web. While <span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">|0</span>  might look odd to you, it wasn't invented for asm.js. It was  \"discovered\" independently multiple times way before asm.js, found to be useful, and JS  engines optimized for it. This process was not directed by anyone; it  happened organically.<br /><br />These principles guided us while designing  early versions of asm.js: There were code patterns that were even easier  to optimize, but they were novel, sometimes bizarre, and most  importantly, they ran poorly without special optimizations for them,  that did not exist yet. When I felt that a proposed pattern was of that nature, I strongly opposed it. Emscripten and  Mandreel code already ran quite well; to design a new pattern that could  be much faster with special optimizations, but right now is  significantly slower without them, is a bad idea - it would feel unfair  and WTF-like.<br /><br />Therefore as we designed asm.js we tested on JS engines  without any special optimizations for it, primarily on Chrome and on  Firefox with the WIP optimizations turned off. asm.js is one output mode  in Emscripten, so we had a good basis for comparison: when we flip the  switch and go from the old Emscripten output pattern to asm.js, do things get  faster or slower? (Note btw that we lack something similar in the WTF.js  example from before, which is another problem with WTF.js.) What we saw was that (when we avoided the more  novel ideas I mentioned before, that were rejected), flipping the switch  from the old pattern to asm.js generally had little effect, sometimes  helping and sometimes hurting, but overall things stayed at much the same (quite good) level of performance JS engines already had. That made sense, because asm.js is very  close to the old pattern. (My guess is that the cases where it helped  were ones where asm.js's extra-careful avoidance of types changing at  runtime made a positive difference, and cases where it hurt were ones  where it happened to hit an unlucky case in the heuristics being used by  the JS engine.)<br /><br />A few months ago Emscripten's default code generation mode switched to asm.js. Like most significant changes it was discussed on the mailing list and irc, and I was happy to see that we did not get reports of slowdowns in other browsers as a result of the change, which is further evidence that we got that part right. In fact (aside from the usual miscellaneous bugs following any significant change in a large project), the main regression caused by that change was that we got reports of startup slowdowns in <i>Firefox</i> actually! (These were caused by AOT sometimes being sluggish, it was however very easy to get large speedups on it, following those bug reports.)<br /><br />Developing and shipping optimizations for something bizarre like WTF.js would be selfish, since it benefits one  vendor while arbitrarily, unexpectedly and needlessly harming perf in other vendor's  browsers. But none of that is the case with asm.js, which builds on a naturally-occurring pattern of  JavaScript (the Emscripten/Mandreel pattern, already optimized for by JS engines), was designed to not harm performance on other browsers compared to that already-existing pattern, and as benchmarks have shown on two browsers already, creates  opportunities for significant speedups on the web.<br /><br />" nil nil "d2d33ead1600eeaee1fbf5f80c698578") (95 (20931 1828 786402) "http://blog.kaibray.com/post/53435217912" "Kat Braybrooke: Creativity Is the Goal at Mozilla's #MakerParty" nil "Thu, 20 Jun 2013 12:49:00 +0000" "<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://webmaker.org/img/img-Party-feature.jpg\" width=\"450px\" /></p>

<p><img alt=\"Speaking at beyond tellerand\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5325/8900138988_eed229ccf9_z.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p></p><h3>Stage attire/clothing</h3><p></p>
<p>You will read a lot of things by clever people about “dressing better than the audience to give you a position of authority” and other – possibly true in some environments but so not in all – tips and tricks, but here are some things I found work very well for me:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Take off your lanyard/badge</strong> – it’ll reflect in the light of a stage and look odd on photos. Furthermore, if you use a lapel mic the lanyard will keep banging against it making clicking sounds or muffling your recording. I tend to put my name tag on my hip, threading the lanyard as a loop through the hoops of my trousers (I know, not possible when you wear a dress – just take the badge off before you get mic-ed up).</li><li><strong>Provide a space to clip the mic to</strong> – this is why button down shirts and polos are better than T-Shirts. You can clip the mic on them without having to thread the cable through the whole shirt, out of the neck and back to the middle of your chest where it should be</li><li><strong>Avoid stripes or loud patterns</strong> – they take away people’s attention to a degree but more importantly look terrible on photos and video as they cause a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern\">Moiré pattern effect</a>. A great example of that is the <a href=\"http://store-uk.hugoboss.com/Regular-Fit-cotton-polo-shirt-%27Bugnara-20%27/hbeu50243613,en_GB,pd.html&cgid=22300#!i%3D8%26color%3D453_Light-Pastel-Blue\">Hugo Boss site</a>, where it is impossible to see the texture of some shirts even in zoom because of this effect.</li><li><strong>Dark is good</strong> – you will probably sweat on stage, either because of the heat from the lamps or because you are nervous. Dark shirts don’t show sweat stains. Remember <a href=\"http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121120035045/grifball/images/c/cf/Developers.gif\">Developers, Developers, Developers</a>? The other way to deal with this is to wear a hoodie/jacket/blazer to cover up</li><li><strong>Keep a bit of space</strong> – very tight fitting clothing might show your perfect figure but it can also be distracting or in the case of largely built men intimidating. This is not a date, you are here to deliver some great content.</li><li><strong>Empty your pockets</strong> – you will need them to put the wireless transmitter of the lapel mic, it looks better to have no unsightly bulges and there won’t be the sound of clinking coins or keys in your pocket.</li><li><strong>Leave your mobile behind</strong> – a call or message during your talk can really change the flow of your talk. Furthermore, the buzz of the phone trying to find a connection will be audible on your microphone. An exception to this is of course when you want to show stuff on the phone or bring it up as a surprise. Even then turn it into flight mode. Some people also use the phone and alarms to tell them when there is only 10 minutes left in your talk. That could cause issues with the audio, too, so leave that to a friend in the audience or ask the organisers to have a clock on stage.</li></ul><p></p>
<p></p><h3>Audio equipment/microphones</h3><p></p>
<p>In some rooms you can make do without a microphone at all, but that is not always the case and you need to be a trained speaker to be loud but not detrimental to your vocal cords. Here are some things to be aware of when it comes to microphone technology:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Wireless lapel microphones</strong> – these are awesome and by far my favourite. As mentioned earlier, make sure they don’t end up next to anything that could cause click sounds, like buttons, tie-clips or your lanyard. Other than that, having those is the best thing you can get as they give you the most mobility on stage and are very simple to put on and take off. Try to get mic-ed up as soon as possible, as wiring them under your shirt is a bit intrusive and you might want to check your looks afterwards again (if that is important to you). Make sure they are muted when you are not on stage yet and that you turn them on just before. As my colleague Robert Nyman put it “You just don’t know what weird sounds your body is capable of until you get wired up”. Also you don’t want conversations you have with people before your talk be transmitted or recorded (well other than by the <span class=\"caps\">NSA</span>)</li><li><strong>Behind the ear microphones</strong> – these are a bit trickier, but yield very good sound results. Make sure that the mic doesn’t scratch against your beard stubbles, do not wear large ear-rings that might clink against them and take off your glasses, put the mic on and then put the glasses on top of them. I always found these microphones to be not really comfortable as they can cut into the back of your ear and limit your head movement a bit. Be aware of that.</li><li><strong>Handheld microphones</strong> – these seem intrusive as one of your hands needs always to be close to your mouth and effectively covering your chest – thus not allowing for large, inviting open gestures with both arms – but they can be great. If you are not too comfortable a speaker yet, they are something to hold onto on stage and keep your hands from randomly moving around or shaking. Also, they just work without people having to fiddle with your hair, glasses or other attire.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>As a strong rule of thumb – show love to the audio folk of the venue you speak at. They know their stuff and it is up to them for you to be audible by the audience. Follow their advice and make their life easier and you’ll give a great talk.</p>
<p></p><h3>Available stage tech</h3><p></p>
<p>Last but not least, here are some things on technology available for you on stage.</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Bring your own power cables and adapters</strong> – not every venue or conference is equipped with all the things you need</li><li><strong>Do not expect audio or video playback to be available</strong> – many a time I saw speakers building up to “a great video” just to be forced to show a blank rectangle or something without sound</li><li><strong>You will be offline</strong> – just give up on the promise of connectivity on stage. A good speaker does not need it and there is nothing more discouraging than seeing someone who is there to inspire you about the awesomeness of cloud services struggling with the wireless crapping out</li><li><strong>Plan for low resolution</strong> – 1024*768 at 60hz is normally possible, higher, not so much. So plan your demos and slides to be readable and usable on that resolution</li><li><strong>Bring your own remote/clicker</strong> – these are awesome. First of all it means you will not be glued to and hidden behind your computer. Secondly you have something in your hand (see handheld microphone above for the benefits of that). Thirdly they have laser pointers which is great to get rid of stray cats that may enter the stage</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Long time no see! I’ve been busy outside the blog-sphere and I’ve got some news to share. First of all, I upgraded my Firefox Add-on to version 0.1.7. So here is the link:</p>

<p>All in all, the important addition is that <strong>you can now use the hotkey Control+Y</strong> instead of pushing the button on the toolbar. Plus, I think it now has no other issues for most new versions of Firefox. I need to point out that I get most of the help from the SDK’s documentation which is great, but, to anyone interested, don’t hesitate to contribute to its content! Restartless add-ons rule!</p>

Jon Ippolito from the University of Maine wrote up <a href=\"http://www.blog.still-water.net/2013/05/the-ex-files-how-long-will-our-software-last/\">a great summary of who was there and what we discussed</a>, so I won't go into those details and leave you with his words on that.<br />
<br />
Instead, I'll do multiple short posts on my impressions and thoughts of the event and the subject, probably over the next few weeks.<br />
<br />
The attendance consistent mostly of people from the existing software preservation community in the US, the majority of those people knew (of) each other already, apparently. In addition, we had some people from the software creation community - Microsoft's (sole) archivist probably belongs to both the preservation and software communities, then we had a guy from GitHub, and finally, <a href=\"https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/ottodv/\">Otto</a> and me from Mozilla.<br />
<br />
One thing that I learned with regard to the preservation community is that there are basically three types of projects they operate: museums, archives, and libraries.<br />
<br />
Museums only collect a small collection of large milestones in history, but try to get as much on those as possible so they can build up a great exhibit for the public to learn about our and their past.<br />
Archives build up large collections of items with the main intent of preserving them as ideally as possible and usually without any intent to provide them to the public, the items are only available to sporadic researchers. There may be metadata collected on the items that may be available to a larger public, though.<br />
Libraries are somewhat in between: They build up larger collections of items and try to preserve them, but with the intent of some public to have regular access to them, often in a very controlled manner, e.g. via reading rooms.<br />
<br />
On this software preservation summit, we had a number of representatives of all three kinds of projects: Museums such as the Computer History Museum, the Museum of Modern Art or the MIT Museum, archives such as Microsoft's, NIST's NSRL (National Software Reference Library - yes, \"Library\" is a bit of a misnomer there) or the Internet Archive, and libraries such as the Astrophysics Source Code Library, university libraries or, of course, the Library of Congress.<br />
<br />
In terms of software preservation, we found that those different organizations and those doing different kinds of collections, can not just learn from each other, they can also help each other: Not every one of them wants every piece of software coming in, depending on what exactly they collect, so it may make sense to forward some pieces to other projects.<br />
<br />
It was interesting for us as outsiders to the preservation community to see what those people are doing and how they are organized. In future posts, I'll get more into how and where we as software producers can work with them." nil nil "86befb4b7ea05a3dba0546f1551832af") (89 (20930 47210 103405) "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/InPursuitOfMysteries/Mozilla/~3/bTXs7Na1QdE/" "Al Billings: Cal's Dreambox" nil "Wed, 19 Jun 2013 22:56:09 +0000" "<p>A few weeks ago, it was announced that there was now a 3D printing vending machine over at UC, Berkeley (aka \"Cal\") now. This is the creation of <a href=\"http://3dreambox.com/\">Dreambox</a>, some startup or somesuch doing 3D printing vending machines. Without a lot of data, I sent my trusty minion (I mean \"friend\"), <a href=\"http://zedlopez.com/\">Zed Lopez</a>, over to take a look at it for me. He took a few photos with his phone and I put them up as a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157634077943904/\">flickr set</a>.</p>

<p>While I'm happy to see more exposure to 3D printing for the public, this whole thing seems like a bit of a bad idea. Printers like this that print in plastic are notoriously finicky things, with prints often coming out badly if conditions aren't right or if the printer is simply not maintained and cleaned well. I don't know how an unattended Replicator 1 sitting in a box is going to do well with printing materials on a reliably basis. I certainly wouldn't want to own this Dreambox and have to maintain it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>There is some hope that the machine will be upgraded or better though. I got a note from Dreambox this morning (where I had made an account) mentioning that the whole machine was going offline at the end of this week while they upgraded it. I assume they are going to make some changes to make it more reliably, maybe upgrading the printer to a new model.</p>
<p>If anyone makes any prints on this machine, I'd love to hear more about how the process was for you as a normal user.</p>

That became the basis of a <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/firefox-developer-tool-features-for-firefox-23/\">post</a> on <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/\">Hacks</a> describing the features in that release. If learning to use advanced search features in Bugzilla doesn’t sound like your kind of thing, don’t worry, you don’t have to read it!</p>
<p>This is how to create that list of bugs using Bugzilla, the Page Inspector in Firefox Developer Tools and maybe a bit of Scratchpad to fix the styling.</p>
<p>Since we have a lot of components in Firefox Developer Tools land, I’m going to use the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi?query_format=advanced\">Bugzilla Search</a> interface rather than the more convenient <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=quicksearch.html\">Quicksearch API</a>. You can certainly use that, but for this job, I think the Search screen is a bit easier.</p>
<p>First, setup your components. Your lists should look like this:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://robcee.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-19-at-2.55.58-PM.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-06-19 at 2.55.58 PM\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-184\" height=\"172\" src=\"http://robcee.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-19-at-2.55.58-PM.png\" width=\"1130\" /></a>Note that I’ve selected RESOLVED, VERIFIED and CLOSED for my Status and FIXED for my resolution.</p>
<p>Next, click the Search by History option and enter the date range between this merge and the last. In this case, May 13th to June 24th.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://robcee.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-19-at-2.58.37-PM.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-06-19 at 2.58.37 PM\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-185\" height=\"155\" src=\"http://robcee.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-19-at-2.58.37-PM.png\" width=\"595\" /></a>Now you should be able to hit the Search button at the bottom of the page and get back a list of bugs. Sweet!</p>
<p>If you want to grab the list to plop into a blog post or Your Publishing Venue of Choice, you can open up the Page Inspector on this page (right click, Inspect Element, navigate the breadcrumbs until you find the table element) and then right clicking the element and picking “copy outer html”. This’ll copy the entire page fragment onto your clipboard for pasting into your editor.</p>
<p>You might want to select a different set of columns first. I just use Bug ID and Summary.</p>
<p>If you want to add or change the existing styling on the table rows, you can open a Scratchpad or Console and do something like:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: javascript; gutter: false\">[].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll(\"tr\"),
(row) => row.removeAttribute(\"class\"));</pre>
<p>… and again for the TD elements.</p>" nil nil "be5fde41764463a20fc04e1ad872aad7") (87 (20930 47210 102033) "https://brendaneich.com/2013/06/the-cookie-clearinghouse/" "Brendan Eich: The Cookie Clearinghouse" "Brendan Eich" "Wed, 19 Jun 2013 18:18:36 +0000" "<p>As you may recall from <a href=\"https://brendaneich.com/2013/05/c-is-for-cookie/\">almost six weeks ago</a>, we held the Safari-like <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=818340\">third-party cookie patch</a>, which blocks cookies set for domains you have not visited according to your browser’s cookie database, from progressing to <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/beta/\">Firefox Beta</a>, because of two problems:</p>
<blockquote cite=\"https://brendaneich.com/2013/05/c-is-for-cookie/\">
<p><b>False positives</b>. For example, say you visit a site named <code>foo.com</code>, which embeds cookie-setting content from a site named <code>foocdn.com</code>. With the patch, Firefox sets cookies from <code>foo.com</code> because you visited it, yet blocks cookies from <code>foocdn.com</code> because you never visited <code>foocdn.com</code> directly, even though there is actually just one company behind both sites.</p>
<p><b>False negatives</b>. Meanwhile, in the other direction, just because you visit a site once does not mean you are ok with it tracking you all over the Internet on unrelated sites, forever more. Suppose you click on an ad by accident, for example. Or a site you trust directly starts setting <a href=\"http://blog.sidstamm.com/2013/03/what-ever-happened-to-second-party.html\">third-party cookies</a> you do not want.</p>
<p>Our challenge is to find a way to address these sorts of cases. We are looking for more granularity than deciding automatically and exclusively based upon whether you visit a site or not, although that is often a good place to start the decision process. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The logic driving us along the path to a better default third-party cookie policy looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li> We want a third-party cookie policy that better protects privacy and encourages transparency.
</li><li> Naive visited-based blocking results in significant false negative and false positive errors.
</li><li> We need an exception management mechanism to refine the visited-based blocking verdicts.
</li><li> This exception mechanism cannot rely solely on the user in the loop, managing exceptions by hand. (When Safari users run into a false positive, they are advised to disable the block, and apparently many do so, permanently.)
</li><li> The only credible alternative is a centralized block-list (to cure false negatives) and allow-list (for false positives) service.
</li></ol>
<p>I’m very pleased that <a href=\"https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/aleecia-mcdonald\">Aleecia McDonald</a> of the <a href=\"https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/\">Center for Internet and Society</a> at Stanford has <a href=\"http://cch.law.stanford.edu/press/\">launched</a> just such a list-based exception mechanism, the <a href=\"http://cch.law.stanford.edu\">Cookie Clearinghouse</a> (CCH).</p>
<p>Today Mozilla is committing to work with Aleecia and the <a href=\"http://cch.law.stanford.edu/advisory-board/\">CCH Advisory Board</a>, whose members include <a href=\"http://www.opera.com/\">Opera Software</a>, to develop the CCH so that browsers can use its lists to manage exceptions to a visited-based third-party cookie block.</p>
<p>The CCH proposal is at an early stage, so we crave feedback. This means we will hold the visited-based cookie-blocking patch in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/aurora/\">Firefox Aurora</a> while we bring up CCH and its Firefox integration, and test them.</p>
<p>Of course, browsers would cache the block- and allow-lists, just as we do for <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/phishing-protection/\">safe browsing</a>. I won’t try to anticipate or restate details here, since we’re just starting. Please see the <a href=\"http://cch.law.stanford.edu\">CCH</a> site for the latest.</p>
<p>We are planning a public “brown bag” event for July 2nd at Mozilla to provide an update on where things stand and to gather feedback. I’ll update this post with details as they become available, but I wanted to share the date ASAP.</p>

<p><em>[This is an experiment in publishing a doc piece by piece as blog entries.
Please refer to the</em> <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"http://dtor.com/halfire/2013/06/19/../../../2012/01/26/releng_and_git_project.html#releng-and-git-project\"><em>main page</em></a> <em>for additional context.]</em></p>
<p>Mozilla, like most operations, has the Repositories of Record (RoR) set
to only allow “fast forward” updates when new code is landed. In order
to fast forward merge, the tip of the destination repository (RoR) must
be an ancestor of the commit being pushed from the source repository. In
the discussion below, it will be useful to say if a repository is
“ahead”, “behind”, or “equal” to another. These states are defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class=\"simple\">
<li>If the tip of the two repositories are the same reference, then
the two repositories are said to be <em>equal</em> (‘<strong>e</strong>‘ in table
below)</li>
<li>Else if the tip of the upstream repository is a ancestor of the
tip of the destination repository, the upstream is defined to be
<em>behind</em> (‘<strong>B</strong>‘ in table below) the source repository</li>
<li>Otherwise, the upstream repository is <em>ahead</em> (‘<strong>A</strong>‘ in table
below) of the source repository.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Landing a change in the normal (2 repository case: RoR and lander’s
repository), the process is logically (assuming no network issues):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class=\"arabic\">
<li><p class=\"first\">Make sure lander’s repository is equivalent to RoR (start with
equality)</p>
</li>
<li><p class=\"first\">Apply the changes (RoR is now “Behind” the local repository)</p>
</li>
<li><dl class=\"first docutils\">
<dt>Push the changes to the RoR</dt>
<dd><ul class=\"first last\">
<li><p class=\"first\">if the push succeeds, then stop. (equality restored)</p>
</li>
<li><p class=\"first\">if the push fails, simultaneous landings were being attempted,
and you lost the race.</p>
<p>When simultaneous landings are attempted, only one will succeed,
and the others will need to repeat the landing attempt. The
RoR is now “Ahead” of the local repository, and the new
upstream changes will need to be incorporated, logically as:</p>
<ol class=\"loweralpha simple\">
<li>Remove the local changes (“patch -R”, “git stash”, “hg
import”, etc.).</li>
<li>Pull the changes from RoR (will apply cleanly, equality restored)</li>
<li>Continue from step 2 above</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When an authorized committer wants to land a change set on an
hg RoR from git, there are three repositories involved. These are the
<em>RoR</em>, the <em>git</em> repository the lander is working in, and internal
<em>hggit</em> used for translation. The sections below describe how this
affects the normal case above.</p>
<div class=\"section\" id=\"land-from-git-happy-path\">
<h4>Land from git – Happy Path</h4>
<p>On the happy path (no commit collisions, no network issues), the steps
are identical to the normal path above. The git commands executed by the
lander are set by the tool chain to perform any additional operations
needed.</p>
</div>
<div class=\"section\" id=\"land-from-git-commit-collision\">
<h4>Land from git – Commit Collision</h4>
<p>Occasionally, multiple people will try to land commits simultaneously,
and a commit collision will occur (steps 3a, 3b, & 3c above). As long as the
collision is noticed and dealt with before addition changes are
committed to the git repository, the tooling will unapply the change to
the internal hggit repository.</p>
</div>
<div class=\"section\" id=\"land-from-git-sad-path\">
<h4>Land from git – Sad Path</h4>
<p>In real life, network connections fail, power outages occur, and other
gremlins create the need to deal with “sad paths”. The following
sections are only needed when we’re neither on the happy path nor
experiencing a normal commit collision.</p>
<p>Because these cases cover every possible case of disaster recovery, it
can appear more complex than it is. While there are multiple (6)
different sad paths, only one will be in play for a given repository.
And the maximum number of operations to recover is only three (3).  The
relationship between each pair of repositories determines the correct
actions to take to restore the repositories to a known, consistent
state. The static case is simply:</p>
<p class=\"graphviz\">
<img alt=\"Simplistic Recovery State Diagram\" src=\"http://dtor.com/halfire/2013/06/19/../../../_images/graphviz-a48b07aa80f7c05c03cd5914ba00cf9fb0cdbc08.png\" />
</p>
<p class=\"caption\">Simplistic Recovery State Diagram</p>
<div class=\"admonition note\">
<p class=\"first admonition-title\">Note</p>
<ol class=\"last arabic simple\">
<li>The simplistic diagram assumes no changes to RoR during the
duration of the recovery (not a valid assumption for real
life). See the text for information on dealing with the
changes.</li>
<li>States “BB” & “BA” are not shown, as they represent invalid
states that may require restoring portions of the system
from backup before proceeding.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>In reality, it is impractical to guarantee the RoR is static during
recovery steps. That can be dealt with by applying the process described
in the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"http://dtor.com/halfire/2013/06/19/inter_repo_actions.html#diagram-1\">flowchart to restore equality</a> and using the tables below to
locate the actions.</p>
<p>The primary goal is to ensure correctness based on the RoR. The
secondary goal is to make the interim repository as invisible as possible.</p>

"michal berman" "Wed, 19 Jun 2013 15:02:01 +0000" "<p>As an executive coach, I’ve seen people’s careers transformed by coaching. Many of the world's most admired companies, from Google to Goldman Sachs, invest in coaching, and annual spending on coaching in the U.S. is estimated at roughly $1 billion, <a href=\"http://hbr.org/2009/01/what-can-coaches-do-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"HBR what is coaching\">according to Harvard Business Review</a>. Yet I find that many people still don’t know what executive coaching is, how it works and what it can do for them. Here’s some insight.</p>
<p><strong>Coaching defined</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, coaching is personal training that helps professionals reach their goals, no matter where they are in the workforce – entry-level, CEO and everything in between. Much like a personal trainer works your body, an executive coach works your mind, helping you develop the mental strength, emotional intelligence and instinctive ability to problem solve and relate with others in the workplace. </p>
<p>Coaching uses a proven methodology of inquiry, called <a href=\"http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&cad=rja&ved=0CFQQFjAH&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecoaches.com%2Fresources%2Ftoolkit%2Fpdfs%2F31-Powerful-Questions.pdf&ei=JtrAUdLbF8uvqwGC1YGIBw&usg=AFQjCNF7kKAcduSBkeSZUP4AtbInroJSRw&sig2=ja3Il-8ahylIA8Q3LpRrFA&bvm=bv.48175248,d.aWM\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"powerful questions\">powerful questions</a>, that’s been around for decades. The process is designed to leverage your unique personality and strengths, and it does so not by giving you the answers but by helping you learn to ask and answer the right questions on your own throughout your career’s myriad challenges.</p>
<p>The profession is governed by the <a href=\"http://www.coachfederation.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ICF\">International Coach Federation</a> and has several internationally renowned schools, such as the one I attended: <a href=\"http://www.thecoaches.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CTI\">The Coaches Training Institute</a>, the largest and oldest coach training school in the world. </p>
<p>What can an executive coach do for you?</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Be a trusted sounding board.</strong></p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I have found that most leaders thrive when they have a trusted guide who has walked in their shoes and is a truly unbiased source of feedback. Very few career and workplace challenges are brand new; a person’s experience or lack thereof is usually the variable. A good coach has no skin in the game other than your success as you’ve defined it, and will help you anticipate, problem-solve and build internal partnerships with the skill of a seasoned professional. </p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Support you with transitioning to a new role or career.</strong></p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">With most new roles come high expectations and unfamiliar territory, such as managing former peers or taking on managerial duties after years of virtual autonomy. <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201208/why-every-ceo-needs-coach?page=2\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Psychology Today on Coaching\">Research shows</a> when someone assumes a new or different leadership role, <strong>they have a 40% chance of demonstrating disappointing performance</strong>, and <strong>82% of newly appointed leaders derail</strong> because they fail to build partnerships with subordinates and peers. An executive coach will help you transition effectively and build others’ trust in your ability to do the job.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Reveal derailing behaviour or blind spots. </strong></p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">According to Harvard Business Review, 2 out of 5 new CEOs fail in their first 18 months on the job – not for lack of competence, but due to hubris and other self-limiting behaviors. Whether you’re a CEO or receptionist, understanding the impact you have with your actions versus the impact you <em>want</em> to have can literally make the difference between being good and being great at what you do. Sometimes discovering a blind spot means helping people uncover their true purpose or higher calling, along with the fears that prevent them from acknowledging and acting on it.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that a good coach – versus a mentor, colleague, therapist or even a trusted friend – will hold you accountable for reaching your goals and will play an active role in helping you achieve your desired success. </p>
<p><strong>Shared rewards</strong></p>
<p>After decades of success working with many talented leaders at some of the world’s best-known brands, I decided to make my own transition to executive coaching and I am thrilled to have just passed my CTI written exam. </p>
<p>As a coach, I’m trained to ask the questions that compel people to achieve what they truly want. Watching that transformation in my clients has made me completely fall in love with the practice of coaching. What I love most is that those who seek coaching are naturally capable human beings who can overcome and soar beyond their imaginations. And when they do, it’s miraculous for both of us. </p>
<p>The coaching methodology itself pushes me to continuously improve both in my coaching and in my life, so I get to practice what I preach. Coaching speaks to my values as a person – eg, about being, at times, fiercely courageous in holding my clients accountable to achieving their goals and I love the simplicity and purity of that design. </p>

<li><strong>#checkins-per-month:</strong> <strong>We had 6,041 checkins in May 2013</strong>. This is down from last month’s 6,364 checkins, and down from our record of 6,433 in Mar2013.<br />
<br />
<a href=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_05_trend.png\"><img align=\"center\" alt=\"Overall load since Jan 2009\" src=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_05_trend.png\" width=\"440\" /></a><p></p>
</li><li><strong>#checkins-per-day:</strong> We had <strong>293 checkins</strong> checkins on 21may. During May, 21-of-31 days had over 200 checkins-per-day – thats almost every working day. Only 7-of-31 days had over 250 checkins-per-day, much lower than usual. Unusually, we never exceeded 300 checkins-per-day any day this month – first time in many months.
</li><li><strong>#checkins-per-hour:</strong> Checkins are still mostly mid-day PT/afternoon ET. For 5 of every 24 hours, we sustained over 10 checkins per hour. Heaviest load time this month was 1pm-2pm PT (12.5 checkins-per-hour).
</li>
<p>As usual, our build pool handled the load well, with >95% of all builds consistently being started within 15mins. Our test pool continues to improve. All the hard work by RelEng, ATeam and IT is paying off, we’re seeing more test jobs being handled with better response times. The peak for May was 54,195 test jobs on 23may. Still more work to be done here, but encouraging. </p>
<p>As always, if you know of any test suites that no longer need to be run per-checkin, please let us know so we can immediately reduce the load a little. Also, if you know of any test suites which are perma-orange, and hidden on tbpl.m.o, please let us know – thats the worst of both worlds – using up scarce CPU time and not being displayed. We’ll make sure to file bugs to get tests fixed, or disabled – every little bit helps put scarce test CPU to better use.
</p></ul>
<p><strong>mozilla-inbound, birch/b2g-inbound, mozilla-central, fx-team:</strong><br />
Ratios of checkins across these branches remain fairly consistent. mozilla-inbound continues to be heavily used as an integration branch, dropping slightly to 24.2% of all checkins, yet still consistently far more then all other integration branches combined. mozilla-central increased slightly to 2.3% of checkins.</p>
<p>The “birch as b2g-inbound” experiment continued to be a great success, and with 4.2% of this month’s checkins landing here, birch has already become the 4th busiest branch (after try, mozilla-inbound and gaia-central). Birch is also helping reduce pain of any mozilla-inbound closures, and further proving the lure of sheriff-assisted-landings to developers. Given the success of this experiment, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875989\">bug#875989</a> tracks setting up b2g-inbound on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>The lure of sheriff assistance continues to be consistently popular, and as usual, very few people land directly on mozilla-central these days. The fx-team branch saw an increase to 2.1% of checkins, which I believe can be attributed to the increased help with landings from sheriffs (and sometimes gps) this month.</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>mozilla-aurora, mozilla-beta, mozilla-b2g18, gaia-central:</strong><br />
Of our total monthly checkins:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can clearly see weekends through the month. Its worth noting that we had >200 checkins-per-day almost every working day in May. This<br />
has been true for a few months now, so it is starting to feel like 200 checkins-per-day is the new “normal” for Mozilla. <a href=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_05_pushes.png\"><img alt=\"#Pushes this month\" src=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_05_pushes.png\" width=\"400\"\" /></a><p></p>

<h3>Keynote</h3>
<p>James Vasile opened this year’s Open Source Bridge with the first keynote of the week and he chose a serious topic: how we are living in an age of surveillance and that we need to create solutions to protect free speech.  Vasile referenced recent events like the Edward Snowden’s leak of the National Security Agency’s PRISM program and Internet Censorship in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Vasile talked fondly of the importance of open tools on the internet and technologies like encryption and pointed out that policy makers will not bring change.</p>
<h3>Sessions of Interest</h3>
<p>The first session of the day I attended was “Taming Your Inner Cowboy Coder – A Simple And Sane DevOps Workflow” a talk given by Greg Lund-Chaix and Evan Heidtmann. The talk discussed the tools and best practices for devops while working in development and production environments.</p>
<p>Next up was “DIY Electric Vehicles” a talk given by Ben Kero who works at Mozilla. Kero had informative slides and a even more informative talk as he shared his expertise in a hobby he has picked up: building DIY Electric Vehicles. Kero decribed the possibilities of making electric-powered bikes and cars and the anatomy of such vehicles and the basics of how to get started.</p>

The talk was packed with great slides and useful information and Kero stayed after to answer questions of people who were interesting in making apps or even porting Firefox OS.</p>
<p>I look forward to day two of Open Source Bridge tomorrow and the 5th Year Anniversary Party this Thursday at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. If you happen to be attending Open Source Bridge this week, don’t forget to <a href=\"https://stumptownsyndicate.wufoo.com/forms/citizenship-award-nominees-2013/\" target=\"_blank\">nominate</a> a hard-working open source contributor for the Open Source Citizenship Award (which will be given out on Thursday), consider a <a href=\"http://stumptownsyndicate.org/contribute/\" target=\"_blank\">donation to the nice folks at Stumptown Syndicate,</a> and be sure to come to the <a href=\"http://opensourcebridge.org/wiki/2013/Hacker_Lounge\">Firefox OS Hackday tomorrow night</a>!</p>

Not only is it useful on the growing number of x86 devices, it is also useful on the x86 emulator included in the Android SDK (for developers without access to a device). Presently, the x86 version is entirely separate form the ARM version - you would need both versions in different directories if you have devices on both platforms.
</p>
<p>
The updated GDB also has limited support for on-demand decompression on Android. If you've been noticing random seg faults when debugging Fennec, the new version will ignore these seg faults.

<p>Long time no see! I’ve been busy outside the blog-sphere and I’ve got some news to share. First of all, I upgraded my Firefox Add-on to version 0.1.7. So here is the link:</p>
<p><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-html5-switch/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"YouTube HTML5 Switch\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-html5-switch/</a></p>
<p>All in all, the important addition is that <strong>you can now use the hotkey Control+Y</strong> instead of pushing the button on the toolbar. Plus, I think it now has no other issues for most new versions of Firefox. I need to point out that I get most of the help from the SDK’s documentation which is great, but, to anyone interested, don’t hesitate to contribute to its content! Restartless add-ons rule!</p>
<p>You may use it and see if it works on YouTube (yeah it works, at least for Firefox 21.0 w/ Fedora Linux) using this video:</p>
<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block;\"></span>

create mockups that are linked to live bugs, similar to the ones at <a href=\"http://areweprettyyet.com/4/mainWindow/\">Are We
Pretty Yet</a>.  Now, I’ve got the
background showing up, and the bugs overlayed on top of it, but as it stands,
I’m requiring the designers to draw the lines connecting the bugs to the
various areas in the mockup right on the mockup itself!  This is obviously a
fairly terrible idea, since it makes it much harder than it should to move
stuff around after the fact, and requires a ton of up-front planning when
creating the initial image.  But what are my other options?</p>
<p>I thought for a while about layering a canvas element over the mockup; it would
let me draw whatever shapes I wanted to, but passing the click events through
to the mockup seemed like it would be fairly annoying, and I don’t think the
connecting lines should appear in front of the boxes showing the bug details,
which adds another wrinkle.  Then, over lunch, I started to wonder what it
would look like if a 1px by 1px black square got stretched and rotated with
CSS…  So I took some time after lunch, and played around a little, and it seems
like it just might work!  <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/aBjp7/8/\">Give it a try</a>, let
me know if you have any ideas to make it better, and feel free to take the idea
anywhere you think it might be useful!</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> In the comments, Andrew points out that I could use a 1px by 1px span
instead, which would let me change the background colour <em>much</em> easier, so I’ve
linked to his jsfiddle instead.</p>

create mockups that are linked to live bugs, similar to the ones at <a href=\"http://areweprettyyet.com/4/mainWindow/\">Are We
Pretty Yet</a>.  Now, I’ve got the
background showing up, and the bugs overlayed on top of it, but as it stands,
I’m requiring the designers to draw the lines connecting the bugs to the
various areas in the mockup right on the mockup itself!  This is obviously a
fairly terrible idea, since it makes it much harder than it should to move
stuff around after the fact, and requires a ton of up-front planning when
creating the initial image.  But what are my other options?</p>
<p>I thought for a while about layering a canvas element over the mockup; it would
let me draw whatever shapes I wanted to, but passing the click events through
to the mockup seemed like it would be fairly annoying, and I don’t think the
connecting lines should appear in front of the boxes showing the bug details,
which adds another wrinkle.  Then, over lunch, I started to wonder what it
would look like if a 1px by 1px black square got stretched and rotated with
CSS…  So I took some time after lunch, and played around a little, and it seems
like it just might work!  <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/aBjp7/8/\">Give it a try</a>, let me
know if you have any ideas to make it better, and feel free to take the idea
anywhere you think it might be useful!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In the comments, Andrew points out that I could use a 1px by 1px
span instead, which would make it <em>much</em> easier to change the colour of the
line, so I’ve linked to his jsfiddle instead.  :)</p>

<p>I often find myself in situations where I have multiple tabs that I opened only to look at for short periods of time. Sometimes I reach this state while reading articles on Hacker News or looking at funny pictures on Reddit. At the end of looking at the tabs, it would be nice if Firefox had a way to close these ephemeral tabs so you can get back to your previous work quicker.</p>
<p><img alt=\"Close Tabs to The Right\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3225\" src=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/2013-06-14_1336.png?w=480\" style=\"border: 4px solid rgb(34,34,34); margin: 1em auto;\" /></p>
<p>Well, Firefox now does! If you open lots of tabs from Reddit and then want to close all of the tabs to the right of Reddit, just right-click on the Reddit tab and choose “Close Tabs to the Right”. It’s easy and quick!</p>
<p>Why “close tabs to the right” and not “close tabs to the left”? When we open new tabs they appear on the end, and so naturally tabs that have a longer lifetime end up being promoted to the start-side of the bar. This leads us towards the situation where closing tabs “to the right” is a simple way of closing the ephemeral tabs.</p>
<p>Users who are using Firefox with a right-to-left locale such as Hebrew or Arabic should see the equivalent “Close Tabs to the Left” feature.</p>
<p>Huge thanks go out to Michael Brennan who contributed <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=866880\">the patches and automated tests</a> for this feature! Unless something drastic happens, this feature will find its way to Firefox Release in just over 12 weeks in Firefox 24.</p>

<p>This week-end took place in Mozilla’s Paris office the Summit 2013 planning assembly: a gathering of about 65 people from all around the world and representing all areas of the Mozilla project, with both paid staff and volunteers, aimed to plan and shape the next Summit, that will take place the first week-end of October in Bruxelles, Toronto and Santa Clara.</p>
<p>TL;DR: it’s been a great assembly. If we manage to accomplish at the next Summit half of the things we’ve discussed in this week-end, it will have been the best Mozilla event ever.</p>
<p>The aim of the assembly was not to define a schedule for the event and fix everything but to talk about which are the important topics that animate the Mozilla project these days, start to discuss them and shape them in a way so that we can come out with a good format for the Summit to address them and try to give and propose solutions for them. To do this, all the planning committee has taken interviews to fellow Mozillians in the last month to have a wider view of which is the temperature of the project in these days and act as a representative for the comments expressed.</p>
<p>I went to Paris without a clear idea of what we would have accomplished there, but I’m impressed with the result we had.<br />
First of all, this assembly was facilitated by people of <a href=\"http://www.unconference.net\">unconference.net</a>, who proposed a peculiar way to proceed with it. I was a bit skeptic with the method proposed, but it turned out that some of their <a href=\"http://www.unconference.net/methods/\">methods</a> are really great (like unpanel) and we will definitely adopt them for the next Summit, while some others still look like rubbish (I may still be proved wrong).<br />
The second important fact is that we talked little about technology and a lot about Mozilla, its community, its communication (internal and external) and the interactions between its components and people. On one hand, as Gandalf pointed out, this is a sign that we trust implicitly our technology and the fact that it will be discussed at the Summit, because this is a big portion of what Mozilla is about. On the other hand, it’s a sign that there’s a general awareness, not only among community members but also (finally) among employees and paid staff and board of directors that we have communication problems between the different parts of the projects and especially between paid staff and volunteers, and the time is now mature to address and try to solve them. What I’m talking about is not only communication to get things done but also communication related to the decision-making process.</p>
<p>So, it will be interesting to experiment discussions around different time-zones and locations. I will probably post more about the assembly and the planning for the Summit in the next days, when ideas and thoughts will have settled down a bit and I’ll have had the time to read all the ideas and documentation we produced during this two days. What I felt important to communicate immediately is the fact that the next Summit will be a wonderful occasion to talk not only about our technologies but also about who we are, what we want to do and where we want to go. It will be an occasion for the community to teach and mentor the newest community members and more importantly all the new employees to let them understand and feel the power and importance of our community and it will be, in general, an occasion to have our voice finally be heard and taken into consideration not only in the tasks at hand, but in building the new policies and guidelines that will drive all the project in the future.</p>
<p>I’m sure we’ll try, in the next months, to provide some initial information and documentation about what have been discussed and decided so far so that you can arrive at the Summit prepared to give your contribution to the conversation, so that we can take the most out of the Summit and make it really matter in our future.</p>
<p>As I said at the beginning: if we manage to discuss and propose solutions to half of the problems and concerns raised during this two days, we will have had the best Mozilla event ever; one that will have strengthened and made our project more mature.</p>" nil nil "93b854b21a946eca76cd509409195d8c") (68 (20928 8795 843215) "http://aaronmt.github.com/blog/2013/06/17/webrtc-testday" "Aaron Train: Discover and Help Test WebRTC in Firefox for Android and Firefox on Desktop on Friday June 21st, 2013" nil "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "<p>This upcoming Friday, we would love for you to solicit your support towards testing and contributing to the process of qualifying a new developer-release version of Firefox for Android and Firefox on Desktop both on the <a href=\"http://nightly.mozilla.org\">Nightly</a> channel as part of our rapid release testing cycle. We will be focusing on the process of discovering, using and testing <a href=\"http://www.webrtc.org/\">WebRTC</a>.</p>
<p>WebRTC is a free, open project that enables web browsers with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple Javascript APIs. The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose. The WebRTC mission is to enable rich, high quality, RTC applications to be developed in the browser via simple Javascript APIs and HTML5. The WebRTC initiative is a project supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera.</p>
<p>This QA event, this Friday, is open to <strong>all</strong> those interested: newcomers, experienced testers, developers, and anyone interested in testing early builds of Firefox on the Nightly channel.</p>
<p>We would like for you to use the new version of Firefox on your Android phone and desktop or laptop machine, and take a close look at the latest Nightly builds in order to assist us in identifying any noticeably major issues found with our <a href=\"http://www.webrtc.org/\">WebRTC</a> implementation, and ensure that all feature functionality that is included in this upcoming release is on its way to a feature and testing complete state.</p>
<p>To cover the work throughout the whole day we have created an <a href=\"https://etherpad.mozilla.org/testday-20130621-webrtc\">EtherPad</a> test-plan. Please feel free to read and use it as a companion during the day’s event. There will be moderators at hand in the IRC channel: <a href=\"http://goo.gl/1c6h7\">#testday</a>, to answer any questions you have.</p>
<p>Together with your help we want to make this event a success and ensure the high quality of WebRTC support in Firefox for all of our users world-wide. If you have time on Friday June 21st, 2013, please join us on IRC, we will have Mozilla community and testers on hand to help answer any of your questions.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://codepo8.github.io/canvas-masking/\"><img alt=\"masks\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3509\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/masks.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>
<p>All you need to do is add the canvasmask.js script and add a class of mask to each image you want to mask. You also need to provide a <span class=\"caps\">PNG</span> file as the mask using the data-mask attribute. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><div class=\"wp_syntax\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre class=\"xml\" style=\"font-family: monospace;\"><span style=\"color: #009900;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\"><img</span> <span style=\"color: #000066;\">src</span>=<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\"red-panda.jpg\"</span> </span>
<span style=\"color: #009900;\">     <span style=\"color: #000066;\">alt</span>=<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\"Red panda\"</span> </span>
<span style=\"color: #009900;\">     <span style=\"color: #000066;\">class</span>=<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\"mask\"</span> </span>
<span style=\"color: #009900;\">     <span style=\"color: #000066;\">data-mask</span>=<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\"centerblur.png\"</span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">></span></span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p></p>
<p>This will take the centerblur.png file and apply it as a mask to red-panda.jpg – in effect taking the alpha of each pixel and change the alpha of the original pixel to that.</p>
<p>You can <a href=\"http://codepo8.github.io/canvas-masking/\">see it in action here</a> and <a href=\"http://github.com/codepo8/canvas-masking/\">get the code on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><del>Under the hood, all I do is loop through all the pixels of the images (after copying them to two canvas elements) and apply the alpha values (every 4th value in the pixeldata array) of the <span class=\"caps\">PNG</span> to the image. Simple, really :)</del></p>
<p><ins>As mentioned by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/345836125132320768\">Jake Archibald on Twitter</a> there is no need to loop over the pixels of the images, all you need is to copy the mask first, then change the canvas compositing to source-atop and add the image. Done. The script does that now, and thus is much faster.</ins></p>

Why? Most of my add-ons do something in the background at the user's request, and when it's done, the user wants to know. Alternatively, if my add-on attempts to do something and fails, the user would see nothing happen at all, unless I somehow tell them.</p>
<p>In real life, this is supposed to look something like this example, from <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-url-252534/\">\"Copy URL\"</a>:</p>
<p><img alt=\"Copy URL notification\" src=\"http://fredericiana.com/media/2013/copy-url-notification.jpg\" /></p>
<p>The Mozilla Add-ons SDK even has a <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/modules/sdk/notifications.html\">convenient API</a> for it. Easy, right?</p>
<p>Sadly, not so fast: While the SDK is supposed to abstract all of this neatly away from me and \"just work\" on Linux, Windows, and OS X, the behavior is inconsistent, owed -- on OS X, anyway -- to the wonky state of notification support on the operating system level.</p>
<h3>To Growl or not to Growl</h3>
<p>I've ran into issues with notifications repeatedly over time, and employed a number of solutions so far. <em>Spoiler alert:</em> I am happy with none of them.</p>
<p>OS X 10.7 and below relied on a third-party tool called <a href=\"http://growl.info/\">Growl</a> to support notifications. If you had it installed, the SDK's API would work just great. Sadly, if you <em>didn't</em> have it installed, notifications would <strong>silently be swallowed</strong>. Worse yet, I was unable to detect if this happened, so I had no way to implement a fallback mechanism.</p>
<p>The OS X 10.8 \"notification center\" was supposed to fix this, but <a href=\"http://canuckistani.ca/blog/2012/10/28/10-dot-8-notification-center-sucks/\">apparently</a>, it will only display our notifications if the browser does <strong>not</strong> have the focus. In other words, it's completely useless for in-context notifications.</p>
<p>I considered all that a very poor user experience and instead of using the SDK's API, I implemented my own notifications module called <a href=\"https://github.com/fwenzel/copy-shorturl/blob/a6ed22d/lib/simple-notify.js\">\"simple-notify\"</a> that would detect the availability of the notifications service (i.e., Growl or any other platform-specific service) first, and if none was found would employ a fallback mechanism.</p>
<h3>The ugly but reliable notifications bar</h3>
<p>The fallback mechanism I use is the once-ubiquitous, gray, Firefox notification bar:</p>
<p><img alt=\"Copy ShortURL notification bar\" src=\"http://fredericiana.com/media/2013/copy-shorturl-notification-bar.jpg\" /></p>
<p>It is shown in context, grabs the user's attention (perhaps a little too much) <em>and</em>, most importantly, <strong>it is reliably available on all platforms</strong>.</p>
<p>This notification bar has its downsides: For example, it's fairly intrusive and not easily ignored. My add-ons usually auto-close it after a few seconds. If I didn't do that, the bar would persist until closed by the user. This solution also can't handle more than one notification at a time: A second notification will overlay the previous one.</p>
<h3>HTML5 Notifications API</h3>
<p>Luckily, there's hope. The <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/\">W3C Notifications API</a> landed <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/04/hidpi-support-html5-notifications-parallel-js-asm-js-and-more-firefox-development-highlights/\">in Firefox 22</a>, which (at the time of writing) is the next upcoming release version. If the Add-ons SDK is updated to use this API, this should finally allow me to use one line of code for notifications, not a few dozen.</p>
<p>In the context of a page, I can even use it already (without Add-ons SDK support), with two caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>To remain backwards compatible (for a while, anyway) I'd still have to implement a fallback mechanism. Once Firefox 22 is the current release version, however, I could relax that rule and just live with the fact that users of previous versions may or may not receive notifications.</li>
<li>The W3C standard (rightly) requires to ask for permission before a website can issue notifications. Add-ons should be able to use notifications without explicit permission step.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm looking forward to the time when all this will smoothly work as expected!</p>

to create mockups that are linked to live bugs, similar to the ones at <a href=\"http://areweprettyyet.com/4/mainWindow/\">Are We
Pretty Yet</a>.  Now, I’ve got the
background showing up, and the bugs overlayed on top of it, but as it stands,
I’m requiring the designers to draw the lines connecting the bugs to the various
areas in the mockup right on the mockup itself!  This is obviously a fairly
terrible idea, since it makes it much harder than it should to move stuff around
after the fact, and requires a ton of up-front planning when creating the
initial image.  But what are my other options?</p>
<p>I thought for a while about layering a canvas element over the mockup; it would
let me draw whatever shapes I wanted to, but passing the click events through to
the mockup seemed like it would be fairly annoying, and I don’t think the
connecting lines should appear in front of the boxes showing the bug details,
which adds another wrinkle.  Then, over lunch, I started to wonder what it would
look like if a <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/blob/feature/angular/public/images/black-line.png\">1px by 1px black square</a> got stretched and rotated with CSS…  So I took some time after lunch, and played around a
little, and it seems like it just might work!  <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/aBjp7/3/\">Give it a try</a>, let me know if you have any ideas to make it
better, and feel free to take the idea anywhere you think it might be useful!</p>

<p>I’ve had a wonderful time at Mozilla. I’ve gotten to work with some exceptional people while making the world a better place, and I’m extremely proud of how far we’ve come in my corner of things since I arrived (23x email list, 4x donations, thousands involved in Webmaker, millions in SOPA/PIPA/ITU/PRISM, and more). Thanks so much to everyone who made it possible!</p>
<p>And I’m very excited to start at <a href=\"http://www.mobilisationlab.org/\">Greenpeace</a>. I’ve long had a nagging feeling that what I should really be doing is working on climate change — it’s such an urgent issue, and there are so many bad actors trying to directly stop any progress in fighting it, that I feel it’s important to do what I can with as much time as I can. <strong>And I love a good fight.</strong></p>
<p>So, more to come on that front.</p>
<p>But they say “Once a Mozillian, always a Mozillian” for a reason — I’ve every intention of remaining involved in the fight to keep the web open, secure, and hackable. <strong>It’s something <a href=\"http://greenpeaceblogs.org/2013/06/13/for-a-healthy-environment-we-need-a-free-internet/\">we all need</a>.</strong><br /></p>

<h3>The Old Big Ticket Items List</h3>
<h4>#5: Better Script Handling</h4>
<p>This had two parts.  The first part was the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=679942\">sharing of immutable parts of scripts</a>, which Till Schneidereit implemented.  It can save multiple MiBs of memory, particular if you have numerous tabs open from the same website.</p>
<p>The second part is <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678037\">lazy bytecode generation</a>, which Brian Hackett has implemented and landed, though it hasn’t yet enabled.  Brian is working out the remaining kinks and hopes to land by the end of the current (v24) cycle.    Hopefully he will, because measurements have shown that it can reduce Firefox’s memory consumption by 5% or more on common workloads!  That’s a huge, general improvement.  Furthermore, it significantly reduces the number of things that are allocated on the GC heap (i.e. scripts, strings, objects and shapes that are created when bytecode for a function is generated).  This reduces pressure on the GC which makes it less likely we’ll have bad GC behaviour (e.g. pauses, or too much memory consumption) in cases where the GC heuristics aren’t optimal.</p>
<p>So the first part is done and the second is imminent, which is enough to cross this item off the list.  [Update:  Brian <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678037#c93\">just enabled lazy bytecode on trunk</a>!]</p>
<h4>#4: Regain compartment-per-global losses</h4>
<p>Bill McCloskey implemented <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=759585\">zones</a>, which restructured the heap to allow a certain amount of sharing between zones. This greatly reduced wasted space and reduced memory consumption in common cases by ~5%.</p>
<p>Some more could still be done for this issue.  In particular, it’s not clear if things have improved enough that many small JSMs can be used without wasting memory.  Nonetheless, things have improved enough that I’m happy to take this item off the list.</p>
<h4>#3: Boot2Gecko</h4>
<p>This item was about getting about:memory (or something similar) working on B2G, and using it to optimize memory.  This was done some time ago and the memory reporters (plus DMD) were enormously helpful in improving memory consumption.  Many of the fixes fell under the umbrella of <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=797189\">Operation Slim Fast</a>.</p>
<p>So I will remove this particular item from the list, but memory optimizations for B2G are far from over, as we’ll see below.</p>
<h4>#2: Compacting Generational GC</h4>
<p>See below.</p>
<h4>#1: Better Foreground Tab Image Handling</h4>
<p>See below.</p>
<h3>The New Big Ticket Items List</h3>
<h4>#5: pdf.js</h4>
<p>pdf.js was recently made the default way of opening PDFs in Firefox, replacing plug-ins such as Adobe Reader.  While this is great in a number of respects, such as security, it’s not as good for memory consumption, because <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881974\">pdf.js can use a lot of memory</a> in at least some cases.  We need to investigate the known cases and improve things.</p>
<h4>#4: Dev tools</h4>
<p>While we’ve made great progress with memory profiling tools that help Firefox developers, the situation is not nearly as good for web developers.  Google Chrome has heap profiling tools for web developers, and Firefox should too.  (The design space for heap profilers is quite large and so Firefox shouldn’t just copy Chrome’s tools.)  Alexandre Poirot has started work on a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=863228\">promising prototype</a>, though there is a lot of work remaining before any such prototype can make it into a release.</p>
<h4>#3: B2G Nuwa</h4>
<p>Cervantes Yu and Thinker Li have been working on <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=771765\">Nuwa</a>, which aims to give B2G a pre-initialized template process from which every subsequent process will be forked.  This might sound esoteric, but the important part is that it greatly increases the ability for B2G processes to share unchanging data.  In <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=771765#c29\">one test run</a>, this increased the number of apps that could be run simultaneously from five to <em>nine</em>, which is obviously a big deal.  The downside is that getting it to work requires some extremely hairy fiddling with low-level code.  Fingers crossed it can be made to work reliably!</p>
<p>Beyond Nuwa, there is still plenty of other ways that B2G can have its memory consumption optimized, as you’d expect in an immature mobile OS.  Although I won’t list anything else in the big ticket items list, work will continue here, as per <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/MemShrink\">MemShrink’s primary aim:</a> “MemShrink is a project that aims to reduce the memory consumption of Firefox (on desktop and mobile) and Firefox OS.”</p>
<h4>#2: Compacting Generational GC</h4>
<p>Generational GC will reduce fragmentation, reduce the working set size, and speed up collections.  Great progress has been made here — the enormous task of <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=753203\">exactly rooting</a> the JS engine and the browser is basically finished, helped along greatly by a static analysis implemented by Brian Hackett.  And Terrence Cole and others are well into converting the collector to be generational.  So we’re a lot closer than we were, but there is still some way to go.  So this item is steady at #2.</p>
<h4>#1: Better Foreground Tab Image Handling</h4>
<p>Firefox still uses much more memory than other browsers on image-heavy pages.  Fortunately, a great deal of progress has been made here.  Timothy Nikkel <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=689623\">fixed things</a> so that memory usage when scrolling through image-heavy pages is greatly reduced.  However, this change caused some <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=845147\">jank on pages with lots of small images</a>, so it’s currently disabled on the non-trunk branches.  Also, there is still a memory spike when <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=847223\">memory-heavy pages are first loaded</a>, which needs to be fixed before this item can be considered done.  So this item remains at #1.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Three items from the old list (#3, #4, #5) have been ticked off.  Two items remain (#1, #2) — albeit with good progress having been made — and keep their positions on the list.  Three items have been added to the new list (#3, #4, #5).<br />
Let me know if I’ve omitted anything important!</p>" nil nil "bc93f51b14d33facb775327253bb8b2a") (58 (20928 8795 831634) "http://robert.ocallahan.org/2013/06/developer-parallelism.html" "Robert O'Callahan: Developer Parallelism" "Robert" "Fri, 14 Jun 2013 12:40:17 +0000" "<p>In Gecko we've often had N large projects be implemented by just one person each. This has some benefits; in particular it can be quite efficient, since coordination costs are low. It's also a good way to reduce the amount of code learning developers have to do. Another approach is to put N people to work on one large project, and hopefully get it done in roughly 1/N of the time. I think the latter is probably a better way to work. I think we get better reviews, since at least for me, I do much better reviews in code I've actually hacked on than in code I've never touched. It means that if someone gets hit by a bus --- or worse still, leaves Mozilla --- we've got people who we know can work on the code. Projects getting completed faster means there's less bitrot to deal with. It makes us more agile (I hate that word though). Perhaps most importantly, it's more fun. </p><p>Most of our projects go through a startup/prototyping phase where we write some new code and get things basically working. Then there's a grind phase where we get the code working on all platforms, iron out the corner cases, fix all the regressions, fix all the fuzz bugs, write tests, and get it landed. The latter phase is usually a lot more work than the startup phase, but it's also the phase that parallelizes across developers fairly easily. So I think we should consciously try to work this way: when a project enters the grind phase, we should shift developers onto it until it's over the line. We've done some of this recently with fixing rooting hazards in JS, and in the layers refactoring. </p><p>In cases like OMTC there's some flexibility since getting the project \"over the line\" isn't all-or-nothing. Having people individually bring up platforms one-by-one works OK and brings incremental benefits. Same goes for converting code from XPIDL to WebIDL. So for those, the benefit of having a lot of people pile on is reduced (especially, in a conversion project, if we know that for some reason or another we will never be able to completely eliminate the stuff we're converting from). </p><p>In any case, I hope that from now on, for any project of significant size we have at least two people working on it during the grind phase, to capture the benefits I mentioned above.

<code><br />

<p>This isn’t very helpful, and I ran into this exact issue while working on some code that uses observers. Since the data is passed as JSON, when <code>JSON.stringify(null)</code> is called the result is “null”.

Say you have a HTML <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">select</span></span> having <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">optgroup</span></span> elements like<br /><br />  <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><select></span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">    <option>item</span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">    <optgroup label=\"group\"></span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">      <option>subitem</span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">    </optgroup></span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">  </select> </span></span><br /><br />then we used to have an accessible hierarchy like:<br /><br />  <span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span>combobox - HTML select</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span>   option - HTML option (item)</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span>   heading - HTML optgroup</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span>   option- HTML option (subitem)</span></span><br /><br />Firefox 23 exposes the following hierarchy:<br /><br />  <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">combobox</span></span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span> - HTML select</span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">   option</span></span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span> - HTML option (item)</span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">   grouping </span></span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span>- HTML optgroup</span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">     option </span></span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span>- HTML option (subitem)</span></span><br /><br /><br />* Another change is HTML5 <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">input@type=range</span></span> <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=559764\">is now accessible</a>. It's exposed as a slider role and implements the value interface, i.e. you can obtain min, max and current values and step. Also it fires value change events.<br /><br /><h3>Nasty bugs</h3><br />A bug where JAWS lost the virtual buffer <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=866495\">was fixed</a>. The patch was back ported to Firefox 22 and Firefox 21.<br /><br />Another bug was that we lost inactive document occasionally. So if the user didn't interact with the document and the document wasn't self updated via JavaScript then it could be not accessible for screen readers (see <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=862863\">bug</a>).<br /><br /><h3>ISimpleDOM support</h3><br />Yet another ISimpleDOM interface (<span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">ISimpleDOMText</span></span>) was <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=865588\">tear offed</a> as continuation of <a href=\"http://asurkov.blogspot.ru/2012/12/isimpledom-support.html\">this work</a>.<br /><br /><h3>Other bug fixes</h3><br />* A selection bug where we wrongly claimed that unfocused text area has a selection <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=440590\">was fixed</a>.<br /><br />* We  don't prune children anymore for number of roles like text entry, menu  items and etc if they have complex trees.  In other words, if for example a text entry has anything else than a plain text  then you will see that in hierarchy (see <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=865997\">bug</a>). So if you do<br /><br />  <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><div role=\"textbox\"><span role=\"button\"></span></div></span></span><br /><br />then you will get a button inside the text entry.</div>" nil nil "591c7f1cf00ca0e5fd1cec7d7994c0d5") (54 (20928 8795 829052) "http://www.peterbe.com/plog/in-python-you-sort-with-a-tuple" "Peter Bengtsson: In Python you sort with a tuple" nil "Fri, 14 Jun 2013 01:34:53 +0000" "<p>My colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/axelhecht\">Axel Hecht</a> showed me something I didn't know about sorting in Python.<br />
</p>
<p>In Python you can sort with a tuple. It's best illustrated with a simple example:<br />
</p>
<div class=\"highlight\">
<pre><span class=\"o\">>>></span> <span class=\"n\">items</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'B'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'A'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'A'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'B'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'a'</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span>
<span class=\"o\">>>></span> <span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">items</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>
<span class=\"p\">[(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'B'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'a'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'A'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'B'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'A'</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>By default the <code>sort</code> and the <code>sorted</code> built-in function notices that the items are tuples so it sorts on the first element first and on the second element second.<br />
</p>
<p>However, notice how you get <code>(0, 'B')</code> appearing before <code>(0, 'a')</code>. That's because upper case comes before lower case characters. However, suppose you wanted to apply some \"humanization\" on that and sort case insensitively. You might try:<br />
</p>
<div class=\"highlight\">
<pre><span class=\"o\">>>></span> <span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">items</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">key</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lower</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>
<span class=\"n\">Traceback</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">most</span> <span class=\"n\">recent</span> <span class=\"n\">call</span> <span class=\"n\">last</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>

</pre></div>
<p>which is an error we deserve because this won't work for the first part of each tuple.<br />
</p>
<p>We could try to write a lambda function (e.g. <code>sorted(items, key=lambda x: x.lower() if isinstance(x, str) else x)</code>) but that's not going to work because you'll only ever get to apply that to the first item.<br />
</p>
<p>Without further ado, here's how you do it. A lambda function that returns a tuple:<br />
</p>
<div class=\"highlight\">
<pre><span class=\"o\">>>></span> <span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">items</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">key</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">lambda</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lower</span><span class=\"p\">()))</span>
<span class=\"p\">[(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'a'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'B'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'A'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'B'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'A'</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And there you have it! Thanks for sharing Axel!<br />
</p>
<p>As a bonus item for people still reading...<br />
I'm sure you know that you can reverse a sort order simply by passing in <code>sorted(items, reverse=True, ...)</code> but what if you want to have different directions depend on the key that you're sorting on.<br />
</p>
<p>Using the technique of a lambda function that returns a tuple, here's how we sort a slightly more advanced structure:<br />
</p>
<div class=\"highlight\">
<pre><span class=\"o\">>>></span> <span class=\"n\">peeps</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[{</span><span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'Bill'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'Bill'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">500</span><span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'Ted'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">500</span><span class=\"p\">}]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And now, sort with a lambda function returning a tuple:<br />
</p>
<div class=\"highlight\">
<pre><span class=\"o\">>>></span> <span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">peeps</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">key</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">lambda</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">]))</span>
<span class=\"p\">[{</span><span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">500</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'Bill'</span><span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'Bill'</span><span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">500</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'Ted'</span><span class=\"p\">}]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Makes sense, right? <code>Bill</code> comes before <code>Ted</code> and 500 comes before 1000. But how do you sort it like that on the name <em>but reverse on the salary</em>? Simple, negate it:<br />
</p>
<div class=\"highlight\">

<li>In the US, buying a cellphone “out-of-contract” is not the same as buying a cellphone “unlocked”. All of the following only works for an unlocked phone. Make sure your phone is unlocked before you get on the plane.</li>
<li>Different cellphone companies have different policies on this. AT&T declared that, despite my being a multi-year customer, with no contract, they would not unlock my phone per policy. T-Mobile said upfront that they would need ~40days from date-of-purchase of “out-of-contact” phone before I could ask to have it unlocked. On the 40th day, when I asked T-Mobile to unlock my phone, they sent me the phone unlock codes within 48hours.</li>
<li>Make sure your phone supports GSM. Sounds obvious, but still needs to be said, as most countries use GSM. </li>

I bought mine at the train station in Lisbon, but they are also for sale on most small street corner stores. While there are several mobile companies selling pay-as-you-go, I went with Lycamobile because they had the best price for all-you-can-use data at 4G speeds, great high speed coverage everywhere I went, and no hassle about using your cellphone as a hotspot. Oh, and comparable prices for voice calls and text messaging.
</li><li>Disassemble your phone to swap out sim card, insert new LycaMobile sim card and power up the phone.
</li><li>On the phone, enter “*#123#″ and press dial (typically, the green handset button). This connects you to an automated service that tells you your balance.
</li><li>To find out what your lycamobile phone number is, dial “*#122#”
</li><li>Assuming that all works, you should now attempt to call any local number. By habit, I call the mobile phone of the person at the store selling me the SIM card.
</li><li>Cultural tip: I never setup voicemail – as discovered in my other recent trips, most people dont both leaving voice messages on cellphones anymore – if they cant reach you when they phone, they hangup and send you a text message instead.
</li><li>Now that you can make/receive calls, to make my Android 2.2 phone transmit/receive data, I had to add the following APN settings:<br />
* on home screen, go into “settings”<br />
* go into “wireless & network settings”<br />
* go into “mobile networks”<br />
* go into “access point names”<br />
* if there is not already a “data.lycamobile.pt” APN, then create one as follows:<br />
** Name = data.lycamobile.pt<br />
** APN == data.lycamobile.pt<br />
** Proxy == Not set<br />
** Port == Not set<br />
** Username == impt<br />
** Password == impt<br />
** Server == Not set<br />
** MMSC == Not set<br />
** MMS proxy == Not set<br />
** MMS port == Not set<br />
** MCC == 268<br />
** MNC == 04<br />
** Authentication Type == Not set<br />
** APN Type == Not set<br />
…hit save, and go back to “Access Point Names”.<p></p>
</li><li>verify that this new “data.lycamobile.pt” APK is present, and is selected.
</li><li>verify that “Use only 2G networks” is not selected.
</li><li>Reboot the phone to see if that helps.
</li><li>At this point you should be able to make/receive calls, send/receive text messages, surf the web, use your cellphone as GPS, and use your cellphone as a wifi hotspot.
</li><li>To check your account balance dial “*122#”.
</li><li>When you need additional credits, buy a one-time use scratch-refill “top up” card at almost any corner store, and follow the instructions on the back.

<a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/users/ahalberstadt_mozilla.com/qqver/\">qqver</a> is a Mercurial extension that forces mq
to version all patch queues in the same repository. The syntax is the exact same as when doing normal patch queue
versioning (i.e 'hg init --mq'), except the repo is created one directory higher so it is able to track all patch
queues. As with stock queue repos, new and existing patches are added automatically.
</p>
<p>
qqver solves a very specific use case, it probably isn't useful for the majority of Mercurial users. If you answer yes
to both of the following questions, you might want to look into qqver:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you like to work with multiple patch queues in a single repository (i.e using hg qq)?</li>
<li>Do you like to version your patch queues with mq's patch versioning system (i.e using the --mq flag)?</li>
</ol>
<p>
Versioning all patch queues in the same repo makes it a lot easier to create and manage remote repos, e.g on an hg.m.o <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Creating_Mercurial_User_Repositories#Mercurial_Queue_User_Repository_Workflow\">user repository</a>. Instead of having to create N user repositories for N patch queues, you only need to create one.
</p>
<p>
qqver works by monkeypatching the mq extension in an unobtrusive way. This gives it some nice
properties. First, the syntax is the exact same as what you are already used to:
</p>
<pre># create queue repo and push remote
hg init --mq
hg commit --mq
hg push --mq
</pre>
<p>
Another nice property is that it is fully compatible with Steve Fink's <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/sfink/mqext\">mqext</a>
extension. This means if you want to autocommit your patch queue anytime you make a change, you can easily do so by
configuring mqext. One thing I'd still like to implement, is to monkeypatch mqext so it adds the current patch queue to the commit
messages (in addition to the patch name).
</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<pre>hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/users/ahalberstadt_mozilla.com/qqver/
</pre>
<p>
Then edit your ~/.hgrc file and add:
</p>
<pre>[extensions]
mq=
qqver=<path/to/qqver>
</pre>
<p>
Note that the mq extension needs to be installed, otherwise qqver makes no sense! Also note that this is still fairly untested,
so please let me know of any problems you encounter or features you'd like implemented. Or feel free to send me a patch ;).

They provide a nice way to show an alternative or a secondary context in an activity. <code><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ShareActionProvider.html\">ShareActionProvider</a></code> takes them to another level. The secondary context of showing a list of shareable activities is available as a menu item. In addition, they show the most frequently used Activity for quick sharing. But they come with a downside. As the name says, ActionProviders can only be present in an ActionBar. Most of the popular android apps don’t use an ActionBar as it is very limiting. Firefox for Android has the same problem, as it doesn’t use an ActionBar. How do we provide the user with such a fast and easy access to the most frequently used activity?</p>
<p>Since Firefox for Android uses a custom menu, adding an ActionProvider logic inside a ListView was easy. Analogous to the ShareActionProvider, the main menu item gives the list of shareable activities as a <code>SubMenu</code>, and the most frequently used app is shown along with the actual menu item. To use the same metrics as Android for the frequency calculation, we chose to use the same underlying model. Android’s implementation of storing and receiving applications from an XML file, ordering the applications based on a time based weight is available in <code><a href=\"https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/android/widget/ActivityChooserModel.java\">ActivityChooserModel</a></code>. (Note: When used, one would have to copy this file to their code base, as this file is an internal file).</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_315\" style=\"width: 235px;\"><a href=\"http://sriramramani.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/share-quickly/quick-share/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-315\"><img alt=\"Share menu item with the more frequently used application for sharing quickly.\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-315\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://sriramramani.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/quick-share.png?w=225&h=400\" width=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Share menu item with the more frequently used application for sharing quickly.</p></div>
<p>While working on this feature, I was left with so many puzzling discoveries!</p>
<ul>
<li>While setting an Intent with ShareActionProvider for the first time, it calls ActivityChooserModel’s setIntent(). This triggers reading the list from the history file by calling <code><a href=\"https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/android/widget/ActivityChooserModel.java#L975\">readHistoricalDataImpl</a>()</code>. The problem here is that, even though the comment — oops, just a comment! — says everything is done off the UI thread, the reading of a file from the disk and parsing it happens in the UI thread. This causes StrictModeViolation, and hogs the UI.</li>
<li>ShareActionProvider’s <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ShareActionProvider.html#setShareIntent%28android.content.Intent%29\">setShareIntent()</a> should be used sparsely. Though one of the Android articles touches this, the reason is not explained. Let’s say the application is a photo sharing application and it needs to update the image date when the user flips through the gallery. Calling <code>setShareIntent()</code> sounds the easiest way. However, setShareIntent() rebuilds the list every single time. And, as I mentioned earlier, setShareIntent() runs on the UI thread. This would result in UI jankiness. Instead, it’s better to store the Intent that was given to the ShareActionProvider, and update the <code>EXTRA</code> parameters in it, leaving the <code>ACTION</code> and MIME type intact. This way, the intent remains the same, and the data varies, without doing any work on the UI thread. But hey, there is not getter for this method! So, it’s our responsibility to store it in our class.</li>
<li>Even getters in this file wants to ensure a consistent state. In case something had changed with the list of activities, either it loads them all once again, or reads from the disk. Which thread will this run on? Clicking on the Share icon, would ask the ActionProvider to get a list of activities. The event handling runs on the UI thread. This in turn ensures a consistent state and returns the items back on the UI thread. So, every setter or getter will (usually) be run on the UI thread and could cause considerable work to be done on the main thread.</li>
<li>Lets say, some other application wants to expose Share with a custom ActionProvider like Firefox for Android. When they try to use the ActivityChooserModel, there is a reference to <code><a href=\"https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/com/android/internal/content/PackageMonitor.java\">PackageMonitor</a></code>. Unfortunately this file is internal and has a lot of other internal dependencies. Commenting the related code will leave the history file, and the list in a stale state if some other shareable app is installed/uninstalled while this app is in the background.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phew! Basically ShareActionProvider is some sort of a UI hog, if not used correctly. ActionProviders cannot be used outside of ActionBar, even though they provide a nice paradigm. Why Android, why?</p>

<p>Turns out I haven't announced an ElasticUtils release since August
2012. Why? Partially because up until now, I always had deep-seated
problems with ElasticUtils and wasn't excited about announcing yet
another version with things I disliked in it.</p>
<p>I feel really good about v0.7 for a variety of reasons. Let me tell
you some of them:</p>
<ol class=\"arabic\">
<li><p class=\"first\">We switched from pyes to pyelasticsearch. I'm really happy with
this.</p>
</li>
<li><p class=\"first\">There was a monumental effort to fix sharp edges in the API,
generalize bits that needed generalizing, improve the quality of
the software, improve the test suite, improve the docs, ...</p>

<p><strong>A Party to Start All Parties<br /></strong></p>
<p>Starting June 15th and rolling all summer long, we’ll give communities and individuals around the world the resources to <em>celebrate the Open Web</em> together through meeting up, making cool stuff and teaching others.</p>
<p>With hundreds of events and activities already planned, from workshops to design sprints to code-a-thons to mashup sessions to father-daughter hackjams, and a bunch of freely-available tools like <a href=\"http://popcorn.webmaker.org\" target=\"_blank\">Popcorn</a>, <a href=\"http://thimble.webmaker.org\" target=\"_blank\">Thimble and </a><a href=\"http://hackasaurus.org/en-US/goggles/\" target=\"_blank\">X-Ray Goggles</a>, Maker Party will be the moment of the summer for community-driven inspiration amongst aspiring and veteran makers alike. —></p>
<p><strong>A Big Opportunity for Creative Makers</strong></p>
<p>For the <em>creatively inclined partiers amongst us, </em>whether you’re a maker or a mentor, Mozilla’s  Webmaker Content Team (we’re a <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/113102647862445788660\" target=\"_blank\">small but enthusiastic group</a> of folk) offers an additional opportunity to step up, get your work featured and become a source of inspiration for makers across the Web. We want to see your best Makes on Thimble and Popcorn, your craziest Maker Party ideas and your most irresistible-to-share remixes — and we want to share them with potential and veteran makers across the globe!</p>
<p><strong>How To Get Your Makes Featured</strong></p>
<p>To give the best Makes the attention they deserve, we’ll crawl through the Maker Party world each day to find the next best thing — so if you have a great Make ready for sharing, let us know by tagging it with the hashtag <em>#webmakerwin</em> on Tumblr, Twitter, Popcorn or Thimble. Details on each type of submission are below:</p>
<ul><li>On <strong>Thimble</strong>, add the line <meta content=”webmakerwin” name=”webmaker:tags”> to the <meta> part of your page HTML (this should be somewhere at the top!)</li>
<li>On <strong>Popcorn</strong>, tag the project “webmakerwin” under the ‘Publish’ tab when you save it</li>
<li>On <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>Tumblr</strong>, tweet the URL of your #makerparty Make using the tag #webmakerwin so we can find and RT it!</li>
</ul><p><strong>Contact Us + Join the Community</strong></p>
<p>Want a bit of mentoring, need help starting, or want to join the creative movement? We’ll be available throughout Maker Party for those who need a bit of creative inspiration in the form of <em>templates, example Makes, online tutorials and in-person Webmaker demo sessions.</em></p>
<p>To get in touch, join our community of creatives on the Mozilla <strong>IRC (Freenode) channel “#makesmiths”</strong> or on the <strong>G+ <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/113102647862445788660\" target=\"_blank\">Makesmiths</a> group</strong> and say hello.

interpose facilities for SPS. This feature will allow main thread I/O to be
displayed in the profiler UI.</p>
<p>There are a few components to this patch. Classes that implement the
<code>IOInterposerModule</code> interface are responsible for hooking into an arbitrary I/O
facility and calling into <code>IOInterposer</code> with those events.</p>
<p>The <code>IOInterposer</code> receives those events and then dispatches them to any registered
observers. For the purposes of SPS there is only one observer,
<code>ProfilerIOInterposeObserver</code>, however I wrote this keeping in mind that we
may eventually want to use the I/O interpose facilities for other purposes (such
as shutdown write poisioning).</p>
<p>For bug 867762 I have implemented two modules. <code>NSPRInterposer</code> hooks into NSPR
file I/O and generates events whenever a <code>PR_Read</code>, <code>PR_Write</code>, or <code>PR_Sync</code> occurs.
The second module, <code>SQLiteInterposer</code>, leverages the SQLite VFS that we use for
telemetry to tap into reads, writes, and fsyncs generated by SQLite. In the future
we expect to expand this into several additional modules. Some ideas include a module
that uses Event Tracing for Windows to read events from the Windows kernel and a
module that interposes calls to <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>fsync</code> on Linux.</p>
<p>On the observer side of things, for now we simply insert a marker into the profiler
timeline whenever main thread I/O is reported. Here is a sample screenshot of the
markers in action (the pink stuff for readers who are unfamiliar with SPS markers):</p>
<p><a href=\"http://dblohm7.ca/images/iomarkers.png\"><img src=\"http://dblohm7.ca/images/iomarkers.png\" /></a></p>
<p>In <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=867757\">bug 867757</a> (under review)
this will become more sophisticated, as SPS will immediately sample the callstack of
the thread whose I/O has been intercepted. This annotated stack will be inserted
directly into the timeline.</p>
<p>There will need to be some UI changes for this to be presented in a reasonable way,
but with both existing patches applied the data is already useful. By firing up
Cleopatra and filtering on either <code>NSPRInterposer</code> or <code>SQLiteInterposer</code>, you can
isolate and view the main thread I/O stacks:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://dblohm7.ca/images/iofilteredstacks.png\"><img src=\"http://dblohm7.ca/images/iofilteredstacks.png\" /></a></p>
<p>Hopefully these patches will prove to be beneficial to our efforts to eliminate
main thread I/O.</p>" nil nil "4cde6ba9de9efcb61ec21ad91ccfd5c3") (42 (20928 8795 699005) "http://robert.ocallahan.org/2013/06/meeting-absenteeism.html" "Robert O'Callahan: Meeting Absenteeism" "Robert" "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 23:39:42 +0000" "<p>I have a bad habit of missing meetings that I should (and want to) attend.

Sometimes I know about the meeting and I'm awake and working, but I get caught up in something and don't realize that the time has arrived. I use Google Calendar and GMail, and when people send time change notification emails Google Calendar adds them as new meetings instead of replacing the existing one, which sometimes confuses me about when the meeting is. I quite often quit and restart my browser, which means my Google Calendar tab often isn't really loaded and can't produce notifications. Most of my meetings are teleconferences of some kind, and sometimes I don't plan ahead and when I try to join the meeting, I find that Vidyo isn't working or some other technical problem prevents me from joining the meeting immediately.

The extent of this assistance is a topic of debate. What’s clear, though, is that the process itself is opaque: it’s impossible to know how broad or inappropriate the surveillance may be.</p>
<p>OK, so what do we do about it?</p>
<h4>told you so, never shoulda trusted the Cloud</h4>
<p>Some folks see this as vindication: we never should have trusted the Cloud. Only trust yourself, generate your own keypairs, encrypt all traffic, host your own email, etc. Servers are evil and should be considered leaky stupid passthroughs for fully encrypted data.</p>
<p>First, this is naive. If government agencies believe they have the authority to monitor all Internet traffic, would they hesitate to create viruses that infect and monitor endpoints? Would they hesitate to force software and hardware vendors to build secret backdoors into their products? It is the engineer’s mistake to believe that Law Enforcement will stop cleanly at technical abstraction layers. If the goal is total surveillance, the financial means immense, the arm-twisting strength unlimited, the oversight inexistent.. what would you do in their position?</p>
<p>Second, if, like me, you agree that technology experts have a duty to build solutions that matter to laypeople, it’s also irresponsible. None of these paranoid solutions are accessible to laypeople. Can you imagine Grandpa with his fingerprint-activated USB-key holding his RSA-2048-bit secret key and surfing the Web via Tor proclaiming “not me, I will fight the man!” Yeah. (And if you’re thinking “no Grandpa, not RSA! Elliptic curves!” well, thank you for making my point for me.)</p>
<p>So enough with this la-la land of users as fortified islands communicating via torpedo-proof-ciphertext-carrying submarines. <em>People engage with others by way of intermediaries they trust, for that is the basis of all human interaction and commerce since the dawn of time.</em> Let us build systems, both technical and legal, that start there.</p>
<h4>protect user data wherever it lives</h4>
<p>We can build systems that start with <em>respect for the user and her data, wherever it lives</em>. On Facebook servers, on Google servers, on self-hosted servers, on private computers. Encrypted or not encrypted. We can and should use cryptography to secure channels from those who would disrespect user data, reduce data collection to that which is useful, and generally build defense in depth against bad actors. We should stop wasting time on systems that impose the resulting complexity on users. Government access to user data should follow a clear, transparent process that is consistent wherever the data happens to be stored, however it happens to be encrypted.</p>
<p>Let’s build that system together. Not by barricading ourselves on our lonely islands of encryption and onion-routing. But by building <em>the legal and technical framework we need to respect users and their data</em>. <a href=\"https://optin.stopwatching.us/\">Mozilla</a> and <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/asking-us-government-to-allow-google-to.html\">Google</a> have started.

There are other articles out there that speak to what I’m about to say, but hey, I want to talk too and this is my article. Many voices.</p>
<p>As a designer, what an age we live in. People everywhere are coming online within social networks, blogs and other sites sharing ideas and inspiring the masses with a collective outpouring of creativity. As a designer, it is amazing to have the ability to play and be inspired by thousands upon thousands of my peers just by simply seeing their work tweeted or shared in a portfolio site online. What an awesome resource the Internet is for creativity and anyone first stepping into the design world.</p>
<p>As a designer, it is also terrifying.</p>
<p>Why would any designer out there want to become high enough profile in their profession that thousands or millions of people get to see their work? How badly would that person have to hate themselves to put up with the onslaught of feedback that can be defined simply as deconstructive? Maybe someone might think they ripped off another designer and their career would be over before it even started. Do they even have any original ideas or are they just interpretations of what others have already done? What if everyone hates their work? Wait… who is “everyone”?</p>
<p>I know, right? Frig that. I’m just going to stare at this wall for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Imposter syndrome is something lots of us are talking about these days. It leads to fear in one’s abilities, fear in being excited about your work, fear in the impact your work may have, fear in the lack of impact… self doubt is a huge gronk of a beast as a designer. So when I see current events like the deluge of hate towards the iOS 7 redesign or someone ripping apart #the #latest #design #story, I can’t help but think that all this deconstructive criticism and rage is simply unfiltered bullying. What else is it? Are these haters doing anything to offer guidance or help with any of the concerns they may have? No. Are these people at the very top of their field in design that they now know the One True Way to design a product, brand or piece of art? Mostly no, but sadly sometimes they are damn close and should know better. Do these haters actually care that there are individuals behind these designs and not just faceless companies? Again, in most cases, probably not.</p>
<p>Here’s something I learned over the years. The haters are the minority. They shout to be heard and unfortunately the haters sometimes become the majority in numbers within the feedback you do get. That is only because everyone else is just enjoying your work, or respects it enough to not offer criticism without purpose. If they over-the-moon love it, they’ll comment. If they want to offer constructive advice, they’ll comment. </p>
<p>So as a designer, what can you do?</p>
<p>Lead. Lead by example. Learn to love the helpers and ignore the haters. Inspire others, don’t belittle them. Be constructive, not destructive. Embrace fear. Allow the challenge of taming that fear to lead you to that amazing creative spark that everyone sees shining through the final piece. Love what you do, regardless of what others say. If you love your work, it shows. Don’t be afraid to show it off, but remain humble – allow some of that imposter syndrome to keep you in check so you’re not seen as a diva.</p>
<p>If you’re just beginning as a designer, be it through school or just as a side experience, welcome! Embrace any fears you may have because for the most part they stick around the whole way through your career. Love them and they’ll keep you humble and a designer others want to work with. You’ll find your place.</p>
<p>If you’re a designer now, I salute you. Keep all of this in mind and be sure to inspire, nurture, mentor, aid, encourage, all other designers. We’re not competition. We’re family. Don’t let a paycheque make you a hater.</p>
<p>As a designer, don’t be a bully. Just play.</p>" nil nil "18d894eac081976952d345f521107d68") (38 (20928 8795 696686) "http://home.kairo.at/blog/2013-06/linguistically_mistaking_phrases" "Robert Kaiser: Linguistically Mistaking Phrases" "KaiRo" "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 15:41:36 +0000" "I've been back from my vacation and the <a href=\"http://home.kairo.at/blog/2013-05/preserving_software_feedback_requested\">Preserving Software</a> summit at the Library of Congress for more than a week now, but still haven't blogged about anything, and I recently didn't blog too much at all, mostly because I always fear it takes up too much time. In the last few days, I decided I'll do shorter posts but do them more often, so I hopefully get to communicate more of what's going around in my head (thoughts on that summit will follow as well when I get around to them). Here's the first installment of this, let's see how it goes.<br />
<br />
I just listened to a <a href=\"https://air.mozilla.org/fireside-chat-3/\">\"Fireside Chat\"</a> (sorry, only available to Mozillians) with <a href=\"https://brendaneich.com/\">Brendan Eich</a>, conducted by <a href=\"http://blog.finette.com/\">Pascal Finette</a>. One thing that did strike me there was the use of two phrases, by each of them, and their chances of being mistaken from the point of view of English/German crossover.<br />
<br />
Pascal, a native German (his accent gives that away as well), is using \"a couple\" (e.g. \"of times\", etc.) in many questions in this interview. Now, the interesting thing there is that in German, we're using \"ein paar\" (which literally translates to \"a couple\") a lot, usually meaning \"an undetermined amount larger than one but smaller than 'a lot'\". We are very tempted to use this the same way in English, as it comes very naturally to us - but in US English, I notice that \"a couple\" usually means \"(more or less) exactly two\", so when we mean \"some probably between 4 and 7 times\", we may end up saying \"a couple times\" and the US English native speaker understands \"twice\". Oops. We better had said \"a few times\". I learned this in detail when I requested to stay \"a couple weeks\" in the office around a work week and thought there would be later discussion of how many weeks exactly, when the other side was \"OK, he wants two weeks, he'll get two weeks\". Note that in German there is \"ein Paar\" (different capitalization) which means the same as \"a couple\", but in most cases we just say \"zwei\"/\"two\" so it can't be mistaken.<br />
<br />
On the other side, Brendan starts the reply to some questions with \"that's a good question\" - which, as I learned over the years, is a usual phrase to compliment the person the question came from and say that this is an important issue to ask and talk about. Now, in German, this literally translates to \"das ist eine gute Frage\" - which we usually say when we recognize that it's an interesting question but we still need to think about this and don't have any really fitting answer, often coming up with one as we go on this. If you're a native German speaker, be aware that English speakers don't usually have that connotation to this phrase, actually they're often happy someone asked this because it's something they have thought about long and hard and have come up with a really good answer for already. If you're not a German speaker, be aware that those who are might understand it this way and be surprised or take your answer as weaker instead of stronger as you intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure there's tons of other misunderstandings between phrases in different languages for sure, I'm mentioning those two because I heard them in this \"chat\", it's (the) two languages I know quite well, and they're even in the same language family (in linguistics called \"Germanic languages\") - and still run into things like that.<br />
I'm always interested about such nuances, if you have any to share, feel free to comment here or blog about them yourself, here in this global Mozilla community, it's always nice to learn from each other! <img alt=\":)\" class=\"icon\" src=\"http://home.kairo.at/?d=b&p=s_smile\" style=\"height: 19px; width: 19px;\" title=\"smile\" />" nil nil "98b725ad153c3949082c8582b10a4629") (37 (20928 8795 695806) "http://playingwithsid.blogspot.com/2013/06/african-network-for-localization-anloc.html" "Arky: African Network For Localization (ANLoc) Conference 2013" "Arky r" "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 10:53:27 +0000" "<p>Traveled to Johannesburg, South Africa, to attend <a href=\"http://www.africanlocalisation.net/terminology-and-localisation-africa-and-beyond\" title=\"Terminology and Localization in Africa and beyond\">African Network For Localization (ANLoc)'s Terminology and Localisation in Africa and Beyond Conference</a> earlier this year.

<p>Randell Jesup <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=872978\">fixed a leak in WebRTC code</a>.</p>
<h3>Changes to these progress reports</h3>
<p>I’ve written over sixty MemShrink progress reports in the past two years.  When I started writing them, I had two major goals.  First, to counter the notion that nobody at Mozilla cares about memory consumption — this was a common comment on tech blogs two years ago.  Second, to keep interested people informed of MemShrink progress.</p>
<p>At this point, I think the first goal has been comprehensively addressed.  (More due to the  fact that we actually have improved Firefox’s memory consumption than because I wrote a bunch of blog posts!)  As a result, I feel like the value of these posts has diminished.  I’m also tired of writing them;  long-time readers may have noticed that they are much terser than they used to be.</p>
<p>Therefore, going forward, I’m only going to post one report every four weeks.  (The MemShrink team will still meet every two weeks, however.)  I’ll also be more selective about what I write about — I’ll focus on the big improvements, and I won’t list every little leak that has been fixed, though I might post links to Bugzilla searches that list those fixes. Finally, I won’t bother recording the MemShrink bug counts.  (In fact, I’ve started that today.)  At this point it’s pretty clear that the P1 list hovers between 15 and 20 most of the time, and the P2 and P3 lists grow endlessly.</p>
<p>Apologies to anyone disappointed by this, but rest easy that it will give me more time to work on actual improvements to Firefox <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>" nil nil "78bd6a1b2833db672fd9ee0e10265f40") (34 (20928 8795 691040) "http://msujaws.wordpress.com/2013/06/11/animating-and-transitioning-displaynone-elements/" "Jared Wein: Animating and transitioning display:none elements" "msujaws" "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 03:45:23 +0000" "<p>The current release of Firefox introduces a nice animation when opening and closing the Find bar. Upon opening the Find bar, the toolbar fades in and slides up. Exiting the toolbar will make it fade out and slide down.</p>
<p>As you may or may not know, the user interface for Firefox is implemented using XUL+HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>
<p>We use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/XUL/Attribute/hidden\">the XUL <code>hidden</code> attribute</a>, which is very similar to the <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/global-attributes.html#common.attrs.hidden\">HTML5 <code>hidden</code> attribute</a>, to hide the Find bar when it is dismissed. The presence of the <code>hidden</code> attribute sets <code>display:none</code> on the referenced element. If you’ve ever played around with CSS Transitions or Animations, you’ve probably noticed that <code>display</code> is not a transitionable property.</p>
<p>To maintain add-on compatibility, as well as code simplicity, we wanted to keep using the <code>hidden</code> attribute. Doing so also allowed us to leave the JavaScript unchanged.</p>
<p>This poses a hard problem. If <code>display</code> is not transitionable, how could we animate the behavior here? It turns out that <code>visibility</code> is a transitionable property.</p>
<p>The various states of <code>visibility</code> are atomic. There is no defined behavior for what should happen when an element transitions from <code>visibility:hidden</code> to <code>visibility:visible</code> or <code>visibility:collapse</code>. However, we can use a zero second duration to make the change happen at the instant that we want.</p>
<p>This brings us to our solution:</p>
<pre>findbar {
transition-property: margin-bottom, opacity, visibility;
transition-duration: 150ms, 150ms, 0s;
transition-timing-function: ease-in-out, ease-in-out, linear;
margin-bottom: 0;
opacity: 1;
}
findbar[hidden] {
/* Override display:none to make the transition work. */
display: -moz-box;
visibility: collapse;
margin-bottom: -1em;
opacity: 0;
transition-delay: 0s, 0s, 150ms;
}</pre>
<p>To explain how this works we’ll start by looking at <code>findbar[hidden]</code>, since it’s the default state for the Find bar.</p>
<p>When it is hidden, we will force it to be displayed (using <code>display:-moz-box</code>, which is an internal-to-Gecko <code>display</code> value, you could replace this with <code>display:block</code> or <code>display:inline</code> as needed). We then set <code>visibility</code> to <code>collapse</code>, which will effectively make the element invisible and also not consume any space (except for margins, which is important here). We then use a negative <code>margin-bottom</code> to force the element to be placed just out of view of the browser window. Setting <code>opacity</code> here is used to fade the element in and out. I’ll describe the <code>transition-delay</code> last.</p>
<p>When the Find bar is shown, we set <code>margin-bottom</code> to zero which will slide the toolbar up. We also set <code>opacity</code> to one which will make it fade in. The opposite happens in reverse when the Find bar is dismissed.</p>
<p>The key here is the <code>transition-delay</code> that is set in the <code>findbar[hidden]</code> case.</p>
<p>When the Find bar is hidden and transitions to being visible, we don’t have a <code>transition-delay</code> applied. This causes the <code>visibility</code> to change immediately at the beginning of the animation. The Find bar becomes visible and then it slides and fades in to view.</p>
<p>When the Find bar is visible and transitions to being hidden, we delay changing the <code>visibility</code> until the <code>margin</code> and <code>opacity</code> transitions have completed. Running the <code>visibility</code> transition immediately in this case would cause the element to disappear instantly, which would ruin the animation.</p>
<p>That explains how I implemented the Find bar transition in Firefox without affecting themes or having to change JS. It’s a pretty cool technique for showing and hiding elements, and has opened the doors to implementing some other types of animations in the Firefox user interface. Let me know what you think! <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I’ve been told by <a href=\"http://frankyan.com/\">Frank Yan</a> that this won’t work on non-XUL content since <code>display:-moz-box</code> is needed to get the <code>visibility:collapse</code> to work as needed. Still a cool technique to see!</p>

connection between <em>memory management</em> and <em>data-race freedom</em>. I want
to take a moment to elaborate on this, becaause the connection was not
obvious to me at first, but it ultimately drives a lot of the Rust
design decisions.</p>
<p>First, I believe that if you want to guarantee data-race freedom, and
you want to support the cheap transfer of mutable state between tasks,
then you must have a garbage-collector-free subset of your
language. To see what I mean by “cheap transfer of mutable state”,
consider something like double-buffering: you have one drawing and one
display task exchanging buffers (so there are only two buffers in
total).  While the drawing task is preparing the next frame, the
display task is busy displaying the current one. At the end, they
exchange buffers.  In order to prevent data races in a scenario like
this, it is vital that we be able to guarantee that when the buffers
are exchanged, neither task has any remaining references. Otherwise,
the display task would be able to read or write from the buffer that
the drawing task is currently writing on.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if we wanted to <em>free</em> one of those buffers, rather
than send it to another task, the necessary safety guaranty would be
precisely the same: we must be able to guarantee that there are no
existing aliases. Therefore, if you plan to support a scenario like
double buffering <em>and guarantee data-race freedom</em>, then you have
exactly the same set of problems to solve that you would have if you
wanted to make GC optional. Of course, you could still use a GC to
<em>actually free</em> the memory, but there is no reason to, you’re just
giving up performance. Most languages opt to give up on data-race
freedom at this point. Rust does not.</p>
<p>But there is a deeper connection than this. I’ve often thought that
while data-races in a technical sense can only occur in a parallel
system, problems that <em>feel</em> a lot like data races crop up all the
time in sequential systems. One example would be what C++ folk call
<em>iterator invalidation</em>—basically, if you are iterating over a
hashtable and you try to modify the hashtable during that iteration,
you get undefined behavior. Sometimes your iteration skips keys or
values, sometimes it shows you the new key, sometimes it doesn’t, etc.
In C++, this leads to crashes. In Java, this (hopefully) leads to an
exception.</p>
<p>But whatever the outcome, iterator invalidation feels very similar to
a data race. The problem often arises because you have one piece of
code iterating over a hashtable and then calling a subroutine defined
over in some other module. This other module then writes to the same
hashtable.  Both modules look fine on their own, it’s only the
combination of the two that causes the issue. And because of the
undefined nature of the result, it often happens that the code works
fine for a long time—until it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Rust’s type system prevents iterator invalidation. Often this can be
done statically. But if you use <code>@mut</code> types, that is, mutable managed
data, we do the detection dynamically. Even in the dynamic case, the
guarantee that you get is much stronger than what Java gives with
fail-fast iteration: Rust guarantees failure, and in fact it even
points at the two pieces of code that are conflicting (though if you
build optimized, we can only provide you with one of those locations,
since tracking the other causes runtime overhead right now).</p>
<p>One reason that we are so intolerant towards iterator invalidation is
because we wish to guarantee memory safety, and we wish to do so
without the use of universal garbage collection (since, as I just
argued before, it is basically unnecessary if you also guarantee
data-race freedom). Without a garbage collector, iterator invalidation
can lead to dangling pointers or other similar problems. But even
<em>with</em> a garbage collector, iterator invalidation leads to undefined
behavior, which can in turn imply that your browser can be compromised
by code that can exploit that behavior. So it’s an all-around bad
thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think it is no accident that the same type-system tools
that combat iterator invalidation wind up being
<a href=\"http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/06/11/data-parallelism-in-rust/\">useful to fight data-races</a>. Essentially I believe these are two
manifestations of the same problem—unexpected aliasing—in one
case, expressed in a parallel setting, and in the other, in a
sequential setting. The sequential case is mildly simpler, in that in
a sequential setting you at least have a happens-before relationship
between any two pairs of accesses, which does not hold in a parallel
setting.  This is why we tolerate <code>&const</code> and <code>&mut</code> aliases in
sequential code, but forbid them with closure bounds in parallel code.</p>
<p>In some way this observation is sort of banal. Of course mutating
without knowledge of possible aliases gets you into trouble. But I
think it’s also profound, in a way, because it suggests that these two
seemingly unrelated issues, memory management and data races, cannot
be truly separated (except by sacrificing mutability).</p>
<p>Most languages make no effort to control aliasing; if anything, they
use universal garbage collection to prevent the end user from having
to reason about when aliasing might exist to a given piece of
data. This works well for guaranteeing memory is not freed, but as
I’ve suggested, it can lead to a variety of incorrect behaviors if
mutation is permitted.</p>
<p>This observation has motivated a lot of the research into ownership
types and linear types, research which Rust draws on. Of other recent
non-research languages, the only other that I know which takes the
approach of controlling aliasing is <a href=\"http://parasail-programming-language.blogspot.com/\">Parasail</a>. Not
coincidentally, I would argue, both Rust and Parasail guarantee
data-race freedom, while most langauges do not.</p>" nil nil "bb8edfe19ee297590a885400ef9dea26") (31 (20928 8795 688496) "https://blog.mozilla.org/vdjeric/2013/06/11/performance-update-issue-3/" "Vladan Djeric: Performance Update, Issue #3" "Vladan Djeric" "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 18:00:12 +0000" "<p><em>This is a post summarizing the activities of the Performance team over the past week.

actors which exchange messages and do not share memory. However, there
are many tasks for which actors are not a good fit. The unbounded
lifetime of actors means that they cannot safely access
stack-allocated memory from another task, even if it is
immutable. Actors cannot share memory except through the relatively
clumsy (and somewhat expensive) mechanism of <code>Arc</code> structures (which
stands for “atomic reference count”), meaning that if there are large
data structures they can be a pain to access. <code>Arc</code> is also
inapplicable to data structures that transition between mutable and
immutable and back again.</p>
<p>I was recently pointed to the paper
<a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1953616\">“Three layer cake for shared-memory programming”</a>, which
describes perfectly the direction in which I would like to see Rust
go. Message passing is retained at the top-level, but within an actor,
you have support for fork-join concurrency. I’ve been calling these
fork-join tasks “jobs”. Within a job, you can get yet more concurrency
via SIMD primitives.</p>
<p>To that end, I’ve been working on promising design for fork-join
concurrency in Rust. I am very pleased both because the API looks like
it will be simple, flexible, and easy to use, and because we are able
to statically guarantee data-race freedom <em>even with full support for
shared memory</em> with only minimal, generally applicable modifications
to the type system (closure bounds, a few new built-in traits). The
scheme also requires no changes to the runtime; it can be implemented
simply as a library.</p>
<p>In particular, the existing borrow checker rules, which were aimed at
preventing dangling pointers, turn out to be extremely well-suited to
this task.  I find this very interesting and very heartening as well,
and I think it points to a kind of deeper analogy between memory
errors in sequential programs and data races in parallel programs.
I will elaborate on this theory in a later post.</p>
<h3>The API</h3>
<p>The API is based on a fork-join model. There are a number of helper
functions, each of which starts up a number of parallel jobs and
returns when those jobs have completed. The API builds on Rust’s type
system to statically guarantee data-race freedom. Under typical usage,
in fact, the API even guarantees deterministic results, though this
guarantee can be voided by making use of locks, ports, and certain
other advanced types.</p>
<p>I have adopted the term <code>job</code> to distinguish the lightweight parallel
tasks that from Rust’s normal tasks. Although both can be used for
parallel execution, they are quite different in most other respects.
For example, jobs all share the same memory space as their parent
task, whereas tasks are strictly isolated from one another.  Jobs also
have a fixed lifetime, whereas tasks run asynchronously. In general,
executing a parallel job is supposed to act exactly as though the text
of that job were inlined into the task body, modulo certain observable
timing differences (and nondeterminism around locks and message
ordering).</p>
<p>To some extent, the API that I’m going to discuss is a strawman.
Expect changes to the details, of course. Also, I only present the
primitive operations here; there will be a number of higher-level
wrappers for common operations (like parallel map and reduce and so
forth). In keeping with the <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1953616\">“three layer cake”</a> idea, these
higher-level primitives may employ SIMD as well.</p>
<h4>Parallel execute</h4>
<p>The most primitive method in Parallel arsenal is <code>parallel::execute(jobs)</code>,
which takes an array of closures and executes the closures in parallel
jobs (well, at least potentially—it may opt to run them sequentially
if insufficient parallel resources exist). Once these jobs complete,
<code>execute()</code> returns.</p>
<p>These closures are permitted to share memory and capture values by
reference.  We will see later that the type checker will validate that
if one of these jobs writes to a particular value, then none of the
other jobs can access it; you are allowed however to access the same
data so long as all jobs treat it as immutable.</p>
<p>To make the usage more concrete, here is an example that uses
<code>parallel::execute</code> to sum up the values in a binary tree in parallel.
Note that no heap allocation is required at any point in the
iteration, which is nice from a performance point of view.</p>
<pre><code>struct Tree {
val: uint,
left: Option<~Tree>,
right: Option<~Tree>,
}
fn sum_tree(tree: &Tree) -> uint {
let mut left_sum = 0;
let mut right_sum = 0;
parallel::execute([
|| left_sum = sum_opt_tree(&tree.left),
|| right_sum = sum_opt_tree(&tree.right),
]);
left_sum + right_sum + tree.val
}
fn sum_opt_tree(tree: &Option<~Tree>) -> uint {
match tree {
Some(~ref t) => sum_tree(t),
None => 0,
}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The type of <code>execute()</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>fn execute(jobs: &[fn:Isolate()])
</code></pre>
<p>Here the <code>fn:Isolate()</code> means “a closure that only closes over state
that is either shared or isolated from other threads”. I’ll explain
this bound and the other details of static safety checking shortly.</p>
<h4>Parallel divide</h4>
<p>The other primitive parallel operation is <code>divide()</code>, which takes a
mutable slice and a closure. It will divide up the slice into a number
of subslices and invoke your closure on it; the precise means that it
uses to divide the subslice is unspecified. You can also configure
<code>divide()</code> with the minimum granularity that it should use when dividing
the array (for example, you might prefer to be called back with
subslices that are a multiple of 10 items).</p>
<p>In a way, <code>execute()</code> is more fundamental than <code>divide()</code>, as you can
implement <code>divide()</code> using <code>execute()</code> by recursively dividing the array
in half. However, I choose to call <code>divide()</code> a second primitive because
it can be far more efficient to divide the array using other
strategies, such as determining how many worker threads are available
and just chopping the slice into <code>N</code> equal parts (of course this will
depend on the workload).</p>
<p>The reason that <code>divide()</code> provides you with a mutable subslice, rather
than say a pointer to an individual element, is that often there is
setup work that can be shared between consecutive elements when
processing an array. Consider the following example, which treates a
vector <code>v</code> as a 2d array, and invokes the closure <code>f</code> in parallel with
each element in the array and its <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinate. In this
case, the initial computation of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> from the index in <code>v</code> is
relatively expensive, as it requires division, but updating <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> is very cheap. Using <code>divide()</code>, the initial division can be
amortized over a large subslice.</p>
<pre><code>fn update_two_dim<T>(v: &mut [T],
width: uint,
f: fn:Share(&mut T, x: uint, y: uint)) {
assert!(v.len() % width == 0);
do parallel::divide(array, 1) |slice, offset| {
let mut (x, y) = (offset % width, offset / width);
for slice.each_mut |p| {
update(p, x, y);
x += 1;
if x == width {
x = 0;
y += 1;
}
}
}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The type of <code>divide()</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>fn divide<T>(data: &mut [T],
granularity: uint,
job: fn:Share(&mut [T], uint))
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll note that the type of the closure is different from
<code>execute()</code>. Whereas before we had <code>fn:Isolate</code>, for <code>divide()</code> we
have <code>fn:Share</code>. This is in fact a tighter bound that only permits
content that can safely be accessed in parallel by multiple
threads. The difference is due to the fact that, with <code>execute()</code>,
each closure got its own parallel job, but with <code>divide()</code>, the same
closure will be called simultaneously from multiple jobs.</p>
<h3>Checking safety</h3>
<p>So how can we guarantee that these APIs are used safely? For example,
what ensures that the user doesn’t write a program like this one (variations
on this example will serve as examples through this section):</p>
<pre><code>fn compute_foo_and_bar(dataset: &[uint]) -> (uint, uint) {
let mut foo = 0;
let mut bar = 0;
parallel::execute([
|| foo = compute_foo(dataset),
|| foo = compute_bar(dataset), // <-- Bug here!
]);
(foo, bar)
}
fn compute_foo(dataset: &[uint]) -> uint { ... }
fn compute_bar(dataset: &[uint]) -> uint { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the function <code>compute_foo_and_bar()</code> creates two
closures, one of which creates <code>compute_foo()</code> and one of which
invokes <code>compute_bar()</code>. The two closures run in parallel.  However,
there is a slight bug: both closures write to <code>foo</code>, though presumably
the author meant for the second closure to write to <code>bar</code>. Therefore,
this program will be rejected as racy: let’s see how the borrow
checker comes to that conclusion.</p>
<h4>Desugaring closures</h4>
<p>In fact, this conclusion falls out of the normal borrow checker safety
rules for closures (more accurately, it <em>will</em> fall out of those rules
once I fix them).  The way the borrow checker handles closures is
essentially to “desugar” them into the pair of a struct that contains
pointers and a fn pointer.  To see what, let’s examine the first
closure from our example in more detail:</p>
<pre><code>|| foo = compute_foo(dataset)
</code></pre>
<p>If we wanted to model this closure more precisely, we could
consider it as the pair of an environment struct and a function.
It would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>struct FooEnv {
foo: &mut uint,
dataset: &[uint]
}
fn foo_fn(env: &mut TheEnv) {
*env.foo = compute_foo(env.dataset);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This means that the call to <code>parallel::execute</code> would look something
like this:</p>
<pre><code>parallel::execute([
// Roughly equivalent to `|| foo = compute_foo(dataset)`
(&FooEnv {foo: &mut foo, dataset: dataset}, foo_fn),
// Roughly equivalent to `|| bar = compute_bar(dataset)`
(&BarEnv {bar: &mut foo, dataset: dataset}, bar_fn),
])
</code></pre>
<p>This is in fact the kind of code that gets generated at runtime.  The
interesting thing about looking at closure creations this way is that
we can apply the standard Rust borrowing rules to them. In particular,
we see that there are two mut borrows of the variable <code>foo</code>, and those
borrows have overlapping lifetimes, which is not permitted.</p>
<h4>The role of closure bounds</h4>
<p>As the previous example showed, the borrow checker’s normal rules
already gives us many of the guarantees we require. We covered
specifically how the borrow checker handles closures, but in general
the borrow check guarantees that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&mut T</code> pointers are the <em>only way</em> to modify the memory that they
point at (thus guaranteeing that if job A has an <code>&mut</code> pointer,
no other job can be writing that memory);</li>
<li><code>&T</code> pointers are <em>immutable</em> (thus guaranteeing that if job A has a
<code>&T</code> pointer, no job can be writing to that memory).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are several guarantees that the borrow checker does
<em>not</em> provide which are unnecessary in a sequential context but become
important when discussing data races:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although <code>&mut T</code> pointers are the only way to <em>mutate</em> the memory
they point at, they are not the only way to <em>read</em> the memory they
point at. Both <code>&const T</code> and <code>@mut T</code> can produce read-only
aliases; thus is one job holds an <code>&mut T</code> and another an <code>&const
T</code>, the two jobs could race.</li>
<li>The Rust standard library includes a number of types that include
“interior mutability”, meaning mutability inherent in the type
itself, vs imposed from the outside. Examples are <code>@mut</code>, <code>RcMut</code>,
and <code>Cell</code>. Many of these types are not threadsafe, with the notable
exception of <code>RwArc</code>, which employs mutual exclusion.</li>
<li>Managed pointers like <code>@T</code> and <code>@mut T</code> are currently not safe
to pass between parallel jobs, though in the case of <code>@T</code> this is
an implementation limitation and not a theoretical one.</li>
</ul>
<p>What all this means is that if the <code>parallel::execute()</code> accepted an
array of any old closures, it could be sure that those closures would
not race on any <code>&mut T</code> or <code>&T</code> values that they may have access to,
but races could arise if those closures had access to <code>&const T</code>
values (not to mention <code>@mut T</code>, <code>Cell</code>, and so on).</p>
<p>There is a similar danger for <code>parallel::divide()</code>. Unlike
<code>execute()</code>, which accepts an array of closures and executes each one
from its own parallel job, <code>divide()</code> accepts a single closure and it
invokes that same closure many times in parallel. This means that if
the closure were close over an <code>&mut</code> pointer, that <em>same pointer</em>
would be available to many threads, and thus races could arise.</p>
<h5>Enter closure bounds</h5>
<p>We prevent both of these scenarios with <em>closure bounds</em>. A closure
bound is a limitation on the kinds of values that a closure can
contain in its environment. This is directly analogous to the bounds
that appear on type parameters in generic functions. For example,
if we declare a generic function <code>f</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>fn f<T:Freeze>(v: &[T]) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>The bound <code>:Freeze</code> on <code>T</code> indicates that <code>T</code> may only be used with
values that are freezable (which means “no interior mutability”, so
e.g. <code>@mut</code> and <code>Cell</code> are excluded). Similarly, the type
<code>fn:Freeze()</code> would indicate a function whose environment contained
only freezable values.</p>
<p>As currently planned, closure bounds are less general than the
bounds which appear on type parameters, in that they are limited to
the “built-in” traits like <code>Freeze</code> and <code>Send</code>. These traits differ
from other traits in that they offer no methods and you never explicitly
implement them. The traits are used to describe properties of the data
in question, like whether it may be mutable, and the compiler just
decides automatically whether a given type belongs to this trait or
not. Normally, the compiler would never consider a closure type <code>fn()</code>
to be a member of such a trait, because it does not know what data the
closure contains, but this does not necessarily apply to bounded
closure types.  For example, the type <code>fn:Freeze()</code> is itself a member
of <code>Freeze</code>.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the future we can extend closure bounds to arbitrary
traits. For example, a type like <code>fn:Eq()</code> might permit deep
comparison of closure environments, or <code>fn:Clone()</code> could permit deep
cloning.  I haven’t thought deeply about this, though, and it would
presumably require some sort of <code>impl</code> based on reflection.</p>
<h5>Closure bounds apply to “desugared” environments</h5>
<p>One thing that is not entirely obvious is that closure bounds refer to
the <em>desugared references</em> found in a closure environment. Recall
that a closure like <code>|| foo = compute_foo(dataset)</code> in fact desugars
to an environment where <code>foo</code> is represented as an <code>&mut</code> pointer:</p>
<pre><code>struct FooEnv {
foo: &mut uint,
dataset: &[uint]
}
</code></pre>
<p>This means that such a closure would not be considered to meet the bound
<code>Freeze</code>, because in its environment the field <code>foo</code> is an <code>&mut</code>
pointer, which is not freezable. This is true even though the type of
the <em>variable</em> <code>foo</code> is just <code>uint</code>, which does meet <code>Freeze</code>.</p>
<p>As a side-effect, a closure of type <code>fn:Send()</code> can only exist as a
coercion from an environment-less function, since any true closure
will have borrowed pointers of <em>some kind</em> in its environment, and
they are not sendable.</p>
<p><em>Hat tip</em>: Promising Young Intern <a href=\"http://winningraceconditions.blogspot.com/\">bblum</a> first expressed this
view of closure bounds. It is much cleaner than the formulation I had
before, which included some ad-hoc rules to achieve the same effect.</p>
<h5><code>execute</code> and the <code>Isolate</code> bound</h5>
<p>You may recall that the <code>parallel::execute()</code> fn was declared as <code>fn
execute(jobs: &[fn:Isolate()])</code>. As the type indicates, it accepts an
array of closures that carry the <code>Isolate</code> bound. The <code>Isolate</code> bound
accepts “all values that can be transmitted and isolated to a single
parallel job”, which in practice means:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&mut T</code> where <code>T:Isolate</code></li>
<li><code>&T</code> where <code>T:Isolate</code></li>
<li>Scalar values like <code>uint</code>, <code>int</code>, etc</li>
<li>Structs, tuples, and enums if all components can be isolated,
and the types are not internally mutable</li>
<li>The “atomic ref count” type <code>Arc</code></li>
<li>The “mutex” type <code>RwArc</code></li>
<li>Closures that can be isolated (i.e., <code>fn:Isolate(T1, T2) -> T3</code>, where
<code>T1</code>, <code>T2</code>, and <code>T3</code> need not meet any bound in particular)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this list excludes both <code>&const T</code> and <code>@mut T</code>, as well as
types like <code>Cell</code>, <code>Rc</code>, and <code>RcMut</code> that employ internal mutation.
The list still includes a number of mutable types, however:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&mut T</code> is safe because, as discussed previously, if one closure has
access to an <code>&mut T</code>, then none of the other closures has access
to that same value.</li>
<li><code>Arc</code> is safe because its reference counters are maintained atomically.</li>
<li><code>RwArc</code> is safe because it uses a mutex to guarantee that any
mutation which occurs is always threadsafe.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Isolate</code> bound excludes all managed data. More discussion on this
topic is found below.</p>
<h5><code>divide</code> and the <code>Share</code> bound</h5>
<p>The <code>divide</code> function is declared as follows:</p>
<pre><code>fn divide<T:Isolate>(data: &mut [T],
granularity: uint,
job: fn:Share(&mut [T], uint))
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>job</code> closure requires the <code>Share</code> bound, which
specifies data that can be safely shared amongst many parallel jobs
(meaning, the same value can be accessed simultaneously by many jobs
at once). The data that is being divided only requires the <code>Isolate</code>
bound, since that data will never be accessible to multiple jobs at a
time.</p>
<p>The definition of <code>Share</code> is a subset of <code>Isolate</code> that excludes <code>&mut</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&T</code> where <code>T:Share</code></li>
<li>Scalar values like <code>uint</code>, <code>int</code>, etc</li>
<li>Structs, tuples, and enums if all components can be shared,
and the types are not internally mutable</li>
<li>The “atomic ref count” type <code>Arc</code></li>
<li>The “mutex” type <code>RwArc</code></li>
<li>Closures that can be shared (i.e., <code>fn:Share(T1, T2) -> T3</code>, where
<code>T1</code>, <code>T2</code>, and <code>T3</code> need not meet any bound in particular)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that it is still safe to share <code>RwArc</code> (the mutex type).</p>
<h5>Relationship of <code>Isolate</code> and <code>Share</code> to existing bounds</h5>
<p>Rust already has two “built-in” bounds, <code>Freeze</code> and <code>Send</code>, which are
both somewhat more strict that <code>Isolate</code> and <code>Share</code> (<code>Freeze</code>, for
example, would reject <code>RwArc</code>, and <code>Send</code> would reject all <code>&T</code> or
<code>@T</code> values). I think the full hierarchy is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Isolate
Share
Freeze
Send
</code></pre>
<p>Here the indentation is intended to indicate an inclusion
relationship.  In other words, anything that meets <code>Send</code> or <code>Freeze</code>
meets both <code>Isolate</code> and <code>Share</code>, but not vice versa. Similarly,
anything that meets <code>Share</code> meets <code>Isolate</code>, but not vice versa.</p>
<h4>Extending to permit sharing of managed data</h4>
<p>In general we can implement a minimal version of this scheme with no
changes to the runtime. The parallel job dispatching can be
implemented as a library building on the existing scheduler. Unsafe
code would be used to “leak” the closures outside of one task and into
another. This is safe because we know that parent thread will be
blocking, and thus the stack-allocated closures will remain valid;
data-race-freedom is then guaranteed by the mechanisms I have already
discussed. Once the jobs are executed over on the tasks, messages are
sent back and the <code>execute</code> or <code>divide</code> function returns and permits
the main thread to resume executing.</p>
<p>If we wanted to allow <code>@T</code> values to be passed to parallel jobs, we
would have to make some deeper changes. First, this is incompatible
with the non-atomic reference counting and cycle collection mechanism
we use today. Even when we move to a tracing collector, though, we
will have to generalize the collector to permit multiple parallel jobs
to access in parallel. This is still a more limited setting than a
full-on cross-process garbage collector, as you find in JVMs, but it
will nonetheless add significant complexity. Similar issues arise in
PJS; I have a blog post coming out soon that will discuss some of our
plans in that regard, most of which apply equally to Rust, though not
entirely, because the Rust model is more general than PJS.</p>
<p>Note that nothing prevents parallel jobs from allocating and using
<code>@T</code> and other values internally. This is fine; we are guaranteed that
these values cannot outlive the parallel job because the closure
cannot closure over any location that could store such values, and the
closure argument and return types must always meet the <code>Isolate</code>
bound.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This post summarizes my current thinking about how to achieve
ligher-weight data parallelism in Rust. The critical differences
between the <em>parallel jobs</em> described here and the existing tasks are
that <em>jobs</em> would have access to borrowed pointers and thus to data
found in the stack frame and even, to some extent, managed heap of the
parent task. Jobs would always have a fixed lifetime and follow a
fork-join pattern. Parallel jobs as I describe form the “second layer”
in the <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1953616\">“three layer cake” of parallel programming</a>, enabling
fork-join parallelism while retaining deterministic semantics (modulo
the use of <code>RwArc</code>). They can also form the basis for a number of
higher-level APIs and combine well with future extensions to support
SIMD.</p>" nil nil "baf7fecae4cca188d5c0b8a3ba13758d") (29 (20928 8795 683988) "https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2013/06/11/total-surveillance/" "Mitchell Baker: Total Surveillance" "mitchell" "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 15:13:43 +0000" "<p>Imagine you live in a world where the buildings are glass and you can’t ever close the curtains. Imagine the floor is glass, the ceiling is glass and all the walls are glass. There are no curtains, no window shades, no shutters and you can’t make your own. We’re heading into this world online. A robust network, cheap sensors and massive data manipulation builds the equivalent of glass houses.</p>
<p>The question today is whether we can have curtains. Whether any business or ecosystem provides curtains and whether we can make our own. Today we have very little ability to close the curtains in commercial activities. Websites are technically able to track *everything* we do, from how long we stay on a page to what ads attract us to how to travel from one website to the next. The data about you can be sold to others. Online data can be combined with data from your physical world and made available or sold to others  Telephone providers know when we make a phone call, where we made it from, who we called, how long we talked, our regular patterns of calls, and more.</p>
<p>Now we know that the U.S. government is gathering significant quantities of this data. Currently it’s understood to be using only “metadata” about phone calls for U.S. citizens, and to be using the actual content as well for foreign nationals. Now we also know that the inability to pull the curtains applies to governments as well.  We can also wonder how many other governments are collecting these types of data.</p>
<p>Now is the moment to ask — do we care?  Do care how much our government watches us, tracks us without our knowing it? Do we care how  the U.S. government treats the citizens of friendly, allied states? Do we care if other governments emulate the U.S. and gather this data?   How do businesses, organizations and individuals approach the US knowing the scope of online activities that are being monitored?  How much do other governments do this — either to  citizens or to foreign nationals?</p>
<div id=\"magicdomid66\">
<p>How do we balance between civil rights and national security?</p>
<p>At Mozilla we have a long, deep focus on individual control of online life, including the degree of privacy a person wants. We build products to promote this goal, and we will continue to do so. In essence, we try to provide the option of pulling the curtains for individual citizens.</p>
<p>However, products do not make government policies. This is the role of  citizens. We urge all citizens to get involved with the issue of wholesale government surveillance. It will determine the realities of  online life going forward.  Our online houses are become increasingly built of glass. Our lives our increasingly visible to whomever wants to look.</p>

<p>I was intrigued, answered Jack and got a second mail with the link to this video. I love it – it is a great example how to present research information in a short, informative and creative way. Whilst I am utterly tired of <a href=\"http://memebase.cheezburger.com/ragecomics\">rage comics</a> and consider them a massive waste of bandwidth and perceived creativity it makes sense to use them here to show what the research was about. I learned a few things, for example I did not know trolling came from fishing and that there were even trolls on ham radio in the past. The best, however is the advice at the end.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Trolling is not a game of solitaire. Unless we want to actively suppress freedom of speech, the only way to beat a troll is to not play the game.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>In other words – don’t feed the troll.</p>

It also brings up some of the more interesting questions. Let me explain:</p>
<p>Apple <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2013/\">announced</a> today that they paid out 10 billion USD to their iOS developers both through direct app sales as well as in-app purchases. 5 billion USD of those were paid out just last year (which points to accelerated growth of the iOS ecosystem). According to Apple this represents 74% of the total market for mobile phone app purchases (with Android accounting for 20% and others for the remaining 6%).</p>
<p>Further take into account that mobile phones are not only creating direct economic opportunity through their app stores but also enable numerous other forms of generated revenue and you get an interesting picture (e.g. e-commerce which originates from a mobile phone; eBay <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130116006423/en/eBay-Reports-Strong-Fourth-Quarter-Full-Year\">reported</a> 13 billion USD in gross merchandise sales going through their mobile app in 2012 alone).</p>
<p>Consider that Firefox OS plays a different game – both from a technical as well as a target market perspective (using the Web as the platform, thus being much more open and targeting emerging markets respectively) and the really fascinating question becomes: Outside of the obvious economic opportunities \"direct on-device commerce through app stores\" and mobile/e-commerce as well as content consumption (music, videos, books) – <strong>which other forms of economic opportunity can we enable and drive through the device?</strong> And in this context: What can we (Mozilla) do to foster and/or enable this?</p>
<p>We are already seeing interesting opportunities <em>especially</em> in emerging markets – from mobile banking for the previously unbanked (e.g. Safaricom's and Vodafone's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa\">M-Pesa</a>) to market information systems for farmers (using SMS messaging - e.g. Intuit's <a href=\"http://fasal.intuit.com/\">Fasal</a>) and much more.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that \"<em>we (mostly) don't know what we don't know</em>\". That this is likely one of the biggest opportunities we have with Firefox OS. And that it will mostly be the communities/entrepreneurs on the ground who will create and capture these opportunities.</p>
<p>The question remains: <strong>What can we, as Mozilla, do to inspire, enable, foster and grow these ventures? What is missing? What do we need to create to make this happen?</strong></p>

<h3 id=\"vsync\">Vsync</h3>
<p>Vsync has finally <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856427\">landed</a> on Windows Nightlies not long ago. This means that Firefox will now synchronize its paints with the actual refresh rate of the monitor (if available), which is essential for properly smooth animations. This will work (and is enabled by default) on Windows Vista and later with DWM enabled (“Aero” themes). This also works with WebGL content such as <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2013/05/02/epic-citadel-demo-shows-the-power-of-the-web-as-a-platform-for-gaming/\">Epic Citadel</a> (<a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">demo</a>).</p>
<p>Without vsync, Firefox uses 60hz refresh rate by default, which works relatively decently with 60hz displays, but fails badly at displaying properly smooth animations on monitors with other refresh rates (50hz on quite a few laptop displays, 100hz monitors, etc).</p>
<p>However, the current implementation synchronizes with the main display only, so if using a multi-monitor setup, Firefox windows on secondary monitors might not gain from this.</p>
<p>You can control the refresh rate manually by modifying <code>layout.frame_rate</code> at <code>about:config</code> (and restart Firefox). The default value is <code>-1</code> which means “Use vsync if available or 60hz otherwise”. Any other integer value > 0 will force that specific refresh rate.</p>
<p>Naturally, if Firefox can’t animate specific content quickly enough to keep up with the designated rate, then the actual rate will be lower.</p>
<h3 id=\"aboutnewtab\">about:newtab</h3>
<p><code>about:newtab</code> is the default page when opening a new empty tab - with the thumbnails of recently visited pages. It was <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=752839#c11\">affecting tab animations badly</a>, to the point of displaying as little as a 3 frames slideshow on low-end systems while animating the tabstrip after pressing the <code>+</code> button to add a tab.</p>
<p><em>Tim Taubert</em> from the Firefox team has done some extensive work <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=843853\">recently</a> on several bugs which fall into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable newtab <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=791670\">preload by default</a>. Newtab preload means that Firefox prepares the newtab page in the background, such that when opening a new tab it’s already rendered and therefore could be quickly displayed with very little processing. It has been working for a while but disabled by default due to accessibility issues. <em>Tim</em> removed this blocker, as well as simplified the preload mechanism and made sure that background preload <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875509\">doesn’t happen during animation</a>. This landed about a week ago and newtab preload is now enabled by default on nightlies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent unnecessary reflows of the newtab page. Reflow is the process of re-calculating the layout of the page, e.g. after window resize, and it’s relatively CPU intensive. Tim discovered that newtab causes <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=876374\">unnecessary reflows</a> on several cases, some of them <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875257\">related to preload</a>. He fixed them and also added an automatic test to detect if new reflows are accidentally introduced over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of all this work is that animating a new tab with the newtab page is now almost as smooth as opening a blank tab, with few further potential improvements to be worked on soon. Well done!</p>
<h3 id=\"talos\">Talos</h3>
<p><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=590422\">Bug 590422</a> (remove timers averaging filter) landed more than two months ago and should greatly improve timers accuracy, but it caused few regressions which are still being worked on. Talos <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=845943\">tscroll</a> was already modified as a result - which landed about 2 weeks ago, and recently <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=854746\">tsvg regressions</a> from this bug were examined as well.</p>
<p>As it turned out, tsvg was rendering SVG animations at 100-200ms intervals, and measuring/reporting the overall runtime as representative of SVG performance. At 4 of the 7 animation tests within the tsvg suite, more than 95% of the time was spent inside <code>setTimeout</code> with the browser completely idle. This resulted in tests which in practice represent the accuracy of timers more than anything else.</p>
<p>To make sure the overall runtime represents actual SVG performance, we should iterate the animation frames as fast as possible. We could do this with <code>setTimeout(loop, 0)</code>, but since Firefox renders to screen at 60hz, and it’s usually smart enough to delay reflow calculations until it’s absolutely necessary, we could end up fully processing only one in few frames when the SVG iterations are quicker than 60Hz, and at tsvg they’re much quicker than that.</p>
<p>To make sure each frame is fully processed on each iteration, we should therefore use <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> (fondly nicked <code>rAF</code>) - which makes sure that once we’re back at the callback, whatever layout changes which we introduced were already fully processed and flushed by Firefox. However, <code>rAF</code> iterates at 60hz by default (or vsync rate), which is usually not fast enough to stress our SVG tests. The solution is to set <code>layout.frame_rate</code> to a high enough value (during these tests) which causes Firefox to iterate and fully-process each frame as fast as possible. <em>Joel Maher</em> helps a lot with testing and deploying the new tsvg tests, and we hope to land it soon.</p>
<p>Making tsvg iterate ASAP also brought us back to tscroll. The recent change of tscroll was to use <code>rAF</code> instead of <code>setTimeout</code> for scroll iterations. However, while it represents scroll smoothness under normal conditions, it doesn’t detect small regressions - since Firefox isn’t actually being stressed and the scroll doesn’t limit our iteration frequency. But stressing the browser with ASAP iteration will lose the real-world simulation of normal refresh rates. So we don’t have a single approach to satisfy both of these needs.</p>
<p>We’re still <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=771326\">considering this</a>, but it seems talos will eventually run tscroll twice: once @60hz to make sure we can keep up at real-world scenarios, and once with ASAP iterations to detect performance regressions at much higher resolutions.</p>
<h3 id=\"paint-starvation\">Paint starvation</h3>
<p>While working on tsvg with ASAP iterations, we noticed that Firefox sometimes appears frozen for the entire animation (typically less than 1 second) - it only shows the last animation frame. While this happened when <code>rAF</code> was set to iterate ASAP, we discovered that there are scenarios under perfectly normal conditions which would exhibit exactly the same symptom.</p>
<p>This is now <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=880036\">bug 880036</a>. It shows is that if, for some reason, Firefox can’t iterate frames as fast as it wants to (60hz by default), then it may spend too much time on these iteration and prevent other event types from being handled on time. The most noticeable one is the paint event, since it makes Firefox appear frozen, but possibly other events are starved as well.</p>

The panel started out with professors Mike Godrey from Waterloo and Gunther Ruhe from the university of Calgary, as well as practitioners Jason Newblanc from Salesforce and Curt Patrick from Netflix.  Discussions included what topics needed more research (dependency analysis), to  a discussion of the skills do you look for when hiring a good release engineer (communication skills above all).  Given that one of the main goals of the workshop was to bring together researchers and release engineers it was very gratifying to hear from the researchers on the panel how happy they were that they had the opportunity to learn from the presentations earlier in the day.  After a while the panel shifted to include new members with new topics, and then we wrapped up to head to post-workshop dinners where the discussions continued.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rJzt3Ot0nII/UbW8xQLAEuI/AAAAAAAAD00/Y-4hxXTVaD4/s1600/IMG_1581.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"286\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rJzt3Ot0nII/UbW8xQLAEuI/AAAAAAAAD00/Y-4hxXTVaD4/s320/IMG_1581.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><br />Several attendees mentioned to me that they were happy to attend the workshop because it validated the release engineering work that they do is important.   I'm very  fortunate to work at Mozilla on a large release engineering team where  there are many people who love to talk about build optimization and  automation.  But many release engineers work in organizations where they  are the only ones who are interested in this subject.   To bring  all these people together was a great experience!<br /><br />We would like to thank everyone who attended the workshop.  Thank you to our session chairs who timed the talks and ensure that we stayed on schedule.   Thank you to Juliana Saraiva, our student volunteer, who helped with setup and throughout the day with audio and visual issues.  <br />A special thanks to all of our speakers.  Having been a speaker in the past, I understand all the work that goes into preparing talks on top of your regular day jobs and truly appreciate the effort that made this workshop successful.  At the end of the day, there was a resounding show of hands from attendees that they would like to attend another workshop.  In fact, several companies volunteered to  their space to host events which is very generous.   Please follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/relengcon\">@relengcon</a> on twitter for more information on upcoming events.  Many of the papers and presentations are available on the <a href=\"http://releng.polymtl.ca/program.html\">web site</a>.  If your slides are missing from the web site, please email them to <a href=\"http://mcis.polymtl.ca/~bram/\">Bram</a>.<br /><br />Also thank you to my colleagues at Mozilla for arranging our releng work week to be same week so many of us could attend, despite it being a Canadian holiday weekend.  You're all amazing :-)" nil nil "9e05940876ad92f204b84679e731e420") (22 (20928 8795 678066) "http://christianheilmann.com/2013/06/10/irregular-shape-rollovers-with-canvas-and-png/" "Christian Heilmann: Irregular shape rollovers with Canvas and PNG" "Chris Heilmann" "Mon, 10 Jun 2013 15:02:54 +0000" "<p>Creating rollovers is easy. Much easier than it was in the past with the infamous MM_mouseover at least. It gets tricky though when you want to have the rollover only happen on a certain shape and not only in a rectangular area.</p>
<p>There are many solutions to this, like <span class=\"caps\">SVG</span> masking or adding lots of rectangular overlays that make up the desired shape, but I wanted to have a simple solution. You can see the solution working here in this <span class=\"caps\">GIF</span>:</p>
<p><img alt=\"rollover triggered on irregular shapes\" src=\"http://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rollover.gif\" /></p>
<p>What I am doing here is adding PNGs (courtesy <a href=\"http://game-icons.net/\">Game Icons</a>) with transparency to the <span class=\"caps\">HTML</span> and give them a class of rollover:</p>
<p>
</p><div class=\"wp_syntax\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre class=\"xml\" style=\"font-family: monospace;\"><span style=\"color: #009900;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\"><img</span> </span>

<p></p>
<p>The transparent part of the <span class=\"caps\">PNG</span> will be what should not trigger the rollover, and all other pixels should.</p>
<p>The JavaScript is pretty simple and based on the principles <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/06/building-a-simple-paint-game-with-html5-canvas-and-vanilla-javascript/\">used in the letterpaint game I just explained</a> on Mozilla Hacks.</p>
<p></p><ul><li>Loop over all images with the class “rollover”</li><li>Add a mouseover, mouseout and mousemove event to each</li><li>On mouseover, take the image and copy it to an invisible Canvas element</li><li>On mousemove, find out the x and y position of the mouse cursor and read the colour of the pixel at this position from the canvas</li><li>If the pixel has an opacity of 0, it is transparent, which means remove the “over” class from the image.</li><li>If the pixel is not opaque, add the class “over” to the image.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>You can <a href=\"http://codepo8.github.io/irregular-shape-rollover/\">try this out here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/codepo8/irregular-shape-rollover/\">source code is on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This seems to be a very simple way to have irregular shaped rollovers. You could enhance the hover() function to also react differently depending of which part of the shape you are on. You can also add touch handlers easily. The only caveat is that the images and the JavaScript need to be on the same domain or the canvas is not allowed to access the pixels of the image.</p>

<p>We’ve handled a large spike in interest from people wanting to participate in the project after the <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/contribute\">Get Involved</a> page was featured in promotions about Mozilla’s 15th anniversary.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.arewegrowingyet.com\"><img alt=\"inquiry_spike4\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3298\" height=\"161\" src=\"http://davidwboswell.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/inquiry_spike4.png?w=450&h=161\" width=\"450\" /></a></p>
<p>To handle this increase in interest, we’re encouraging teams to try new things and are seeing encouraging results—for instance, Mozilla Hispano has been <a href=\"http://www.nukeador.com/14/04/2013/community-workflow-reboot-to-task-centric-approach/\">rethinking how they connect with new volunteers</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve also been looking at tools to help deal with larger numbers of potential contributors.  A <a href=\"https://etherpad.mozilla.org/cbt-working-group-systems-data\">Systems and Data Working Group</a> has been formed to identify community building functionality priorities and evaluate systems to meet those needs.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://vreplay.mozilla.com/replay/showRecordingExternal.html?key=z9JSaiFxjZ4Ig6w\"><img alt=\"jobvite_audit_recording\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3299\" height=\"252\" src=\"http://davidwboswell.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/jobvite_audit_recording.png?w=450&h=252\" width=\"450\" /></a></p>
<p>Once people start participating, we are looking into the best ways to recognize them.  Dia from the People team has worked with a university to let a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Recognition#School_Credit\">student get credit for their contributions</a> and she’s turned this into a template other teams are excited about using.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Recognition#School_Credit\"><img alt=\"student_letter_screenshot\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3300\" height=\"171\" src=\"http://davidwboswell.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/student_letter_screenshot.png?w=450&h=171\" width=\"450\" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve also really enjoyed helping with a project to <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2013/04/15/help-us-build-a-history-of-mozilla-told-by-mozillians/\">collect stories of Mozilla’s history</a>.  Once we have a compelling history, I think there’s a lot of potential to recognize contributors by showing how their contributions directly helped Mozilla reach new achievements.</p>

<p>I hope to share more often about other community building efforts going on, but my recent <a href=\"https://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/lots-going-on-with-community-building/\">blogging</a> <a href=\"https://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/lots-going-on-with-community-building-part-2/\">history</a> isn’t very encouraging.

<p>So an hour and a half later I had created <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/scriptlet/\">Scriptlet for Firefox</a>.</p>
<h3>Scriptlets</h3>
<p>A Scriptlet is a new add-on type that is the combination of a button and a bookmarklet, and it can re-use any existing bookmarklet.</p>
<p>Typically I find that I lose my bookmarklets because they get lost in my mountain of bookmarks, so I never use them, even tho there are some useful ones out there, and they are extremely easy to make.</p>
<p>Scriptlets are much easier, for starters they are completely separated from bookmarks, but they also include toolbar buttons which can be moved to any part of the user interface that I want. This means that Scriptlets can be moved to the add-on bar, the navigation bar, toolbars, and lots of other places!</p>
<h4>How To Install Scriptlets</h4>
<p>In order to install a Scriptlet, right-click on a bookmarklet, and click the ‘Make Scriptlet’ button. Once this is done you find the Script in the <a>add-on manager</a></p>
<img src=\"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/102/102740.png?modified=1370896696\" />
<h4>Scriptlets Provide Toolbar Buttons</h4>
<p>Once you make a Scriptlet a toolbar button will be automatically added to your navigation bar (aka navbar). See the top right of your browser.</p>
<img src=\"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/102/102742.png?modified=1370896696\" />
<h4>Scriptlets Are Add-ons</h4>
<p>Because Scriptlets are treated as first class add-ons they can be managed in Firefox’s Add-on Manager. This will be where you enable/disable, or uninstall a Scriptlet.</p>
<img src=\"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/102/102746.png?modified=1370896696\" />
<h4>New Features For Scriptlets</h4>
<p>One idea I’m thinking about is making the button a togglable button, this way Scriptlets will be automatically added to pages that you visit after the page loads. This will come after the SDK team launches the new UX modules near the end of Q2 whcih is coming soon.</p>

My <a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2013/06/08/at-adacamp-this-weekend-reception-plotting-for-the-imposter-syndrome-workshop/\">first post in this series</a> was about the opening reception.</p>
<h3>Allies Workshop</h3>
<p>I started the day with the 2 hour <a href=\"http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Allies_workshop\">Allies workshop</a>. Valerie Aurora led this session, with the intention to train a number of new people on how to give the workshop. I took a ton of notes, so here goes, without much editing:</p>
<p>The presentation starts with 15 minutes of introductory slides, which are Creative Commons licensed. We answer the question “why is men fighting sexism important?” There’s a visualization at the start of the number of women involved in FOSS (not many – 2%) and Wikipedia (slightly more, but still not many). We got sidetracked on a slide that had a bit of jargon on it – introducing the idea that we don’t have a gender binary, but for the purposes of the discussion today, “man” will mean “cis white male”, as that’s typically who will be participating in the allies workshop.</p>
<p>I failed to take notes on this (probably because I was intensely paying attention!).. There was a part about the <em>purpose</em> of speaking up. When you decide to speak up about sexism, you’re often not doing so to educate someone who has made a mistake, or is being a jerk. You’re helping a group set a boundary and showing everyone listening in what is ok and not ok. Super important point for me!</p>
<p>There’s a reminder to not be scared of the discussions about to happen. They will be uncomfortable possibly awkward, and that’s ok. When men speak out about sexism they do not get the same responses that women do. They are often publicly supported and privately criticized — the opposite of what happens to many women. The workshops will be a 7-minute discussions, followed by summaries and reflections to the group. These discussions are the times to ask questions, even seemingly foolish questions. Val asks that everyone respond authentically (my word, not hers) when questions are asked. This is a safe place for Allies to find the answers to difficult problems.</p>
<p>Then we went into some example scenarios. We did three scenarios that were prebaked and then one that a participant brought up. I’ll save my notes on these discussions for another time. I really enjoyed the time I spent on this, and learned quite a bit from my group.</p>
<h3>The Likeability Paradox</h3>
<p>In the book Lean In, there’s a section about the difficulty of being liked vs being respected when you are a woman leader. This discussion was by far the best large-group of the day for me, and extremely well-moderated. I wrote down lots of phrases: bossy, “risk theater”, damning with faint praise, competition between women == disdain, acceptable level of emotional discourse, the difference between “earning respect” and “earning like”, likeabliity == emotional catering, gendered insecurity about a woman’s place, the amount of time it takes to earn respect vs first impression likeability, orgs maximize stability by ignoring these kinds of problems.</p>
<p>There was the start of a great discussion about dog whistle adjectives, adverbs and verbs that subtly and not-so-subtly remind women of their role and place. Are there words we can choose to describe “aggressive” behavior, for example, that are less gendered and more fair to both men and women? Example was asking an employee to “be more aggressive”, when what the manager really meant was they wanted more “decisiveness”. Another person said they started using “inspire” instead of “convince” in their activist work.</p>
<p>There was a short discussion asking “what is respectibility” and how do we unpack that term. This brought up some experiences people have had with being questioned consistently about their qualifications — “the veracity of contribution is questioned” and “what has ‘this woman’ ever done for this community?” Another comment was that by speaking less as a manager, and “planting seeds that employees then run with and come to the same conclusion” a woman had found it much easier to get her employees to do what she wanted. There was quite a bit of discussion about how problematic recommending “speak less” is, even if it is an effective tactic. Upon reflection, I think what was problematic was the framing, rather than the management tactic. Men who are managers clearly use this tactic as well, and it is effective.</p>
<p>Later, Sumana tweeted a link to this <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=281B5C89-EC5A-42B5-939F-B279164C567A\">piece in Politico about Jill Abramson</a>.</p>
<h3>Depression and activism</h3>
<p>I mostly came to this session for tips from those in attendance. Here’s what I wrote down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask for a big chunk of time off to recharge </li>
<li>Structure time for fun </li>
<li>Only work when you really want to — give yourself permission to relax when you feel like crap! </li>
<li>Consider flipping your “alarm” system to management – start talking about how busy you are when you’re at 70% capacity, rather than 150%! </li>
<li>Be selfish with your time and energy</li>
</ul>
<p>Internal strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try cognitive behavioral therapy (there are great books: Mind over mood, Panic attack)</li>
<li>Flip negative self talk, going even so far as to rewrite personal stories in the best possible light</li>
</ul>

<p>I stopped by Heroku before heading to the reception, to meet up with @<a href=\"http://twitter.com/cathynalee\">cathynalee</a> and see my buddies at Heroku Postgres. After a round of a hilarious card game where you fight rounds to the death (with dice of course) with strange heros (mine was a Barbarian) and acquire coins to win, I headed off to the Google SF offices for our reception.</p>
<p>I’d never been to the space before. The view was pretty great.</p>

<p>Many, many old friends were there. Having the opportunity to sit and mingle and be silly for a couple hours was great for calming me down, and wonderfully restorative to be able to just relax with friends I work on so many difficult problems with, week after week. I also saw several friends from Portland, who I don’t see often enough at home. I ran into Sarah Sharp, who <a href=\"http://sarah.thesharps.us/2013/05/23/%EF%BB%BF%EF%BB%BFopw-update/\">gave me the stats on her work</a> with the Gnome Outreach Program for Women and the Linux Kernel. In short: In 13 days, 374 patches were submitted, and 137 patches were accepted. Six women were accepted into this round of OPW. Fantastic work on the part of the Linux Kernel contributors and all the women who applied.</p>
<p>I also got to mingle with hackerspace founders from Seattle and San Francisco. I’m just a supporter of hackerspaces, rather than a founder, so I felt a little bit like a fangirl joining their conversations. I also met the creator of <a href=\"http://users.humboldt.edu/mstephens/hate/hate_map.html\">Hate Map</a>, a sentiment analysis heat mapping tool.</p>
<p>And, I met a fellow coworker from Mozilla for the first time and we chatted about PyLadies, PyStar and grassroots education efforts for adult, beginner programmers. And then another woman joined us and we veered off and talked about Texas, how insane the advisory system is in high schools that steer women away from tech and science classes “to keep balance” in the girls lives (!!??!?!) and learning to drive as an adult.</p>
<p>As the party wound down, I met with some organizers of an imposter syndrome workshop. My advice to women who feel like they’re frauds: pick some badass skill to acquire and spend a couple days mastering the basics. For me, my eyes were opened to the power of badassness and the confidence that it inspires when we taught PyLadies how to use git. Several of the women who have taken these classes have come back to me with stories of impressing their coworkers, getting jobs and overall just feeling like they belonged in tech circles and discussions because they could confidently talk about git workflows.</p>
<p>Overall, great conversations and I’m looking forward to more amazing ones over the next two days.</p>" nil nil "23a0e05ddfa59c142803cff2e8f0ae2d") (13 (20928 8795 669786) "http://mykzilla.blogspot.com/2013/06/64-bit-linux-adb-for-simulator.html" "Myk Melez: 64-bit Linux ADB for Simulator" "Myk Melez" "Fri, 07 Jun 2013 23:04:04 +0000" "Thanks to the efforts of new Mozilla intern <a href=\"https://github.com/bkase\">Brandon Kase</a>, the <a href=\"https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/r2d2b2g/r2d2b2g-linux.xpi\">latest        preview build of Firefox OS Simulator for Linux</a> includes a     64-bit version of ADB, so you can push an app to an FxOS device from     64-bit Linux installations without any extra packages!<br />     <br />     Building it was tricky, because the Android SDK build scripts don't     support that target. Brandon first tried simply specifying the     target, which worked on an older version of ADB (1.0.24).

And its <a href=\"http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/raring/android-tools\">source       package</a>'s build system is much simpler than the SDK's. We just     needed a binary that works on distributions with older versions of     glibc than Raring's 2.17.

<p>I’ve been a bit quieter on this blog recently. There’s two reasons for that. The first is that I started a new, additional blog at <a href=\"http://literaci.es/\">http://literaci.es</a>.</p>
<p>But there’s another reason: we’re reasonably close to a beta release for Mozilla’s new, open learning standard for Web Literacy. </p>

The Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit, community-focused organisation: we <em>need</em> contributions from poeple like those who have volunteered their time and effort so far!</p>
<p><strong>We’re aiming to launching the beta on July 26th.</strong> There’s a number of things that need to happen before then that are internal – things like graphic design, press releases and the like. But <em>you</em> can help, too! Here’s how.</p>

<p>It was a great honor for me to be invited to give the opening keynote. This was a rare opportunity to outline some of the industry-changing RelEng-at-scale work being done at Mozilla. It also allowed me to describe some very important non-technical tactics that we used to turnaround Mozilla’s situation from “company-<strong>threatening</strong>-and-human-<strong>burnout</strong>” to “company-<strong>enabling</strong>-and-human-<strong>sustainable</strong>“. All stuff that is applicable to other software companies. Presenting the first session at the first RelEng conference helped set the tone for the event, so being down-to-earth and practical felt important. </p>
<p>My presentation focused on how effective RelEng helped Mozilla compete against larger, better funded, companies. This is what I mean by “Release Engineering as a Force Multiplier”. To give some perspective of scale, I showed:</p>
<ul>
<li>company logos scaled by <strong>headcount</strong> for each of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla. I noted that using revenue/profits instead of headcount would be just as disproportionately out of scale.<br />

<p>Anyone who has ever talked with me about RelEng knows I feel very strongly that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release Engineering is important to the success of every software project. Writing a popular v1.0 product is just the first step. If you want to retain your initial users by shipping v1.0.1 fixes, or grow your user base by shipping new v2.0 features to your existing users, you need a reproducible pipeline for accurately delivering software. Smaller projects may not have someone with formal RelEng title, but there’s always someone doing RelEng work. Otherwise, your product, and your organization, will not survive.
</li><li>Building an effective RelEng pipeline requires a different mindset to writing a great software product. Both are non-trivial, and understanding this difference in mindset enables you to hire wisely.
</li><li>The importance of Release Engineering for the sustainability of a software company is only beginning to be recognized. Release Engineering is not taught as a discipline in any CompSci course that I know of. This has the unfortunate side effect that most Release Engineers only learn on-the-job, usually as a side-effect of helping out during an organizational emergency. This limits the effectiveness of Release Engineering to what can be learned on the job, and because information isn’t widely shared, its hard to learn from other people’s mistakes or successes. By contrast, when I was studying CompSci for my undergrad and postgrad degrees, there were all sorts of course modules, books and published papers detailing which sorting algorithm was best suited for which types of data, which graphics algorithms were best suited for which types of images, etc… but nothing about Release Engineering. Nothing about how to build a pipeline to deliver that software to users… even though every software company lives-or-dies by the efficiency of their delivery-pipeline.
</li></ul>
<p>This conference was a great start to helping raise the understanding of the industry on these three points, and many more. </p>
<p>Big hat-tip to the organizers (Bram, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christianbird\">Christian</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniqueThor\">Foutse</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kmoir\">Kim</a>) – they did an awesome job putting together a unique and special event. Other industry speakers included Google, LinkedIn, MicrosoftResearch, Netflix, PuppetLabs as well as a wide range of academic speakers – see <a href=\"http://releng.polymtl.ca/program.html\">full program details here</a> and <a href=\"http://relengofthenerds.blogspot.ca/2013/05/releng-2013-keynotes-john-oduinn.html\">here</a>. In the past, I’ve attended plenty of industry conferences which have a sales-touch to them (“our technology is great, you should buy our stuff” or “our technology is great, you should come work here”), or academic conferences which have academic-accuracy-but-can-lack-urgent-practicality. By contrast, this conference was very different. All the speakers spoke candidly, humbly and objectively about the technology and tactical successes that worked for them at their companies, and equally candidly about their failures as “teaching moments” for everyone to learn from. The level of raw honestly by all these speakers, from all these different companies and academia was super-honest and very collaborative.  Additionally, the sheer volume, and the quality, of attendees blew everyone away… the discussions during breaks were just electric. Very very refreshing. I dont know if this magic was because of the carefully chosen mix of industry-vs-academia speakers, or if this was because the organizers were also a mix of industry and academia, but regardless – the end result was simply fantastic.</p>
<p>There’s already plans underway to have this RelEngConference again next year… if you build software delivery pipelines for your company, or if you work in a software company that has software delivery needs, I recommend you follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/relengcon\">@relengcon</a> and plan on attending next year.

<p>So, it seems to me only fair, to note that <strong>in this case</strong> Google repented and <a href=\"http://googledevelopers.blogspot.cz/2013/06/making-googles-caldav-and-carddav-apis.html\">turned to The Light</a>.</p>

It works really well, and comparing to the previous system it is both smaller and more convenient to use (not mentioning that <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2011/06/rsa-finally-comes-clean-securid-is-compromised/\">the previous system has been compromised</a>).</p>
<p>The only problem I had with it is, that in order to be ultra-secure it doesn't allow much configuration (my version of Yubikey doesn't have <code>use-numeric-keypad</code> option) so with my default Czech keyboard, it didn't work, and I had to switch all the time between Czech and US keyboard manually.</p>
<p>The first option seemed to be to use custom configuration snippet as described in the Fedora Wiki and create a file in <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/</code> directory with content like:</p>
<pre>Section \"InputClass\"
Identifier \"keyboard defaults\"
MatchProduct \"Yubic Yubico Yubikey II\"
Option \"XkbModel\" \"pc104\"
Option \"XkbLayout\" \"us\"
Option \"XKbOptions\" \"\"
EndSection</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this solution doesn’t work with Gnome, which controls input devices dynamically and overrides Xorg defaults.</p>
<p>Finally, I have found the solution with very kind help of Peter Hutterer  and his blogpost on <a href=\"http://who-t.blogspot.com.au/2011/03/custom-input-device-configuration-in.html\">Custom input device configuration in GNOME</a>. When the example script from <code>gnome-settings-daemon</code> is modified to include the configuration, it could also set Yubikey (and only Yubikey) input device to us keyboard layout. The key part is:</p>
<pre>case \"$1\" in
Yubico*)
echo \"Setting Yubikey layout\"
setxkbmap -device $2 -layout us

automated system that executes Python test scripts on real
user hardware, that is, actual phones. It’s been an active project for about
a year now, and we’ve learned a lot about the difficulties
of performing automated performance measurements on hardware that was never
intended for automation. I’m documenting this story for posterity, since it
has been an interesting, if often frustrating, experience. If you want to
follow along, the source is <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/autophone/\">on github</a>.</p>
<p>I’m going to divide this into a few posts to hopefully avoid tl;driness and to
ensure I actually finish at least some of this.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>For correctness testing, Mozilla’s Fennec automation is largely done with
development boards, specifically Tegras and Pandas. These boards have
wired power and ethernet, perfect for rack mounting, and all of a given
type generally behave the same.</p>
<p>These boards are not, of course, consumer devices, and,
despite having similar chipsets as real phones, they have different
performance characteristics. To really see how Fennec performs in the real
world, we need to measure Fennec on devices that people are buying and using every day. Thus
was born the Autophone project.</p>
<h3>Devices</h3>
<p>At the moment, the existing Autophone production system runs tests on kind-of-to-very “old” phones. This isn’t a limitation of Autophone; rather, it’s a
sampling of phones that were still very common last year, when the project
got truly underway. We will add newer phones as time progresses, especially
now that the system is very stable. The current system has at least one of
the following phones:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTC Google Nexus One</li>
<li>LG Revolution</li>
<li>Motorola Droid Pro</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy SII</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy SIII</li>
<li>Samsung Google Nexus S</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a few more phones waiting to be deployed in a second cluster.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>A brief discussion of Autophone’s design may help in  understanding the
problems in automation and performance measurements by providing some context.</p>
<p>Autophone consists of a main Python process with one worker process per phone.
We used processes instead of threads to isolate certain failures from other
workers. The main process has separate threads for its TCP command
server and for a <a href=\"http://pulse.mozilla.org\">pulse</a> listener.</p>
<p>The worker processes are each tied to a single device and are responsible
for controlling that device. The devices all have the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/SUTAgent\">SUTAgent</a> and Watcher
installed, to which the processes talk via <a href=\"https://mozbase.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozdevice.html\">mozdevice</a>. A worker is spawned
when the main process receives a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/SUTAgent#Registration_Server\">SUT registration</a> message on its command
port from an unknown device. Device info is cached in a JSON file, and
workers are also launched upon startup for any known device.</p>
<p>The workers each listen to their own queue, which receives commands from the
main process. Commands come from users, via the command server, or are
triggered by a build notification from pulse. The workers also check for
jobs every 10 seconds (see below).</p>
<p>Autophone also includes a simple build cache server. This server handles
requests for builds from the workers, fetching them via ftp as necessary,
ensuring that only one copy of a particular build is downloaded at the same
time, and that recently used builds are kept around, subject to space
restrictions. (This part is actually very common to our automation frameworks,
so it really should be extracted and put into its own module. Even better would
be to extend <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/mozdownload/\">mozdownload</a> to support Fennec and have the build cache server
use that to fetch builds. But I digress.)</p>
<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>When a build notification is received from pulse, or when a user issues
a “triggerjobs” command, for each device an entry containing the build URL and device name is inserted into a sqlite database. A generic “job”
command is then issued to each worker. As mentioned above, the workers
poll this database every 10 seconds. They also poll the database immediately after
executing a command, so the “job” command serves merely to trigger a poll of the database. This mechanism allows for worker processes
to be restarted, since even if a “job” command is missed, the job itself
will be picked up from the database. Along a similar vein, if the whole
system is shut down, the current test will be restarted, and any queued
tests will remain.</p>
<p>When a job successfully completes, the associated entry for that device and
build is deleted from the jobs database. The number of attempts for each job is also recorded, and a job is abandoned after too many attempts, in case there are
unrecoverable problems with a particular build or build/device combination.</p>
<p>Tests themselves are Python classes specified in a <a href=\"https://mozbase.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manifestdestiny.html#manifestdestiny-create-and-manage-test-manifests\">ManifestDestiny</a> manifest
file. They are (for better or for worse) executed in the worker process,
i.e., not as a (further) separate process. Test classes are derived from a base
class, PhoneTest, and are pretty much free form, requiring only a runjob()
method that takes a dict of build metadata and the worker subprocess object,
which can be used to manipulate the device as necessary, in particular to
attempt to recover a frozen/disappeared device (though this part should probably be
split into its own object, since a test shouldn’t be messing with the worker process
object). The PhoneTest base class also provides some
convenience functions to push profiles, start fennec, and report status
messages to the main process.</p>
<p>At the moment, we have a single active test, S1S2, which measures Fennec
startup performance. We also have support
for a few unit tests (crashtests, reftests, JS reftests, mochitests, and
robocop), though these are currently disabled pending some stability fixes.</p>
<p>Next post I’ll discuss the goal of S1S2, its challenges, and our solutions.</p>" nil nil "f898abd79baf034a4cffe836b08e4086") (5 (20928 8795 651083) "http://sriramramani.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/ellip-sis/" "Sriram Ramasubramanian: =?utf-8?Q?Ellip=E2=80=A6sis?=" "Sriram Ramani" "Fri, 07 Jun 2013 00:07:29 +0000" "<p>In the dub-dub-dub browser world, there’s a lot of need for the dot-dot-dot. The pages titles are exponentially long, to make sure Google indexes them, and they don’t fit properly on a small screen. For e.g., CNN shows a very long title that cannot be shown comfortably in a <code>ListView</code>‘s row. Firefox used to show ellipsis and truncate the text in such cases. However, there are a couple of problems: An ellipsis in the middle cuts the text off in such a way that the context is lost; an end ellipsis is not good from a design point of view. To mitigate this problem, we wanted a <code>TextView</code> that fades in the end. (Design philosophy: Show a small path, and leave the imagination to the viewer).</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_304\" style=\"width: 235px;\"><a href=\"http://sriramramani.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/ellip-sis/faded-text-view/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-304\"><img alt=\"A TextView that fades if there is more text to show.\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-304\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://sriramramani.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/faded-text-view.png?w=225&h=400\" width=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A TextView that fades if there is more text to show.</p></div>
<p>To show a faded <code>TextView</code>, we need to know when, how and how much to fade. The amount of fading needed can be exposed as an attribute, say <code>fadeWidth</code> for the custom view. When to fade part becomes easier if we can constrain the <code>TextView</code> to a single line and see if the text runs longer than available width. The XML for such a view would look like:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">    <com.sriramramani.widget.FadedTextView android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"
android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"
android:singleLine=\"true\"
android:ellipsize=\"none\"
sirius:fadeWidth=\"30dp\"/>
</pre>
<p>Every <code>TextView</code> is backed by a <code><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/Layout.html\">Layout</a></code>, that holds the information on how to draw the text on the screen. This includes the number of lines, text in each line, the line ascent, baseline, etc. Unfortunately, the <code>getWidth()</code> on the layout returns a very huge number. Fortunately, we know that the <code>TextView</code> will have only one line. Using <code><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/Layout.html#getLineWidth%28int%29\">getLineWidth(0)</a></code>, we can find the width of the first line — the entire text.</p>
<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\">    // ... somewhere in the custom text view.
Layout layout = getLayout();
if (layout.getLineWidth(0) > getMeasuredWidth()) {
// add fading.
} else {
// don't add fading.
}
</pre>
<p>That was simple! How do we add a fading effect to the end? The <code><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/LinearGradient.html\">LinearGradient</a></code> can take a range of colors and stops, and can be added as a <code>Shader</code> to a <code>Paint</code>. Voila!</p>
<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\">    // ... somewhere in the custom text view.
float start = 0.0f;
float end = getMeasuredWidth();
// mFadeWidth is obtained from the attribute.
float stop = ((float) (end - mFadeWidth) / (float) end);
// Setup the linear gradient.
LinearGradient gradient = new LinearGradient(0, 0, end, 0,
new int[] { color, color, Color.TRANSPARENT },
new float[] { 0, stop, 1.0f }
Shader.TileMode.CLAMP);
</pre>
<p>Let’s build the entire custom view now.</p>
<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\">public class FadedTextView extends TextView {
// Width of the fade effect from end of the view.
private int mFadeWidth;
// Add other constructors too.
public FadedTextView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle) {
super(context, attrs, defStyle);
TypedArray a = context.obtainStyledAttributes(attrs, R.styleable.FadedTextView);
mFadeWidth = a.getDimensionPixelSize(R.styleable.FadedTextView_fadeWidth, 0);
a.recycle();
}
@Override
public void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
int width = getMeasuredWidth();
// Layout doesn't return a proper width for getWidth().
// Instead check the width of the first line, as we've restricted to just one line.
if (getLayout().getLineWidth(0) > width) {
// Always get the current text color before setting the gradient.
int color = getCurrentTextColor();
// [0..stop] will be current text color, [stop..1] will be the actual gradient
float stop = ((float) (width - mFadeWidth) / (float) width);
// Set up a linear gradient.
LinearGradient gradient = new LinearGradient(0, 0, width, 0,
new int[] { color, color, Color.TRANSPARENT },
new float[] { 0, stop, 1.0f },
Shader.TileMode.CLAMP);
getPaint().setShader(gradient);
} else {
getPaint().setShader(null);
}
// Do a default draw.
super.onDraw(canvas);
}
}
</pre>
<p>This doesn’t take care of compound drawables and their padding. But that’s pretty straightforward as there are methods to access their properties. And that’s how we kill the ellip…sis.</p>

You can find out more about why we're doing this and how in the <a href=\"http://rawkes.com/articles/vizicities-dev-diary-1\">first dev diary</a>.</p>
<p>In the first month we had created the beginnings of a powerful platform and had a lot to show for it. Let's take a look at what's been going on since then; we're confident that it's been worth the wait!</p>
<p><em>Aside: We're currently looking for funding options to secure the future development of ViziCities. Interested? Get in touch via <a href=\"mailto:hello@vizicities.com\">hello@vizicities.com</a>!</em></p>
<h3>Realising the potential</h3>
<p>When we released the first dev diary back in March we didn't expect much of a response, after all this was just a personal project created by two people for fun. If only we knew back then what we know now — it went down a storm!</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"ViziCities plinth\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-1/vizicities-plinth.jpg\" title=\"\" />ViziCities plinth</figure><p></p>
<p>What has become clear to us is that this project is much more than a personal experiment. We're beginning to realise the huge potential of ViziCities, specifically around the power of visualising large quantities of data on a 3D, living city.</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"ViziCities SSAO demo\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-1/vizicities-combined-ssao.jpg\" title=\"\" />ViziCities SSAO demo</figure><p></p>
<p>It's also clear to us that other people are extremely excited about the project and want to get involved and help us succeed. We totally didn't expect this and have been humbled by the response so far.</p>
<p>We've obviously hit on something important and we're keen to make sure it happens!</p>
<h3>Exciting discussions with third parties</h3>
<p>Since the last update we've been talking with a number of third parties who we'd like to work with to help make ViziCities better. These third parties range from important individuals, to Fortune 500 companies, to open source initiatives, all the way to large government organisations.</p>
<p>We've been blown away by the response when we show these guys our progress. It's also shown us is that there is clearly huge amount of interest for the project and its future potential as a data visualisation platform. In short, we're confident we're onto a winner.</p>
<p>I won't go into too much detail just yet, but here are a few examples of the kind of people we've been meeting with in the past few weeks:</p>
<h4>Ordnance Survey</h4>
<p>The national mapping agency for Great Britain. If you live in the UK then you've likely used an Ordnance Survey map or service.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/osmapping/5200710145/\"></a></p><figure><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/osmapping/5200710145/\"><img alt=\"Ordnance Survey HQ\" src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4153/5200710145_b1034f271e_b.jpg\" title=\"\" />Ordnance Survey HQ</a></figure><p></p>
<h4>Transport for London (TfL)</h4>
<p>The guys who run the entire public transport network in London.</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"View from the TfL offices\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/tfl.jpg\" title=\"\" />View from the TfL offices</figure><p></p>
<h4>Data.gov.uk</h4>
<p>The curators of the UK's primary open data store.</p>
<h4>And many more!</h4>
<p>We've been talking to <em>a lot</em> of people since the last update, these have been just a few of them. We're keen to talk to more people so get in touch via <a href=\"mailto:hello@vizicities.com\">hello@vizicities.com</a> and we'd love to work something out.</p>
<h3>Talking at events about our progress and experience</h3>
<p>One of the most exciting non-development things that happened recently was the opportunity to talk about ViziCities at the Front-Trends conference in Poland. It was great fun and the community was superb!</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"Pete (right) and I (left) at Front-Trends\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/front-trends.jpg\" title=\"\" />Pete (right) and I (left) at Front-Trends</figure><p></p>
<p>During the talk we covered a little about the history of the project, as well as some of the development issues we encountered, and perhaps even a little secret demo at the end. You'll have to watch the video (below) and find out for yourself…</p>
<p></p><figure></figure><p></p>
<p>We've got a bunch more talks in the pipeline and can't wait to show more people what we've been up to. The project is changing week on week and so we always have something new and exciting to talk about.</p>
<p>Please get in touch via <a href=\"mailto:hello@vizicities.com\">hello@vizicities.com</a> if you think we'd fit in with your event, it's likely we'd love to come talk.</p>
<h3>Awesome new features</h3>
<p>We've been alluding to some very exciting features for a while now, and we're finally ready to show you some of them!</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"Secret ViziCities feature\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-1/vizicities-future.jpg\" title=\"\" />Secret ViziCities feature</figure><p></p>
<h4> Leap Motion</h4>
<p>Not long after the last update we soon realised that there was huge potential for us to utilise the <a href=\"http://leapmotion.com\">Leap Motion</a> as a new way of interacting with the 3D visualisation (think Minority Report). What we didn't expect was Leap Motion reaching out to us and sending a dev kit to experiment with!</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"Pete and I demoing the Leap Motion support at Front-Trends\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/leap-motion.jpg\" title=\"\" />Pete and I demoing the Leap Motion support at Front-Trends</figure><p></p>
<p>It's early days and we haven't put too much time into integration yet, but check out this video for a cool demo of what we managed to cobble together in half an hour:</p>
<p></p><figure></figure><p></p>
<p>All in all, we're massively impressed with the Leap Motion (it's so accurate!) and reckon we can make some really intuitive interactions for people using the device.</p>
<h4>Live data</h4>
<p>Live data is something Pete and I are keen to explore in depth for ViziCities. One of the later experiments has been to visualise live tweets within the 3D city environment, which ended up looking really cool!</p>
<p><em>Aside: Twitter visualisations are <a href=\"http://tweetmap.it\">something close to Pete and I</a>, we love them.</em></p>
<p>We haven't finished this yet but we're aiming to make the tweets float out of the city similar to the way a balloon floats out of a child's hand and into the sky. Here's a little video of our current progress (the tweets are real):</p>
<p></p><figure></figure><p></p>
<p>The eagle-eyed amongst you will notice that there aren't many tweets appearing, considering London uses Twitter so much. There are 2 reasons for this; the first is that we recorded this video early on a Friday morning, the second is that we only have access to Twitter's 1% real-time stream so in reality there are many, many more tweets.</p>
<p>And now for the feature we've been the most excited about…</p>
<h4>London Underground in 3D and real-time</h4>
<p>Ever since we started the project we've wanted to visualise public transport in real-time and 3D. Why? Partly because it'll look amazing, but mostly because this is exactly the kind of thing that will help bring cities to life.</p>
<p>We decided that our first challenge was to build the London Underground network in 3D, with the aim to then place real-time trains along the 3D tracks. This was something we'd not seen before — anywhere — and definitely not something seen on the Web. Crazy? We thought so too, but it was worth a try.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we had a head-start thanks to <a href=\"http://traintimes.org.uk/map/tube/\">Matthew Somerville's live (2D) tube map</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/businessandpartners/syndication/\">the TfL APIs</a>. However, the 3D aspect introduced a whole world of complexity to the challenge (eg. how deep are the stations?), but we were prepared to take it on!</p>
<h5>We succeeded</h5>
<p>We'll save the break-down of how we implemented it for another post (we learnt a lot) but it's safe to say that we got it working and it looks beautiful. Oh, and you see those icons above the tube lines? Those are trains. Real trains. Moving in real-time. In 3D…</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"Close-up of the London Underground\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/underground-1.jpg\" title=\"\" />Close-up of the London Underground</figure><p></p>
<p>What you can see here is the result of many hours of work from Pete and I, ranging from programming time, to nearly giving up trying to understand the algorithms involved, to hours spent manually wrestling with Excel spreadsheets containing the data we needed. Let's just say that the world would be a better place if data was offered in a variety of similar, usable formats.</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"The London Underground\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/underground-2.jpg\" title=\"\" />The London Underground</figure><p></p>
<p>The result, if we do say so ourselves, is amazing. We can't actually believe that we did it! The cherry on top is that the London Underground in 3D looks just as good as we'd hoped.</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"An overview of the London Underground network\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/underground-3.jpg\" title=\"\" />An overview of the London Underground network</figure><p></p>
<p>We still have a way to go but we certainly have the beginnings of a live public transport 3D visualisation platform, at least for London. From here we hope to move onto busses and other aspects of the network in London.</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"Adding UI interactions for live trains\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/underground-4.jpg\" title=\"\" />Adding UI interactions for live trains</figure><p></p>
<p>Static screenshots are so boring, so here's a video showing off our latest and greatest feature. We hope you enjoy it as much as we have!</p>
<p></p><figure></figure><p></p>
<p>Want to talk to us about this? Get in touch via <a href=\"mailto:hello@vizicities.com\">hello@vizicities.com</a> and we'll spill as many beans as we can.</p>
<h4>And much more!</h4>
<p>While the London Underground in 3D is clearly the most exciting feature to date, we've also been working on many others. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ambient sound via the Web Audio API</li>
<li>Better AI (video below)</li>
<li>Implementing UI and interaction</li>

<p>Rest assured, there is much more left to do. We've only just touched the surface of what's possible with the platform!</p>
<h3>Help fund the future of ViziCities</h3>
<p>With that in mind, we need your help. To continue working on ViziCities and ensure it's future success we need to start working on it full time and really give it the attention it deserves. To do that we need to live, and to live we need to earn money.</p>
<p>I'll keep this brief, we're now actively looking to explore financing options to fund future development. Particularly in the early stages, we're keen to explore being sponsored by like-minded organisations who also want to see a platform like ViziCities happen and succeed.</p>
<p>Know anyone who would be interested to support the future of the project? Get in touch via <a href=\"mailto:hello@vizicities.com\">hello@vizicities.com</a> and we'll get right back!</p>
<p>We've been blown away by your response so far. We're making this happen and we'd love to have you as a part of it!</p><div class=\"feedflare\">

(China, India, Argentina, Israel!)<br /><br />RTT is the hidden driver in so much of internet performance and to whatever extent possible it needs to be quashed. Its so much more than time to first byte.<br /><br />Bandwidth, CPU, even our ability to milk more data out of radio spectrum, all improve much more rapidly than RTT can.<br /><br />Making  RTT better is really a physical problem and is, in the general case at least,  really really hard. Making things less reliant on RTT is a software  problem and is a more normal kind of hard. Or at least it seems if you're a software developer.<br /><br />RTT is not just time to  the first byte of a web request. It's DNS. Its the TCP handshake. Its the  SSL handshake. Its the time it takes to do a CORS check before an XHR. Its the time it  takes to grow the congestion window (i.e. how fast you speed up from slow start) or confirm revocation status of the SSL certificate. Its the time it takes to do an HTTP redirect. And it is the time you're stalled while you recover from a packet loss. They're all some  factor of RTT.<br /><br />HTTP/2 and SPDY take the first step of dealing with this by creating a prioritized and muxxed protocol which tends to make it more often bandwidth bound than HTTP/1 is. But even that protocol still has lots of hidden RTT scaling algorithms in it.<br /><br /><br />" nil nil "685cd5ccee9e09d9e2a73f53143ee54d") (2 (20928 8795 647197) "http://monica-at-mozilla.blogspot.com/2013/05/blushproof.html" "Monica Chew: Blushproof" "Monica Chew" "Thu, 06 Jun 2013 17:16:20 +0000" "<h4>Personal embarrassment, Firefox, and you.</h4>Have you ever been personally embarrassed because your friends or housemates found out something about your browsing history?

<p>The Platform meeting has been in limbo for some time. Since taking the helm in February, I found it difficult to answer questions like: What is the purpose of this meeting? Who is the target audience? Why do we meet each week? After discussions in the meeting and on the Mozilla <a href=\"https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-platform\">dev-platform mailing list</a>, this week I made a mostly wholesale change and rebooted the meeting.</p>
<h3>The Engineering Meeting</h3>
<p>The name “Platform Meeting” is a holdover from the meeting’s origins. This meeting has long included updates from non platform teams such as the desktop front-end, mobile front-end, and stability teams. More recently, the meeting added updates from Firefox OS and Firefox Metro. This is really an engineering wide meeting so let’s call it the “Engineering Meeting”.</p>
<h3>Meeting Purpose</h3>
<p>One of my goals with this reboot was to be able to clearly articulate what this meeting was about. My working definition of the meeting’s purpose is:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Engineering meeting is a weekly time to discuss the work of engineering teams and share information relevant to the day-to-day work of engineers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Meeting Agenda</h3>
<p>I restructured the meeting agenda around the meeting purpose. The meeting now focuses on engineering teams and the relevant information from engineering support teams. I have also asked each person responsible for an agenda item to update the wiki the day before the meeting so as to have a set agenda before the meeting starts.</p>
<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Agenda</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Actions</strong><br /> Action items from previous meetings.</li>
<li><strong>Hot Bugs<br /> </strong>Orange Factor, Stability, and other high priority bugs that are currently unowned or require help to make progress.</li>
<li><strong>The Need To Know<br /> </strong>Release related notices and schedule and upcoming system outages and upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>Key Issues<br /> </strong>Bigger topics and non team specific issues that are of interest to Engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Team Stand-ups<br /> </strong>A short (<2 min) update from each engineering team. No questions during the updates!</li>
<li><strong>Quality Programs<br /> </strong>An opportunity to hear about relevant updates from our Critsmash, Memshrink, Orange Factor, and Stability initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Roundtable<br /> </strong>All other issues and any questions that come up over the course of the meeting.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Meeting Time</h3>
<p>The meeting time remains unchanged. The Engineering Meeting is held Tuesdays, at 11am PT. Details about joining this public meeting are <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/#Meetings\">available on wikimo</a>.</p>
<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>
<p>One of the requests that came from the dev-platform discussion was for improved meeting notes. I would like to know whether the changes that have been made to the meeting agenda have resulted in an improvement to the notes. If you read the notes, I would appreciate your input. Please comment on this post, post to dev-platform, or e-mail me privately. For your reference, here’s a link to <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/2013-06-04\">this week’s notes</a>.</p>
<h3>Feedback From the First Meeting</h3>
<p>The feedback after the first meeting was very positive. Here’s a sample from IRC:</p>
<blockquote><p>“congrats on drastically improving this meeting (IMHO) I am feeling greatly optimistic about mozilla all of a sudden”<br /> – Brad Lassey (<a href=\"http://irclog.gr/#show/irc.mozilla.org/planning/27639\">ref</a>)</p>
<p>“this is the change we needed”<br /> – Doug Turner (<a href=\"http://irclog.gr/#show/irc.mozilla.org/planning/27642\">ref</a>)</p>
<p>“yeah i think i’m going to start coming to these regularly again”<br /> – Jesse Ruderman (<a href=\"http://irclog.gr/#show/irc.mozilla.org/planning/27643\">ref</a>)</p>
<p>“this is exactly what I wanted to get out of this meeting”<br /> – Daniel Veditz (<a href=\"http://irclog.gr/#show/irc.mozilla.org/planning/27645\">ref</a>)</p>
<p>“this meeting was very useful to me, learned several interesting things”<br /> – Gavin Sharp (<a href=\"http://irclog.gr/#show/irc.mozilla.org/planning/27646\">ref</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>A Work In Progress</h3>
<p>I consider the Engineering Meeting a work in progress. This meeting should continue to evolve to meet the needs of our engineering teams. Have an idea to improve the meeting? Please post to dev-platform or get in touch with me privately.</p>
