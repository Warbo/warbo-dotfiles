"Erik Vold" "Sun, 07 Jul 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "<p>I’m nearly 30 now, so it has taken me a long time to figure out out why it is I keep getting up every day, I am sad to say, but then again how many people can articulate why it is they exist, and identify what motivates them? I suspect that those figures would be depressing..</p>
<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/deezthugs\">David Dahl</a> asked me a good question at the last Mozilla Summit in 2010, well before I really started contributing to Mozilla. He asked, “What is it you want to do Erik?”, and I had no real answer, which depressed the hell out of me. At the time I had been writing quite a few UserScripts, Ubiquity commands, Jetpacks, and I loved Firefox which enabled all of this. I had also just started spending the time to figure out how Firefox extensions worked, and started contributing to my long time friend Greasemonkey which gave me great pleasure. I was out of work at the time, doing odd jobs here at there, surviving on the bare essentials, and spending all of my time in a dark room, coding my ass off.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that I was not optimistic about the future. I could feel an undefinable drive to keep working, but I had no understanding why, nor belief that any of my efforts were worth while. My old friends from high-school were getting jobs at the post office and auto-repair shops, selling drugs or collecting unemployment checks, drinking away their nights, pissing away their days, and loving it as far as I could tell. While my old friends from UBC weren’t doing much better, and I had absolutely no interest in sharing their fates. So I avoided these people, they were and are nice people, and spending time with them in the past was an educating and empowering experience that I no longer had any use for. I felt quite alone, a feeling that has stayed with me since and had been hard to shake, until I visited Mozilla HQ.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.azarask.in/\">Aza Raskin</a> had saved me with a single email, asking me if I would be a Jetpack Ambassador, and unknowingly I started a meditation on what it meant (for me) to be a Mozillian, because I knew I would like to become one, or die trying.</p>
<p>Again, my drive was undefinable to me at the time, I could not really answer well enough (to satisfy myself) why it was I wanted to be a Mozillian. I had read <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto/\">Mozilla’s manifesto</a> and I liked it, but I could not say that it moviated me, I take too much pride in being a nonconformist to subscribe to a manifesto, and frankly I thought it was too internet specific, saying things like ‘the internet should be this’ and ‘the internet should not be that’ which is all well and good, but this was not going to be a document that got me out of bed every day. It is closer than anything I had ever read to this very day though.</p>
<p>It’s funny how a revelation can at once seem so awesome and so obvious at the same time. I’ve always known why I drag myself out of bed each morning, I just couldn’t say it. I want to empower others, through thought and deeds, I want to make life more secure and productive, for myself and others. I am by no means be the best or most capable at achieving this, and I’m certainly under no such illusion, but that is what motivates me and that is why Voldzilla exists.</p>" nil nil "c3b9c8751536084c4b850579ff21a4f2") (287 (20954 29014 923758) "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BenjaminKerensaDotComMozilla/~3/9q7RaF3E6zk/mozilla-at-oscon" "Benjamin Kerensa: Mozilla at OSCON" "Benjamin Kerensa" "Sat, 06 Jul 2013 23:45:15 +0000" "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"thickbox no_icon\" href=\"http://cdn.benjaminkerensa.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mozilla_wordmark.png\" title=\"mozilla wordmark 300x121 Mozilla at OSCON\"><img alt=\"mozilla wordmark 300x121 Mozilla at OSCON\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1973 aligncenter\" height=\"121\" src=\"http://cdn.benjaminkerensa.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mozilla_wordmark-300x121.png\" title=\"Mozilla at OSCON\" width=\"300\" /></a>If you are attending O’Reilly Open Source Convention this year then be sure to attend one of the great talks being given by Mozillians this year:</p>

The audience is incredibly creative and mixed and the workshops range from the traditional web tech topics to robotics to hacking for good and up to getting kids to build their first machines.</p>
<p>This year I got invited to give the closing talk of the Barcelona instance of WebVisions and I went all out on that one. Instead of giving a detailed technical talk I took the opportunity to remind ourselves of the importance of a web for everyone and how we fail at delivering that old dream of its inventors.</p>
<p>The <a href=\"http://icant.co.uk/talks/h5/webvisions2013.html?full#makers\">slides (without notes) are available on the web</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56gRF-ypBM4\">video of the screencast is on YouTube</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is a (long but also short) summary of what I was talking about: <img alt=\"please don't hurt the web\" src=\"http://icant.co.uk/talks/h5/pictures/sotb13/please-dont-hurt-the-web-new.png\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>I started the talk with an example how things can go wrong when they should be right. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLuW-GBaJ8k\">Richard Strauss’ “Also sprach Zarathustra”</a> inspired by <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7205\">Friedrich Nietzsche’s book with the same title</a> is an iconic piece of music. It was brought to a totally new audience with its use in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RDeDVu5fFI\">2001 – A space odyssey</a>, the – in its own right – iconic movie by Stanley Kubrick. Now if you <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpJ6anurfuw\">listen to this version</a>,  however, it sounds more like terrible things being done to elephants than the original song.</p>
<p>What happened? Were the musicians just terrible? Yes, but also, no. The second version is by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_Sinfonia\">Portsmouth Sinfonia</a>, a classical ensemble put together by either people who did not know how to play, but also by people who are gifted musicians, but weren’t allowed to play the instrument they know. It was a tongue-in-cheek experiment to see if musical genius is something that is given or can get taught to anyone with the right amount of effort.</p>
<p>The horrid, cacophonous outcome of this shows one thing – the wrong instruments in the hands of the right experts will not yield good results. And this is the vibe I am getting a lot when people speak about “the mobile web”. When smartphones came about everybody got incredibly excited: web developers saw a whole new market opening and new, interesting challenges coming towards them and native developers out of a sudden were asked to build things with web technology (this includes in my book Flash developers, who out of a sudden were asked to “do <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> as this works on iPhone”). The new form factor of smartphones brought up some new challenges for developers, who, until then, were used to catering to desktop users on fast, stable connections with computers that were in a certain range of resolutions. Out of a sudden, we found ourselves with new challenges:</p>
<p></p><ul><li class=\"active\">Unknown, smaller screen size</li><li>New ways of interaction – touch, voice</li><li>Flaky, slow connections</li><li>Limited data plans</li><li>Less patient end users</li></ul><p></p>
<p>Or so we told ourselves and people got very excited and worried about all these “new” things. We threw out a lot of truisms like “users on the phone are always busy and want a few big buttons as the interface” and started to consider locking our solutions down to one phone on one platform the only solution to delivering “exciting experiences”. If you took your job as a web developer serious though, then none of this should be new to you. We never were able to tell what the end user has at her disposal to consume what we put on the web and that is the beauty of it!</p>
<p>When Tim Berners-Lee came up with the idea of the web, the concept of what hardware and in what resolution or what connectivity it is consumed in was never, ever included. It is a system to deliver content and get it consumed by other computers. Or, as stated in the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility\"><span class=\"caps\">W3C </span>Accessibility guidelines</a>:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>In other words: <strong>fiercely flexible</strong> is what the web should be. And the advent of smartphones and mobile computing consuming web content rather than just email and text messages brought this original idea more than ever back into the spotlight.</p>
<p>And instead of embracing it and finally giving in and saying “well, we have no clue what people use, so let’s use software to do what it does best – test and then adapt” we overload users on the desktop with lots and lots of widgets and an avalanche of content and we limit the mobile interfaces to the bare minimum, in many cases not even in a working fashion. The current mobile web is a failure, so much that clever marketers manage to sell to many companies the idea that asking users to “download the app” when they come to the site using a mobile device is the best choice. It reminds me of popup windows and Flash tunnels – both of which, luckily, are hardly ever used any longer.</p>
<p>Which is weird and disheartening seeing just how blessed we are these days with great tools to learn our trade. There are dozens of online course companies out there – many of them free and even then very high quality. Our browsers have amazing debugging tools and there is a large amount of collaborative editing tools out there where you can try and debug together with other people.</p>
<p>How is it we are losing ground? How is it that webstandards based interfaces are such a disappointment? Well, there are a few reasons:</p>
<p>First, we are too busy fixing things that are not a problem yet. The whole web world is abuzz trying to find solutions for the “retina problem”. We have a few very shiny, very cool devices that need high resolution images to look good. We also have an infrastructure that doesn’t support that much image data to be transferred in time. So we bash our heads together trying to solve that problem. Why? Why not ask the companies who break the web with their proprietary hardware and secret roadmaps to find a way to fix it in their hardware? Why should it be upon us as developers to reverse engineer and hack around issues that are man-made?</p>
<p>The very frustrating part about this is that we are solving a problem of a small minority of people. Granted, the richest ones and the ones that consume the most. But the web is more, and we should be thinking about tapping into the group of those that are not on the web right now, but have demands and needs that could be fulfilled by it.</p>
<p>Secondly a big problem that we have is reminiscent of the Portsmouth Sinfonia: we have a lot of developers doing design and designers doing development. Either because they are asked to, or because they are deluded enough that they think they can do everything or because our project plans are not catered for allowing specialists to do what they do best but instead to roll out the product as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Almost weekly there is some rant by developers that <span class=\"caps\">CSS</span> is too hard, not logical enough and needs replacement. Or designers answering “just use a jQuery plugin” for any problem that comes up in web development rather than finding a much simpler, more scalable and easier to understand JavaScript solution.</p>
<p>Maybe instead of trying to replace something we don’t get along with we find a person who loves doing it and partner with them? If I hire a plasterer to fix my ceiling I don’t expect him also to check out the plumbing of my house or build me a nice cupboard. Instead of ranting and calling a technology inapplicable we should leave it to other experts to do that part of the job for us and deliver the product with us.</p>
<p>All in all, this is just laziness or unwillingness to learn something new. We  keep to our small worlds and see everything as a nail as we have one hammer at our disposal – not realising that in many cases the nail turns out to be a thumb once we have a go at it. A developer giving other developers design advice on Stackoverflow telling them to “use a layout table, as <span class=\"caps\">CSS</span> isn’t ready for this” or a designer telling other designers to “just use this library” without understanding what it does under the hood is stagnation and fleeing into quick solution land where everything can be healed by applying a band-aid.</p>
<p>One big thing is people claiming that they have no talent for programming or others for interface design. One person that told this the right way is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross\">Bob Ross</a>:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Talent is a pursued interest. In other words, anything that you are willing to practice, you can do.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Practice makes perfect, and you can only get better by learning from people who know the thing you want to learn. That is why the most important thing we need to do as creators of the web now is to collaborate and learn from another.<br />
We are experts and experts use expert tools and talk to other experts. They do not just go and buy the first thing that promises a fast solution. That’s what frauds do. If we don’t want to be frauds, we should stop doing a few things:</p>
<p></p><ul><li>Looking for technical solutions on Google. This is what underpaid helpdesk people do. “Any answer will do”</li><li>“Use this, it will solve all your problems” is nonsense used in advertising</li><li>Finding out the “how” doesn’t give you anything if it doesn’t answer the “why” at the same time.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>All of these lead not to solutions and products, they lead to stop-gap solutions. And as we are normally not on the same project for a long time following these principles means we fill up the web with quick hacks and stop-gap solutions.</p>
<p>Instead we should tap into the community when we have a problem:</p>
<p></p><ul><li class=\"active\">Write a demo of your problem and post it on <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net\">JSFiddle</a>, <a href=\"http://jsbin.com/\">JSBin</a>, <a href=\"http://dabblet.com/\">Dabblet</a>, <a href=\"http://codepen.io/\">Codepen</a> or <em>whatever</em> has collaborative coding.</li><li class=\"active\">Go on Twitter/Google+/Facebook and ask people</li><li class=\"active\">Let’s use <strong>#cssissue</strong> or <strong>#jsissue</strong> as hashtags? That’s what the cool kids use!</li><li class=\"active\">Get fixes and share your learnings with the community</li></ul><p></p>
<p>In other words: we should talk more. The web became what it was by collaboration, sharing and open discussion of problems and solutions. If we make these work around code and tangible examples we can avoid a lot of nonsensical, dogmatic discussions and “meh, just use $x” answers.</p>
<p>We forgot how to share knowledge, as we are stuck in a rat-race about innovating to “keep up with native”.</p>
<p>The question is though, what is the future of the web? I don’t know, but I feel very deeply that it will not be about a certain hardware. I also know deep down that it will not be about one browser. I also know that there is no such thing as an <span class=\"caps\">SDK</span> or an <span class=\"caps\">IDE</span> for the web (something native developers keep asking for when they start building web apps). And I know for sure that it is not achievable when mainstream media and governments keep trying to tell us that the web needs to be controlled to avoid people getting content they shouldn’t get. That last ship has sailed recently with – ironically – the release of a certain powerpoint presentation.</p>
<p>Is it trying to give users the same experience native solutions do? I don’t think so – at all. I find apps to be a step back and a step into a direction of controlled consumption rather than distributed discovery and consumption. And it hurts me to talk to new developers asking me where they can get a certain hardware before they can build their first web app. No, you do not need the hardware to build an app – you need the knowledge and the tools and both are available in the form of standards and freely available information and editors. The latter will sooner or later simply be part of the browser.</p>
<p>It hurts me to see that developers start thinking they need to “pay to play”. This is a horrible step backwards to me. The web is there for anyone to become a publisher. Closed environments work very much against that idea.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that sooner or later people would try to rein the web in and make it easier to sell and digest. This is how selling always worked and it is actually based on a principle defined in 1955 by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Lebow\">Victor Lebow</a> in <a href=\"http://whatdoino-steve.blogspot.co.uk/2007/12/victor-lebows-complete-original-1955.html\">an article in the Journal of Retailing</a>:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Our enormously productive economy … demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals. That we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption … we need things consumed, burned up, replaced and discarded at an ever-accelerating rate.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>In other words, things need to break. The phone has to die, so people buy a new one. That doesn’t work with intangible things like software and with things that are distributed and copied as soon as they become available. Which is why it needs even more to make people consume more. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Stevens\">Clifford Brooks-Stevens</a> defined the priniciple to make that happen in 1954 already, that of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence\">planned obsolescence</a>:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Planned style obsolescence occurs when marketers change the styling of products so customers will purchase products more frequently. The style changes are designed to make owners of the old model feel out of date.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Do end users really need Retina displays? Or is it a wish, is it a need caused by damn good advertising and giving them a feeling of “not belonging to the hip people” when they don’t have it? As early as 1960 the concept of planned obsolescence was critiqued. My favourite quote is by Vance Packard in “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Waste-Makers-Vance-Packard/dp/1935439375\">The Waste Makers</a>“:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>“The systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently discontented individuals”.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>I am afraid that this dark prediction is coming true. Yes, Moore’s Law is in full effect and things get faster, smaller and cheaper all the time but not everybody who buys an iPhone just to go online can really afford it. And whatever new and cool we buy, we are annoyed with a few weeks later and consider it outdated.</p>
<p>How can we break this cycle? How can we bring the original ideas of the web to the mobile space, rather than the self-destructive cycle of perishable and – by design – soon obsolete products?</p>
<p>I am very happy to be part of one of the anti-movements of this: Firefox OS. FirefoxOS is a completely open operating system, built on web standards and available for download. It is not there to kill iOS or Android. It is there to bring web connectivity to the people who do not have it yet and who could never afford to be part of the race for new, faster, higher-resolutioned and shinier every half year. It has a few unique features:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>It is targeted at new, emerging markets</strong> – true, the first country FirefoxOS phones are available right now is Spain, but that was a decision by our partner Telefonica. In the long run Firefox OS is going where the other players don’t bother to go – yet. If they go later on and offer affordable hardware, we as Mozilla have reached the goal we set ourselves: opening the mobile space</li><li>It runs on very affordable hardware</li><li>There is no credit card needed – apps can be bought on the phone bill or via prepaid cards (this is a big obstacle for people)</li><li>It is web technologies through and through – the OS and Apps are <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span></li><li>You have full hardware access via <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI\">open APIs</a></li><li>We have 21 mobile partners and 6 hardware partners</li></ul><p></p>
<p>Apps for the OS can come from the marketplace – much like any other mobile platform – but you can also easily make them installable from the web with a simple <span class=\"caps\">JS API</span> call. A web page can become an app just by defining a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Manifest?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Apps%2FManifest\">manifest file</a>.</p>
<p>The really disruptive idea, however, is that Firefox OS turns the “find app, install app, use app” on its head. Instead of having to find an app by name in a marketplace, the search functionality of the OS allows you to find applications by entering a search term, like a band name, a movie name or anything else. After the system found an applicable app in the marketplace or on the web it shows you its icon. Clicking the icon sends the search term to the app and you immediately get what you came for. No need to enter the data again or go through an install process. If you like the app, you can long-tap it and install it. Your <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> mobile-optimised web sites become the ad for your app. You can see it all <a href=\"http://icant.co.uk/talks/h5/pictures/sotb13/dynamicsearch.mp4\">in the following video</a>:</p>
<p><video class=\"middle\" controls=\"\" height=\"450\"><source src=\"http://icant.co.uk/talks/h5/pictures/sotb13/dynamicsearch.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /><source src=\"http://icant.co.uk/talks/h5/pictures/sotb13/dynamicsearch.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" /></video></p>
<p>All in all, Firefox OS promises web developers a few things:</p>
<p></p><ul><li>A whole new audience</li><li><span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> without the lock-out</li><li>Your web site is your ad!</li><li>Minimal extra work, it works across platforms</li></ul><p></p>
<p>You don’t need to build apps for Firefox <span class=\"caps\">OS </span>– you build them for the web and Firefox OS gives you the most APIs to play with and full access to the hardware.</p>
<p>All in all, we need <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/\">makers of the web</a> to unite and to ensure that what we know goes to the next generation. If we do not fight this fight right now, the web as we know it will play a second role to closed systems. Those will fade away – as they always do – but, to me, it seems like a big waste to spend lots of money and effort when we already have something that works. You can innovate faster and better in a closed space – no doubt about that – but being flexible makes you succeed in the longer run and reach people you don’t even know yet and who are hungry to get something new.</p>" nil nil "ba20633c02e535c7971a4be0e851a529") (283 (20954 29014 911805) "http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/?2013/07/01/840-exempi-221" "Hub =?utf-8?Q?Figui=C3=A8re=3A?= Exempi 2.2.1" "hub" "Tue, 02 Jul 2013 00:25:30 +0000" "<p>Just a quick note to announce that I released <a href=\"http://libopenraw.freedesktop.org/wiki/Exempi/\">Exempi 2.2.1</a>.

One way is differential pricing – charge more at peak times. Another way is energy storage, so you can supply more at peak times. One method of storage is to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air_energy_storage\">store the energy using compressed air</a>. The disadvantage is that compressing the air gives off heat, and re-expanding it requires heat. Not supplying heat during re-expansion makes the storage much less efficient. </p>
<p>So which industry has large and fairly constant power costs it would like to reduce by buying some of that power at off-peak prices, equipment which can be placed anywhere, including where land prices are cheap, plus a lot of waste heat it doesn’t know what to do with?</p>
<p>Someone should come up with a gas compression power storage system for data centres.</p>
<p>Cost of power, ballpark: $0.06 per kWH peak (say 8am – 6pm), $0.03 off-peak<br />
Power consumption of server: 1KW<br />
Current cost of power per server per day: $1.02<br />
Potential saving per server per year if all power used were priced at the off-peak price: $110</p>
<p>One issue is that a 5l bottle <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air_storage#Energy_density_and_efficiency\">can store</a> 500kJ of energy (0.14 kwH), so you’d need 500l per server. That’s a lot, so you may not be able to get the full saving unless you use an underground cavern rather than surface storage tanks. But if land is cheap, you could make a dent in your power bill.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this post was half-written before I saw <a href=\"http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/13/07/03/1819254/underground-wind-mines-could-keep-datacenters-powered\">this Slashdot article</a>.</p>

This post is a attempt to gather Bugzilla tips from around the Internet whilst adding a few of my own to the list.</p>
<p>To start, if you’ve never used Bugzilla before (or even if you have), you should watch a video <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnath\">johnath</a> made called \"Bugzilla for Humans.\" It gives a really nice overview of key Bugzilla features, as well as tips for more advanced users:</p>
<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\">

</div>
<h3>Quicksearch, I'll Race Ya!</h3>
<p>The most useful tip I know of is to set up a keyword search for the quicksearch box. Open <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/\">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/</a> and right-click the quicksearch box near the top of the page. Select \"Add a keyword for this search…\" and in the keyword field type \"bug.\" You can now search bugzilla using queries like this directly from your Firefox Awesome Bar:</p>
<div class=\"syntax_highlight\"><pre class=\"bash\">bug <span class=\"nu0\">50000</span> <span class=\"co0\"># Open bug 50000.</span></pre></div>
<p>Or even:</p>
<div class=\"syntax_highlight\"><pre class=\"bash\">bug WONTFIX Inspector <span class=\"co0\"># Open bugs containing \"Inspector\" and marked as WONTFIX.</span></pre></div>
<p>Two lists of quicksearch fields are available. A simplified list can be found <a href=\"http://www.squarefree.com/bugzilla/quicksearch-help.html\">here</a> and a more complete list can be found <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=quicksearch.html\">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/beltzner\">Mike Beltzner</a> created an excellent video explaining some of the ways this feature can be used:</p>
<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\">

</div>
<h3>Watching a Component or a Developer</h3>
<p>If you find yourself interested in a certain area of the Mozilla project e.g. Firefox::Developer Tools, you can opt to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=component_watch\">watch its Bugzilla component</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=email\">watch certain users</a>, which is a really neat feature if you’re a new contributor looking to follow the activity of a more experienced developer.</p>
<h3>Autolinkification</h3>
<p>Bugzilla comments are plain text - so typing <U> will produce less-than, U, greater-than rather than underlined text. However, Bugzilla will automatically make hyperlinks out of certain sorts of text in comments. For example, the text \"http://www.bugzilla.org\" will be turned into a link: http://www.bugzilla.org. Other strings which get linkified in the obvious manner are:</p>

<p>A corollary here is that if you type a bug number in a comment, you should put the word \"bug\" before it, so it gets autolinkified for the convenience of others.</p>
<h3>Is your Bugzilla Butt-Ugly?</h3>
<p>You are probably still using the default theme. This can be easily remedied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click \"Preferencies\" -> \"General Preferences\"</li>
<li>Under \"Bugzilla's general appearance (skin)\" select \"Mozilla\"</li>
</ul>
<p>Now your Bugzilla looks <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2iOCHhJVhE\">sexy and you know it</a>!</p>
<h3>Does your Bugmail make your Eyes Bleed?</h3>
<p>Well, you probably have Bugzilla set up to use the default email format (text):</p>

<p>Switching this to HTML format makes them 1000 times easier to read, especially on a phone. Don't look for it under the \"Email Preferences\" tab though, that would be way too easy.</p>

<h3>Bugzilla Extensions to Rock your World</h3>
<p>There are a few great extensions available that make Bugzilla a more pleasurable experience. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/bugzillajs/\">BugzillaJS</a>: Created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gkoberger\">Gregory Koberger</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rik24d\">Anthony Ricaud</a>. This extension adds keyboard shortcuts, quick file box, inline image / github previews, relative timestamps, Gravatars and more. More information about features is available on the extensions AMO page. This extension contains almost all of Bugzilla Tweak's features and more. You can contribute to the addon <a href=\"https://github.com/gkoberger/BugzillaJS\">here</a></li>
<li><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/bugzilla-tweaks/\">Bugzilla Tweaks</a>: Created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ehsanakhgari\">Ehsan Akhgari</a>, Dave Lawrence and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/globau\">Byron Jones</a>. This extension adds a bunch of features that do not appear to be documented anywhere. These are features such as adding \"Copy Check-in Comment\" to the context menu. If anybody knows how to contribute to this extension then please let me know.</li>
<li><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/github-tweaks-for-bugzilla/\">Github tweaks for Bugzilla</a>: Created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dietrich\">Dietrich Ayala</a>. This extension allows for better Github and Bugzilla integration. On a pull-request page, it adds a new button for submitting the pull-request as an attachment to a bug in bugzilla.mozilla.org. The bug id can be specified by starting your pull request title with \"bug ######\". Your Bugzilla credentials are pulled out of Firefox's password manager. You can contribute to this extension <a href=\"https://github.com/autonome/Github-Bugzilla-Tweaks\">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href=\"http://harthur.github.io/bugzilla-todos/\">Bugzilla TODOs</a>: This is not an extension but a really useful live dashboard created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/harthvader\">Heather Arthur</a>. It contains five tabs (To Review, To Check In, To Nag, To Fix and To Respond) and, because it is live, it is updated automagically. I keep this open as a pinned tab so that I can instantly (via the favicon) see if somebody wants something from me. You can contribute to this handy little web app <a href=\"https://github.com/harthur/bugzilla-todos\">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p>Use attachments, rather than comments, for large chunks of ASCII data, such as trace, debugging output files, or log files. That way, it doesn't bloat the bug for everyone who wants to read it, and cause people to receive fat, useless mails.</p>
<p>Trim screenshots. There's no need to show the whole screen if you are pointing out a single-pixel problem.</p>
<p>Don't attach simple test cases (e.g. one HTML file, one CSS file and an image) as a ZIP file. Instead, upload them in reverse order and edit the referring file so that they point to the attached files. This way, the test case works immediately out of the bug.</p>
<p>Bugzilla stores and uses a Content-Type for each attachment (e.g. text/html). To download an attachment as a different Content-Type (e.g. application/xhtml+xml), you can override this using a 'content-type' parameter on the URL:</p><p>
</p><div class=\"syntax_highlight\"><pre class=\"html5\"><span class=\"sc1\">&content-type=text/plain.</span></pre></div>
<h3>Etiquette</h3>
<p>If you are changing the fields on a bug, only comment if either you have something pertinent to say, or Bugzilla requires it. Otherwise, you may spam people unnecessarily with bug mail. To take an example: a user can set up their account to filter out messages where someone just adds themselves to the CC field of a bug (which happens a lot.) If you come along, add yourself to the CC field, and add a comment saying \"Adding self to CC\", then that person gets a pointless piece of mail they would otherwise have avoided.</p>
<p>Don't use sigs in comments. Signing your name (\"Bill\") is acceptable, if you do it out of habit, but full mail/news-style four line ASCII art creations are not.</p>
<p>You should also read <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html\">Bugzilla’s etiquette guidelines</a> to learn what behaviors are acceptable for Bugzilla users. In general, just be a nice person and everyone will be happy!</p>

This post is a attempt to gather Bugzilla tips from around the Internet whilst adding a few of my own to the list.</p>
<p>To start, if you’ve never used Bugzilla before (or even if you have), you should watch a video <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnath\">johnath</a> made called \"Bugzilla for Humans.\" It gives a really nice overview of key Bugzilla features, as well as tips for more advanced users:</p>
<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\">

</div>
<h3>Quicksearch, I'll Race Ya!</h3>
<p>The most useful tip I know of is to set up a keyword search for the quicksearch box. Open <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/\">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/</a> and right-click the quicksearch box near the top of the page. Select \"Add a keyword for this search…\" and in the keyword field type \"bug.\" You can now search bugzilla using queries like this directly from your Firefox Awesome Bar:</p>
<div class=\"syntax_highlight\"><pre class=\"bash\">bug <span class=\"nu0\">50000</span> <span class=\"co0\"># Open bug 50000.</span></pre></div>
<p>Or even:</p>
<div class=\"syntax_highlight\"><pre class=\"bash\">bug WONTFIX Inspector <span class=\"co0\"># Open bugs containing \"Inspector\" and marked as WONTFIX.</span></pre></div>
<p>Two lists of quicksearch fields are available. A simplified list can be found <a href=\"http://www.squarefree.com/bugzilla/quicksearch-help.html\">here</a> and a more complete list can be found <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=quicksearch.html\">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/beltzner\">Mike Beltzner</a> created an excellent video explaining some of the ways this feature can be used:</p>
<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\">

</div>
<h3>Watching a Component or a Developer</h3>
<p>If you find yourself interested in a certain area of the Mozilla project e.g. Firefox::Developer Tools, you can opt to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=component_watch\">watch its Bugzilla component</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=email\">watch certain users</a>, which is a really neat feature if you’re a new contributor looking to follow the activity of a more experienced developer.</p>
<h3>Autolinkification</h3>
<p>Bugzilla comments are plain text - so typing <U> will produce less-than, U, greater-than rather than underlined text. However, Bugzilla will automatically make hyperlinks out of certain sorts of text in comments. For example, the text \"http://www.bugzilla.org\" will be turned into a link: http://www.bugzilla.org. Other strings which get linkified in the obvious manner are:</p>
<ol>
<li>bug 12345</li>
<li>comment 7</li>
<li>bug 23456, comment 53</li>
<li>attachment 4321</li>
<li>mailto:george@example.com</li>
<li>george@example.com</li>
<li>ftp://ftp.mozilla.org</li>
<li>Most other sorts of URL</li>
</ol>
<p>A corollary here is that if you type a bug number in a comment, you should put the word \"bug\" before it, so it gets autolinkified for the convenience of others.</p>
<h3>Is your Bugzilla Butt-Ugly?</h3>
<p>You are probably still using the default theme. This can be easily remedied:</p>

<h4><strong>Firefox OS doesn’t reach the user by itself</strong></h4>
<p>One important difference that we’ve had to adapt to to develop Firefox OS is that before it reaches the user, an operating system needs to integrate with other parts, created by other organizations. Unlike the browser, the operating system is not something that we give to users by itself. It is only one layer that goes into a mobile phone and it is important that it connects and collaborates with the other parts that make up a phone experience.</p>
<p>That meant that when we thought about the features and functions that we would like to build in a device there were a lot that we had not a lot of influence over, because we were not creating them. Before we could start thinking about where Firefox OS could excel at, we needed to separate its function within a phone and the mobile ecosystem from that of the other players. In other words, we needed to know what is <strong>the job to be done of Firefox OS</strong>.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>There are 5 layers in the mobile ecosystem</strong></h4>
<p>To do this we started breaking down the elements of the mobile ecosystem and define what are the different parts that interact with each other, what is their function and what type of organizations are producing them.</p>
<p>To do this, we looked at what are the steps that content needs to go through from when it’s created by the developer to when it is consumed by the user. A day in the life of content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information is created and stored on servers by <strong>developers</strong> in form of <strong>content</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bytes need to be <strong>transported</strong> to their destination, a job assigned to the <strong>network equipment providers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As a copy of the information leaves the server, it needs to know to which destination to go. It is important that the content is returned to the person who actually asked for it, not to a random one or to the whole network. This job is done by the <strong>network operator</strong>, by means of the IP address, whose key role is that of <strong>authentication</strong> for the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Once it has reached the user, the information still needs to be <strong>processed</strong> on to a screen by a device, which is made by <strong>hardware manufacturers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After it is stored on the hardware, the information is organized and <strong>consumed</strong> by the user through the means of the a <strong>user agent</strong>, which is the operating system. This is where Firefox OS comes in.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h4><strong>Firefox OS is the interface and the data manager for the user</strong></h4>
<p>A user agent is the protective layer between the user and the rest of the ecosystem. It needs to represent the intentions and actions of the end – consumer to the rest of the layers that make up a phone, it needs to translate what is happening at the byte level to the user and in the same time protect against unauthorized access to other data stored on the device.</p>
<p>The <strong>job to be done</strong> of Firefox OS is not one, but several:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is the interface for the user to the entire mobile ecosystem</li>
<li>it represents the user when she wants to interact with the other layers of the phone</li>
<li>it organizes the user’s data</li>
<li>it surfaces the signals sent by the other parts of the phone</li>
<li>it protects the user’s data from unauthorized access</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been using Alembic, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration\">database schema migration</a> tool, for about three months now, and really liking it a lot. I created a blog post that served as a slide deck for an internal team called <a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2013/05/17/migrations-with-alembic-a-lightspeed-tour/\">A lightspeed tour of Alembic</a> as my first stab at user education.</p>
<p>Setting things up initially was pretty simple, but explaining it to a coworker after I’d set everything up for myself proved slightly more difficult. Below are my notes on the differences between <a href=\"http://alembic.readthedocs.org\">Alembic</a> and some other migration tool.</p>
<h4>Terminology</h4>
<p>Alembic calls each migration a <em>revision</em>. Revisions know what order to be run in because each revision is given a <code>down_revision</code> to identify its parent. If <code>down_revision</code> is <code>None</code>, that revision is the very first revision according to Alembic. You can put your whole schema in that revision, or you can just start adding changes to this initial revision. Alembic doesn’t complain either way.</p>
<p>A best practice would likely be putting your entire model into the first revision. I may go back and “fix” this for us later. I opted to just have the default use case be to create a database fresh with a tool we call <code>setupdb_app.py</code>.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to migrate to using alembic, you’ll also need to use SQLAlchemy. I used sqlautocode for my initial schema <a href=\"http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/schema.html#reflecting-database-objects\">reflection</a>, and there’s a new tool <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/agronholm/sqlacodegen/src\">sqlacodegen</a> you may want to check out for generating your SQLAlchemy models for the first time.</p>
<h4>Preparation: edit config and activate a virtualenv</h4>
<p>Our environment was set up per the <a href=\"https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#creating-an-environment\">alembic tutorial for creating an environment</a>. I ran:</p>
<p><code>alembic init alembic</code></p>
<p>I also put an <code>alembic.ini-dist</code> file into our project’s <code>config/</code> directory, and modified <code>alembic/env.py</code> to include our model.</p>
<p>To get started working with an existing install, you’ll need to modify <code>alembic.ini-dist</code>, and copy it to <code>config/alembic.ini</code> to fit your environment – setting the connection string and the path to the alembic directory are the two most important settings. We have a script which creates databases from our <code>models.py</code> called <code>setupdb_app.py</code>. This script takes <code>--database_name</code> as a command-line argument. My default for our project is to use <code>breakpad</code>.</p>
<p>We use a <code>virtualenv</code> called <code>socorro-virtualenv</code>. The virtualenv is created automatically if you run <code>make test</code>. If you’re creating a standalone virtualenv, you can do that with <code>virtualenv socorro-virtualenv</code>. Activate this with <code>. socorro-virtualenv/bin/activate</code>.</p>
<h3>Creating a revision</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a fresh database to work from. For Socorro, the command is: <code>PYTHONPATH=. socorro/external/postgresql/setupdb_app.py --database_name=breakpad</code></li>
<li>Edit <code>models.py</code> with the change to the schema</li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini revision -m 'your message about the migration'</code>. The output will include the name of the new file.</li>
<li>Edit that file as needed <code>alembic/versions/*.py</code></li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini upgrade +1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>If all goes well, your revision is ready! If something goes wrong, edit and try again. The revision will automatically rollback if there are any errors.</p>
<h3>Production deployment</h3>
<p>You’ll need to deploy an <code>alembic.ini</code> on your production database system and probably a <code>virtualenv</code> to support your python modules.</p>
<p>We deploy our virtualenvs with our application, so this step was pretty simple for everything except for alembic itself. The virtualenv put in full, static paths for the python binaries and had some dependencies that I haven’t figured out yet for actually running alembic. To get around this, I created a virualenv locally on the system for the <em>postgres</em> user. Having your postgres user run the migrations locally is a must for me because I need to access the filesystem to pull in new versions of user defined functions stashed in the directory my model lives in.</p>
<p>I just deploy a new release of our application code on the database server locally, and then I run alembic against the <code>versions</code> directory that’s deployed.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>And here’s an FAQ for the common problems folks ran into:</p>
<h4>OOPS I forgot to create a database before I created a revision!</h4>
<p>To “fix” this, try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the database from scratch using your current <code>models.py</code>.</li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini downgrade -1</code></li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini upgrade +1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming your downgrade function works, this should allow you reverse the latest revision and then test your migration.</p>
<h4>Error message: “Only a single head supported so far.”</h4>
<p>See <a href=\"https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#working-with-branches\">Working with Branches</a>.</p>
<h4>I’m using schemas, and alembic doesn’t recognize them when I try to use <code>--autogenerate</code>.</h4>

For example, several language software packages are named after it, such as the <a href=\"http://www.babylon.com\">Babylon</a> electronic dictionary, <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Babel\">MediaWiki’s Babel extension</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_fish_%28The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy%29#Babel_fish\">Babelfish translation service</a> (itself named after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_fish_%28The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy%29#Babel_fish\">Babel fish from The Hitchhiker’s Guide</a>).</p>
<p>In this post I shall use the Tower of Babel in a somewhat more relevant and specific way: It will speak about multilingualism and about Babel itself.</p>
<p>This is how most people saw the Wikipedia article about the Tower of Babel until today:</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2183\" style=\"width: 461px;\"><a href=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-tofu1.png\"><img alt=\"The Tower of Babel article. Notice the pointless squares in the Akkadian name. They are called \"tofu\" in the jargon on internationalization programmers.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2183\" src=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-tofu1.png?w=500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The tower of Babel. Notice the pointless squares in the Akkadian name. They are called “tofu” in the jargon on internationalization programmers.</p></div>
<p>And this is how most people will see it from today:</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2184\" style=\"width: 479px;\"><a href=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-cuneiform.png\"><img alt=\"And we have the name written in real Akkadian cuneiform!\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2184\" src=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-cuneiform.png?w=500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">And we have the name written in real Akkadian cuneiform!</p></div>
<p>Notice how the Akkadian name now appears as actual Akkadian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform\">cuneiform</a>, and not as meaningless squares. Even if you, like most people, cannot actually read cuneiform, you probably understand that showing it this way is more correct, useful and educational.</p>
<p>This is possible thanks to the webfonts technology, which was enabled on the English Wikipedia today. It was already enabled in Wikipedias in some languages for many months, mostly in languages of India, which have severe problems with font support in the common operating systems, but now it’s available in the English Wikipedia, where it mostly serves to show parts of text that are written in exotic fonts.</p>
<p>The current iteration of the webfonts support in Wikipedia is part of a larger project: the Universal Language Selector (ULS). I am very proud to be one of its developers. My team in Wikimedia developed it over the last year or so, during which it underwent a rigorous process of design, testing with dozens of users from different countries, development, bug fixing and deployment. In addition to webfonts it provides an easy way to pick the user interface language, and to type in non-English languages (the latter feature is disabled by default in the English Wikipedia; to enable it, click the cog icon near “Languages” in the sidebar, then click “Input” and “Enable input tools”). In the future it will provide even more abilities, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>If you edit Wikipedia, or want to try editing it, one way in which you could help with the deployment of webfonts would be to make sure that all foreign strings in Wikipedia are marked with the appropriate HTML lang attribute; for example, that every Vietnamese string is marked as <span lang=”vi” dir=”ltr”>. This will help the software apply the webfonts correctly, and in the future it will also help spelling and hyphenation software, etc.</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be possible without the help of many, many people. The developers of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Opera, who developed the support for webfonts in these browsers; The people in Wikimedia who designed and developed the ULS: Alolita Sharma, Arun Ganesh, Brandon Harris, Niklas Laxström, Pau Giner, Santhosh Thottingal and Siebrand Mazeland; The many volunteers who tested ULS and reported useful bugs; The people in Unicode, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Everson\">Michael Everson</a>, who work hard to give a number to every letter in every imaginable alphabet and make massive online multilingualism possible; And last but not least, the talented and generous people who developed all those fonts for the different scripts and released them under Free licenses. I send you all my deep appreciation, as a developer and as a reader of Wikipedia.</p>

I had recently joined Mozilla, and about one or two months in, a wiki page surfaced. It was called <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2g\">B2G</a>.</p>
<h3>The beginning</h3>
<p>B2G stod for Boot to Gecko, a name implying that you would boot into Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, and a codename that stuck around for about a year. Apparently it was about building a mobile operating system based on, and targeted at, the Open Web. The wiki page took most of us by surprise, including our Press  and Evangelism team, since it got some traction in press before we got briefed about what it actually was. We scurried around and had meetings to come to a conclusion to what it actually was.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://robertnyman.com/images/1307/b2g-wiki-page.png\" /></p>
<p>Almost two years ago I wrote my first article for the Mozilla Hacks blog about it: <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/07/announcing-boot-to-gecko-b2g-booting-to-the-web/\">Announcing Boot to Gecko (B2G) – Booting to the Web</a>.</p>
<p>Over time, the project developed and a lot of things were ironed out, in establishing what the main focus would be, what the core undertaking encompassed and how to move forward.</p>
<h3>What it really is</h3>
<p>The idea with Firefox OS is to develop a mobile platform that is completely open, and which gives a lot more possibilities to developers, partners and, ultimately, consumers. As I’ve stated many times, the idea is not to compete with iPhones and high-end Android phones, but rather to offer an alternative to emerging markets. How can people who have no phones, or old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone\">feature phones</a>, get access to a smartphone for a really low cost?</p>
<p>How can we continue to ensure that the Internet is as democratic as it can be, that as many as possible can take part and contribute without having to pay many hundreds of US dollars to just get in through the front door?</p>
<p>There’s an estimate of two billion (!) more people coming online in the next few years, and a vast majority of them will do it through mobile. How can we help them, give them affordable options?</p>
<p>We at Mozilla believe we can do that through a completely open device, enabling everyone to contribute to it, afford it and also inspire and influence other players in the mobile field to make their devices more open, more powerful when it comes to the Open Web and priced at a realistic level.</p>
<h4>True open source</h4>
<p>From day one, the repository was available on GitHub. Day one. Everything that has been developed since then has been real-time, and possible for anyone to see, analyze and contribute to. The project first lived in a person’s own repository, but was then moved into a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G\">Mozilla one</a>.</p>
<h3>Introducing WebAPIs</h3>
<p>My own belief – and I’ve stated this many times – is that where I personally think Apple took the wrong path was with how to build things for the iPhone. With the first version they said that all should be the web and you could access it through the mobile Safari web browser. The problem was, of course, that no web site could access anything on the device, like contacts, camera etc. Basically, while the iPhone was a massive leap forward for mobile phones, developers were less than excited with the lack of possibilities for them to build things.</p>
<p>Then Apple went down the path with Objective-C, The App Store and the rest is history. I much more wish that they had chosen to make the web part much stronger, give it access to local device APIs and evolve into the powerful platform it deserves to be. But alas, that didn’t happen, and they went with their own closed and proprietary approach.</p>
<p>So, someone else had to make it happen. In August of 2011, I wrote the <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/08/introducing-webapi/\">first blog post about our WebAPIs iniative at Mozilla</a>, which targeted just that need of improving access for the web layer. Since then I’ve written a number of articles about various APIs and our dedication to standardize these – because if we only did it for us, we wouldn’t do the best for the Open Web.</p>
<p>My most extensive post on APIs was <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/02/using-webapis-to-make-the-web-layer-more-capable/\">Using WebAPIs to make the web layer more capable</a>, which I believe is a good introduction to just how many things you can do from the web layer.</p>
<h3>Apps – what are they and do we need them?</h3>
<p>With Apple’s move with the App Store, <em>everyone</em> wanted to create their own store, where they had complete control, their own APIs and with the goal of making a lot of money. Which is fair, they are businesses and they protect their interests.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe the web and just using URLs to get something is the most powerful thing we have, and something we should cherish and protect for the future. And then if you need a shortcut (bookmarks, anyone?) you can add a web page/URL to your home screen and that’s it.</p>
<p>Users will gain from this and developers will need to build with one technology – the web – instead of having a separate team for each mobile platform. With Firefox OS, the goal has not been to have developers learn something from scratch, but rather utilize and reuse heir existing Open Web technologies.</p>
<p>Since user’s have gotten so used to apps, we are offering that possibility in Firefox OS as well, but have made sure that it’s based on the Open Web (I’ve written more in detail about this in <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/02/getting-started-with-open-web-apps-why-and-how/\">Getting started with Open Web Apps – why and how</a>).</p>
<p>We also have a <a href=\"https://marketplace.firefox.com/\">Firefox Marketplace</a> where you can submit your apps, for findability, payments and more. What’s crucial to know here, though is that you don’t have to build an app if you don’t want to, you don’t have to use the Marketplace – apps are installable from anywhere. Over time, we hope that other people can create their own dedicated Marketplaces as well, for certain topics or local interests.</p>
<p>You could just as well continue to build your own mobile HTML5 web site – with Responsive Design, of course – and you will be good to go on Firefox OS. I see apps an optional approach, not the one and only. The choice is <em>yours</em>.</p>
<h4>Finding mobile web sites that are only on the web</h4>
<p>Also, for users, if you swipe to the left from the home screen in Firefox OS, you will get to the <a href=\"http://blog.everything.me/2013/02/25/exciting-times-at-everything-me/\">integrated Everything.me service</a> – finding mobile web sites out there that you can test first, and then pin to your home screen if you want to.</p>
<h3>Along came Web Activities</h3>
<p>With above mentioned WebAPIs, there are some things on a mobile that are to sensitive to expose and give complete access to, like telephony or SMS. But, naturally there are use cases where you’d want to trigger and interact with them from your content or app. Therefore, we <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/01/introducing-web-activities/\">introduced Web Activities</a>, which gives you a simple and powerful way to do just that, and with a connected user experience and approval.</p>
<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://robertnyman.com/images/1307/Web-Activities.png\" /></p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>It has also been interesting to see how tools and options have developed, to test this open platform in a simple and lightweight manner. I’m tremendously grateful for the work by Myk Melez and others on the <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/firefox-os-simulator-3-0-released/\">Firefox OS Simulator</a>, and I’ve happy to have been able to help developers by creating the <a href=\"https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App\">Firefox OS Boilerplate App</a> – all based on developers’ needs and input.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App-new-UI.png\" /></a></p>
<h3>When it took off</h3>
<p>When it really got exciting, and things started to take off, was about six months after the initial announcement. It was time for the massive <a href=\"http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/\">Mobile World Conference</a> in Barcelona, <em>the</em> place to be at if you were doing something in the mobile sector.</p>
<p>I watched it from afar, and tried to assist the announcements and attention with writing about it in <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/mozillas-boot-to-gecko-the-web-is-the-platform/\">Mozilla’s Boot to Gecko – The Web is the Platform</a> and <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/gaia-mozillas-user-interface-for-boot-to-gecko-all-web-technologies/\">Gaia, Mozilla’s user interface for Boot to Gecko – all web technologies</a>. It gained an enormous interest and from then, it has been busy days.</p>
<h3>Mobile World Conference, anno 2013</h3>
<p>This year I decided to go to Mobile World Congress, I had to be a part of what was going on. And it was such a wonderful and extremely intense experience! Working from early morning till <em>late</em> nights, talking, learning, sharing. It was wonderful to see all the interest and hope around Firefox OS, something that I believe must be somewhat akin to the 1.0 release of Firefox. How can we create something open and make a difference?</p>

<h3>Today’s the day</h3>
<p>Yesterday <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/07/01/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">we announced that the first Firefox OS devices are coming into the market</a>, and today the very first devices will be available for sale in Madrid, Spain. There are a number of other countries and places to be announced in the very near future, and with a lot of hardware and operator partners, this is so exciting!</p>
<p>There has been so much hard work by so many people going into this: to make it work, to get through the hard times, to seal the the deals, to understand, educate and inspire developers. A lot of effort has gone into this, but for me, I don’t regret one second. And <strong>thank you</strong> to eveyone for all your contributions to this project!</p>
<p>I was there day one. I was along for the entire ride, from the first code commit to seeing the actual devices being launched, to people owning them. It has been a magic experience, and frankly, I’m a bit touched. Within one’s career, I don’t believe many get the chances to be there from the initial spark to the the launch of a completely new mobile operating system.</p>
<p>And this is not the end. It has just begun.</p>

I figured it was about time I'd update people reading along with some of the stuff that I've been working on lately(of course with the help of the rest of the Graphics team and others!). I will be using the term Moz2D in this post to refer to our new graphics API that was formerly known under the name 'Azure'.</p>
<p><strong>Moz2D Stand-Alone Build & Repository</strong></p>
<p>In order to make it easier for both ourselves, partners and potential 3rd parties interested in using Moz2D to build and work with the Moz2D API, I now have a stand-alone repository that contains the Moz2D basic library code, the player and some testing applications. The exact status of this repository is still to be determined, and no automation is applied to it yet, however we are making sure it keeps building and remains up to date! It can be found <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/users/bschouten_mozilla.com/moz2d/\">here</a>. Some basic build instructions are available <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX#Testing.2C_replaying.2C_building_Moz2D\">here</a>, I will try to post more detailed build information, also for the different dependencies such as Cairo and Skia, somewhere in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Direct2D 1.1 Integration</strong></p>
<p>We've been working towards a Direct2D 1.1 backend in Moz2D. Direct2D 1.1 was included with Windows 8 and is provided as an update to Windows 7 users. It includes a wide range of API additions, several of which give us the ability to implement the Moz2D feature set with reduced and cleaner code. In addition to that some of the API additions should promise some performance improvements. We have refrained from using some of the new APIs in the Direct2D 1.1 implementation as of yet however, since at the moment they seem to increase the complexity without offering the expected performance benefits. As we begin rolling out Direct2D 1.1 integration to actual firefox users I'll attempt to provide more information on what we discover along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Moz2D Recording & Performance Analysis Improvements</strong></p>
<p>Another thing that we've been working on has been increased recording abilities as well as an increased ability to get useful information out of these recordings. Although the priority for this has been relatively low, steady improvements are being made and it has proven to be a large asset in the creation of new Moz2D backends.</p>
<p>First of all it's now possible to create a recording of a specific page using a single command when using Firefox nightly, an example looks like this (assuming 'recording' is a valid, clean profile of firefox):</p>
<blockquote><p>firefox -no-remote -P recording -recording file://C:\\Users\\Bas\\Dev\\mytest.html -recording-output mytest.aer</p></blockquote>
<p>We're currently still working out some problems which will often cause recordings to be terminated prematurely and therefore come up empty. But this should be fairly easy to fix. Do note this needs to be done on a system where Moz2D content is enabled, for now, this is only windows, although it should soon include OS X as well!</p>
<p>Once the recording is completed several (experimental) possibilities have been added. First of all the Moz2D player has gotten additional features, see a screenshot below for the updated look:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.basschouten.com/media/blogs/blog/azure/player2dscr.png\"><img alt=\"Player2D Screenshot\" src=\"http://www.basschouten.com/media/blogs/blog/azure/player2dscr.png\" title=\"Player 2D (click for a larger version!)\" width=\"450\" /><br />Click for a larger version</a></p>
<p>Note that it's now possible to replay the recording with different drawing backends (depending on your build). This easily makes it possible when adding backends to find flaws in new implementations by comparing drawing results with established backends. We've also added the possibility to analyze timings on a per-call basis to find performance bottlenecks for different backends. In addition to that a separate application called 'recordbench' has been added which is in a very early stage, this essentially is a very simple tool that reports timings for a recording across a range of backends. Trough this application we should be able to do automated performance comparisons between different drawing backends.</p>

The performance team also joined us as there are various joint projects between our teams. After the week is over it’s interesting to look back and see what was accomplished during the week and what it opened as guidance for our future work. Here is my personal recap, some of the highlights of what I did and what I saw during the week. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally met with Irving, with whom I’ve been working in the past few months in our project to move the Add-ons Manager storage from SQLite to JSON and making it off-main-thread (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853389\">bug 853389</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853388\">bug 853388</a>)</li>
<li>We did a triage of performance-related bugs to classify them into high impact and low impact and figure out where to focus</li>
<li>Got to see some of the great progress that Tim Taubert and Avi has done on the tabstrip animations and got Tim to help me use the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=453650\">reflow observers</a> to do some experiments of my own in the UI. I didn’t find any obvious low hanging fruits, which is expected since he has fixed various offenders since introducing these reflows observers, but the attempt was worthwhile</li>
<li>Using the profiler I noticed some long stacks for text reflowing during tab animations, but these didn’t translate into any measurable slowness. In any case, I started some hacking to see if it was possible to improve it anyway. The issue is that the title in a tab has to be constantly remeasured for cropping while a tab opening animation is happening. I wrote a patch to only display the tab title and favicon after the animation has completed, and then got together with Avi to run his tab animation FPS tests and see what changes. The answer was: not much, there were no visible gains. In hindsight, there’s an obvious reason: even though we can hide the text in the tab that is opening, we can’t do it for the other open tabs, which will all be potentially shrinking and re-cropping at the same time. However, the investigation was very useful nonetheless, because we discovered two issues with the APIs used to measure the FPS on Mac: a telemetry measurement have been inactive since OMTC has been activated; and the framerate was always stuck on vsynced even with different values for layout.frame_rate (which is useful to tweak when doing animation stress tests)</li>
<li>Got together with Paolo to discuss the plans and current state of the Downloads API off-main-thread project, which I’ll be joining to help (starting with <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=852482\">bug 852482</a>)</li>
<li>Watched Vladan present his findings about <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/vdjeric/2013/05/01/running-nightly-23-from-an-sd-card/\">running Firefox on an SD card</a>. I had already seem the video through his blog post but watching it again and going into more details was very interesting, as the extreme slow disk IO is not only an artificial case produced on SD cards, but also something that many users have to face daily on machines with older hard drives and anti-virus software than can significantly worsen the problems.</li>
<li>Vladan’s talk was also of particular interest to me as it serves as motivation and validation for the work I’ve been involved with in the last significant number of months: the Add-ons Manager work and now the Downloads API.</li>
<li>And various converstations about <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis\">Electrolysis</a>, including a good talk with Yoric to understand how the ongoing work on session restore and e10s will interact</li>
</ul>
<p>And beyond that there were also various other topics that benefited from having the team all together in one place, specially Social API and Australis. To me personally the week was immensely helpful as a motivator and as a way to get consensus and clarity into our upcoming projects, not to mention the fine chance of directly interacting with the entire team which not often happens as we’re all spread around the around!</p>
<p>As a side note, this blog post was an exercise in itself as one of the outcomes for me from the Summit Assembly meeeting we had at the week before. There’s more on it that needs a separate blog post to explain, but a personal action that I’ve taken from that event is to increase the transparency and involvement with the community about the work I do.</p>

<p>I just switched from an Android phablet made by Samsung, device I came to hate for many reasons, to a Firefox OS Geeksphone Keon. That was my second Android phone, I switched because I got it for free<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/pnote-839-1\" id=\"rev-pnote-839-1\">1</a>]</sup>, needed a carrier that worked better than the failure that is WIND Mobile on which I was using my Nexus One<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/pnote-839-2\" id=\"rev-pnote-839-2\">2</a>]</sup> and said Nexus One was just abandoned in OS upgrade by HTC AND Google after 22 month. I have to admit I missed the Nexus One, still, as Samsung didn't make Android better, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Back to the point. I got that Geeksphone Keon, provided by my employer: Mozilla.</p>
<p>This is not a review of the phone, BTW, and all of this also applies to the <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/07/01/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">just released Firefox OS phone in Spain</a>.</p>
<p>On my Android phablet<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/pnote-839-3\" id=\"rev-pnote-839-3\">3</a>]</sup> I used 4 applications: the web browser, a twitter client (not Twitter's own though), Instagram and Foursquare.</p>
<p>On my Firefox OS phone, I had to scrap the last two. Why? Because despite requiring an internet connection and having some sort of web interface, their are unusable on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Web browser</strong></p>
<p>On Android I used Firefox for Android as my web browser. It is currently the best solution for web browsing is designed to protect your privacy and to run on more devices than Google's own Chrome. Call me biased if you want but truth is I have been using Firefox on the desktop too.</p>
<p>Firefox OS web browser is basically the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong></p>
<p>Twitter is a bit hurtfull. It is designed from the ground up to be used as a web application. Twitter has a mobile version that is meant to work well on small screen. They even have a packaged version for the Firefox OS Marketplace. Where it hurts is that Twitter web UI remains awful, either deliberately (given that the iOS client is awfull too) or because we got spoiled by third-party clients. On Android I was using Twicca (no source code) or Twidere (broke a bit at one point), but it should be noted that Twitter gave the finger to third parties when they added restriction on the development of client ; as well as bickering with Instagram to not show their content inline.</p>
<p>They get almost full marks for being a web app and treating it as first class.</p>
<p><strong>Foursquare</strong></p>
<p>On the desktop, if you go to Foursquare you get a decent web application, albeit you can do the major feature that Foursquare calls for: check-in.</p>
<p>On mobile, if I visit the website on Firefox for Android I get prompted to download an app.</p>
<p>On Firefox OS it is worse. Looks like their detection fail and they offer the desktop website that is mostly unusable on such a small screen. I filed <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=878132\">bug 878132</a> for our tech evangelism to eventually have a look at.</p>
<p>Seems like they didn't go all the way to make it relevant on mobile web. Sadly. What was an experiment I started by the end of last year when I signed up for the service stopped here right at Firefox OS. It seems that I don't need it. They lost a user.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong></p>
<p>This one is the worst of the worst. First and foremost their web interface for desktop is very limited. Secondly, it doesn't scale at all on mobile - some content scale better than other. Third, they bickered with Twitter so that their content is not viewable inline.</p>
<p>Why does that last one matter? Try viewing the instagram content in the Twitter mobile web client.</p>
<p>I give a F as a mark.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Simply make your mobile app web based. It will run on iOS, Android, Firefox OS, Blackberry, etc. and people will be able to follow when they change phone and you won't need to spend a lot of resources for each platforms.</p>
<p>Also if you really want to have a packaged app, remember there are technologies like <a href=\"http://phonegap.com/\">PhoneGap</a> whose purpose is exactly that.</p>

<p>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/rev-pnote-839-2\" id=\"pnote-839-2\">2</a>] first and foremost I didn't have service at the office downtown. second I was in the process of moving to Montréal where they don't have service anyway</p>

The Learning team has been reorganised (twice!) so I’m now on the Badges Team v2.0. Things certainly don’t move slowly in the tech world.</p>

<p>Initially, I planned for this post to include an epic infographic showing all of the places I’ve been, the people I’ve talked to, and so on. But that task would take a whole day of my time – and that’s time I haven’t got! Working at Mozilla is exciting, but busy. Suffice to say that <strong>I’ve attended 53 events in the 52 weeks I’ve been at Mozilla</strong> and I’ve usually been speaking at or running workshops at them. When you factor in Christmas shutdown at PTO (a.k.a. holiday) then that’s pretty impressive/scary.</p>
<p>I’ve been many places this past year evangelising Mozilla’s mission and, in particular, the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI). I’ve been to Canada (twice), several places in the US, the Netherlands (twice), Belgium, Portugal, Ireland, all over the UK… the list goes on. That sounds great but, as any business traveller will tell you, you don’t usually get to do the touristy things; most of what you see is the inside of airports, hotels, planes, trains and automobiles. Having said that, it beats sitting at the same desk day-in, day-out. <img alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> </p>

<p>I’m often asked what it’s like to work for Mozilla. As people ask that question their eyes often light up as if it’s a magic wonderland. It’s <em>not</em> unicorns and rainbows all the time and I certainly recognise the ‘inability to switch off’ problem that Rob Hawkes mentioned in his post upon <a href=\"http://rawkes.com/articles/on-leaving-mozilla\">leaving Mozilla</a>. In that post he talked about stress and burnout as well. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it) I experienced stress, burnout and working crazy hours as a teacher and senior leader while still in my 20′s. That means both I and my family are well-equipped to spot and deal with the tell-tale signs of stress. I know when to rest and how to look after myself these days.</p>
<p>But working at Mozilla is, if not a magic wonderland, certainly <em>different </em>and<em> pretty awesome</em>. I’ve never experienced such freedom and devolved responsibility as I do here. Nor have I ever worked with people who are so talented, motivated and great at communicating using technology. It’s also wonderful knowing that you’re playing a part in making a difference on a global scale. <em>Especially</em> with the work that I’m involved in around <a href=\"http://openbadges.org\">Open Badges</a> and the <a href=\"http://mzl.la/weblitstd\">Web Literacy Standard</a> I feel like this is stuff that could significantly improve the educational and career opportunities of the next generation. Given that’s my children’s generation, it makes me proud to work for a global non-profit where <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/\">doing good is part of our code</a>.</p>

One thing of interest mentioned in the announcement today was “One of our<a href=\"http://www.appcelerator.com/thinkmobile/surveys/\"> recent surveys</a> found Firefox OS to be more compelling to developers over Tizen, Blackberry and Kindle Fire” and I totally agree with this.

When enterprises (and others) are customizing Firefox, I get asked pretty much the same questions every time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I disable private browsing?</li>
<li>How do I turn off Firefox Sync?</li>
<li>How do I prevent access to about:config?</li>
<li>How do I prevent the installation of add-ons?</li>
<li>How do I prevent access to the add-ons manager?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Doing any of these things properly is actually quite difficult, because none of the people that developed these features ever thought that someone would want to disable them. I think the primary reason for this is that most people that create software have only ever experienced how one type of person uses a computer. They believe that everyone uses a computer like they do; they have full access to the computer, they can do whatever they want and they can customize the computer however they want. This narrow view causes them to create software for people like them.
</p>
<p>
The reality is that people use computers in many different ways. In many industries, organizations, governments and educational institutions, there is a need to prevent people from having too much access to the computer and the browser. And it's not just things like kiosks. It could be shared computers at a hospital or bank, or it could be simply that the employees are not very computer literate and you want to make sure they have limited access. Or maybe the browser is used on a piece of equipment and you want to make sure it can't be messed with. There are tons of reasons why someone would want to disable certain features.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you create a new feature, you should ask yourself this questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there a good reason why someone would want to disable this feature?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is yes, you should provide a single global preference that removes the entire feature. You should also ensure that when this preference is locked, any associated UI associated with that feature is disabled.
</p>
<p>
Asking this simple question before implementing a new feature will go a long way towards making sure Firefox is enterprise ready.</p>" nil nil "568dfdcf857b45149ebc48f1afda8c0a") (259 (20949 15560 830481) "https://brendaneich.com/2013/07/firefox-os-launches/" "Brendan Eich: Firefox OS Launches" "Brendan Eich" "Mon, 01 Jul 2013 14:56:48 +0000" "<p>Just under two years ago, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/dmip1GpD5II/CzJSSUMq5HsJ\">we started</a> <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/os/\">Firefox OS</a> as the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G\">Boot to Gecko (B2G)</a> project, with little more than a belief that the Web should be the only platform you need to build an open mobile device ecosystem.

I worked with the system, I helped developers port their apps to it and I spend hours and hours writing about it, making demos and talking to the press and anyone who’d stand still long enough (or sit on a plane next to me). Today I got my reward with the FirefoxOS movement going from “Idea” via “Prototype” to “Developer Preview” and now “Launch”.</p>
<p>As announced today on the Mozilla blog <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/press/2013/07/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">Mozilla and Partners Prepare to Launch First Firefox <span class=\"caps\">OS </span>Smartphones</a> and by prepare this means adding the shiny bow to the boxes containing phones that end users will be able to buy.</p>
<p>According to the <a href=\"http://pressoffice.telefonica.com/jsp/base.jsp?contenido=/jsp/notasdeprensa/notadetalle.jsp&id=0&origen=portada&idm=eng&pais=1&elem=20030\">Telefonica blog announcement</a> this will be very soon indeed and the offer is pretty amazing:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Movistar to offer the <span class=\"caps\">ZTE </span>Open for €69, including €30 of balance for prepaid customers and a 4GB microSD card.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Not only is the price very competitive, you <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu8q-oISbas\">get a great phone for that</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve said this many times before, but let me now here repeat the things that really get me excited like a 5 year old on sugar rush about Firefox OS:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Firefox OS kills the idea of mobile web connectivity only being for the rich in the western world.</strong> Yes, for us in the US or the UK having a new shiny phone every half year is not an issue as companies are killing each other trying to underbid the price and offers of the others. But a usable Android that is not generations behind and hard-wired to a terrible stock browser or an iPhone is just not affordable to everyone. Even worse, if you have no credit card you couldn’t even buy apps for them. This is unfair, elitist and plainly against anything the web stands for. FirefoxOS is affordable, and apps can be bought on prepay or on your phone bill and the OS is the browser which means updates are easy</li><li><strong>FirefoxOS does not assume a fast, stable and always available connection</strong>. When traveling I start hating my Android phone which I love to bits otherwise. Having dozens of megabyte updates over roaming is out of the question and neither is using flaky and slow wireless connections. Firefox OS has no native apps – all of them, including the system apps are written in <span class=\"caps\">HTML</span>, CSS and JavaScript. Thus they are much smaller and can have atomic updates instead of having to be replaced as a unit every single time.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS is the web in your pocket.</strong> It is Firefox and nothing else (other than a Linux core to access the hardware). Thus I will not be told to “download the native app” when I go to web sites that are perfectly fine to use.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS is the platform <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> deserves</strong> For developers, our <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> solutions are finally first-class citizens. We are not shoved into a slower web view and told we can not access the hardware.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS apps are web distributed apps.</strong> Users can go to the marketplace and find our apps by hand or via review or they could search for a certain song, movie, football team and dish and find our app that way. App discovery is as simple as using the web and finding web sites. Instead of having to pay as a developer and be at the mercy of the T&C of closed marketplaces I can publish a Firefox OS app by adding a button and calling the open web apps <span class=\"caps\">API</span>. That way my current web site is the ad for my app and all my visitors potential app users.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>All of this is obvious to me as a geek but doesn’t mean anything if we don’t get devices in the hands of end users. And this is what happens now – big time! Alcatel, <span class=\"caps\">ZTE</span>, Telefonica, Deutsche Telekom, Spain and Poland. The fox really is out of the bag now. And oh how it will roam and run into many other directions. Be part of this, as a web developer, it is the most rewarding platform that will not change from under you at the whim of company goals or shareholder demands.</p>" nil nil "70733f89d35c71d5b4faa8472167d364") (257 (20949 15560 829198) "https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2013/07/01/success-and-firefox-os/" "Mitchell Baker: Success and Firefox OS" "mitchell" "Mon, 01 Jul 2013 11:49:46 +0000" "<p>Firefox OS is <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/07/01/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">launching today</a>.  With that in mind, it’s a good time to recap why Mozilla builds products, what our products represent and how our products relate to our goals.</p>
<p>Mozilla’s goal is to build openness, innovation, and opportunity into online life.   One of our biggest levers is of course building products.   We build products that provide a great user experience and engender openness, innovation and opportunity into the technology of the Web itself.</p>
<p>Firefox has done this in many ways.  Firefox was a pioneer in the world of open source consumer products, in open techniques for feedback, support, and quality, just to name a few examples.  We have always built Firefox to give developers huge opportunities for innovation in areas they care about.  We do not seek to control the ways developers can innovate, or the way people take control of their software.</p>
<p>As a result, Firefox helped usher in a whole new era of Web computing, bringing new experiences for users and new freedoms for developers.  Today Firefox continues to pioneer new technologies and features that benefit users.  Some recent examples include features such as Do Not Track, which allows people to tell websites they do not wish to be tracked around the Web, and our Social API that makes the browsing experience more personal and customizable.</p>
<p>With Firefox OS we hope to do something similar with the mobile computing environment.  We want to bring the power of the open Web to this world.  We want to bring the same kinds of flexibility, opportunity and freedom to this computing environment that the original Firefox brings to the desktop.  More specifically, we want  Firefox OS to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prove that the Web is the platform, surprise people with what HTML5 is capable of on mobile devices.</li>
<li>Advance adoption of mobile Web standards and APIs across the industry, including on other operating systems.</li>
<li>Spur developer innovation; break the mold of what a mobile app is capable of.</li>
<li>Make the open Web accessible to more people.</li>
<li>Spur competition in making the Web the platform for mobile computing.</li>
<li>Excite people.</li>
<li>Provide a powerful, exciting and open alternative to the current closed ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll note that I haven’t included something like “we want to ship X numbers of phones.”  Ultimately, we want enough people choosing Firefox OS to confirm we’ve built a great product and to move us toward  a more open mobile computing platform based on the Web.    Our goal is to provide an alternative that has a deep and exciting user experience based on openness, choice and competition.</p>" nil nil "1134628c3ae09e24a50dd206782c6061") (256 (20949 15560 828638) "http://mcc.id.au/blog/2013/07/firefox-svg-text-improvements" "Cameron McCormack: Improved SVG text support in Firefox Nightly" "Cameron McCormack" "Mon, 01 Jul 2013 08:48:19 +0000" "<p>On the weekend, I landed the final patch in what turned out to be quite a long running project to overhaul Firefox’s SVG text support to reuse the same text layout and rendering code that it uses for HTML.

<p>Improvements resulting from this work include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration\">text-decoration</a>’ property is now honoured, so underlines, strike-throughs and overlines are painted.</li>

<li>Text can be selected with the mouse.</li>
<li>Layout of bidirectional text when there are multiple child nodes of a <code><text></code> element is now correct.</li>
<li>The ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space\">white-space</a>’ property now applies to SVG text.  In the future, in SVG 2, ‘white-space’ will be recommended method to control white space handling rather than <code>xml:space=\"\"</code>.  ‘white-space’ can be used to render manually wrapped text when using the <code>pre</code> and <code>pre-line</code> values.  ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height\">line-height</a>’ is used to determine the spacing between lines.</li>
<li>Various <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-fonts/\">CSS3 Font properties</a>, including the new ‘font-variant’ related properties to turn on and off OpenType features, now apply to SVG text.</li>
<li>The <code>:first-letter</code> and <code>:first-line</code> pseudo-elements now apply to SVG text.</li>

The data collected was largely what we call <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis\">traffic analysis</a></em> data: who talked to whom, where, when, using what mechanism.  It was mostly <em>not</em> the actual contents of the conversations, but so much can be deduced from “who talked to whom, when” that this should not reassure you in the slightest.  If you haven’t seen the demonstration that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/06/prism_metadata_analysis_paul_revere_identified_by_his_connections_to_other.single.html\">just by compiling and correlating membership lists, the British government could have known that Paul Revere would’ve been a good person to ask pointed questions about revolutionary plots in the colonies in 1772</a>, go read that now.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s safe to assume we know <em>anything</em> about the <em>details</em> of this data collection: especially not the degree of cooperation the government obtained from telcos and other private organizations.  There are too many layers of secrecy involved, there’s probably no one who has the complete picture of what the various three-letter agencies were <em>supposed</em> to be doing (let alone what they actually <em>were</em> doing), and there’s too many people trying to bend the narrative in their own preferred direction.  However, I also don’t think the details matter all that much at this stage.  That the program existed, and was successful enough that the NSA was bragging about it in an internal PowerPoint deck, is enough for the immediate conversation to go forward.  (The details may become very important later, though: especially details about who got to make use of the data collected.)</p>
<p>Lots of other people have been writing about why this program is a Bad Thing: Most critically, large traffic-analytic databases are <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/174851/strange-case-barrett-brown#ixzz2X1oYM1xV\">easy to abuse for politically-motivated witch hunts</a>, which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover#Investigation_of_subversion_and_radicals\">can and have occurred in the US in the past</a>, and arguably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/26/nsa-revelations-response-to-smears\">are now occurring as a reaction to the leaks</a>.  One might also be concerned that this <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/06/preventing_cell.html\">makes it harder to pursue other security goals</a>; that it gives other countries an incentive to partition the Internet along national boundaries, <a href=\"http://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2013/06/provoking-national-boundaries-internet-chilling-thought\">harming its resilience</a>; or that it <a href=\"https://medium.com/surveillance-state/f77088fd4c28\">further harms the US’s image abroad</a>, which was already not doing that well; or that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/29/tomorrows-surveillance/\">the <em>next</em> surveillance program will be even worse if this one isn’t stopped</a>.
(Nothing new under the sun: Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis’ argument in “<a href=\"http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/Brandeisprivacy.htm\">The Right to Privacy</a>” in 1890 is still as good an explanation as any you’ll find of why the government should not spy on the general public.)</p>
<p>I want to talk about something a little different; I want to talk about why the <em>secrecy</em> of these ubiquitous surveillance programs is at least as harmful to good governance as the programs themselves.</p>

<h3>Secrecy culture</h3>
<p><a href=\"http://www.owlfolio.org/media/2013/06/loose-lips-sink-ships-posters2.jpg\"><img alt=\"World War II-era propaganda poster of sinking steamship with the words “Loose LIPS Sink Ships” superimposed.\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1514\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.owlfolio.org/media/2013/06/loose-lips-sink-ships-posters2-196x300.jpg\" width=\"196\" /></a></p>
<p>If you’ve had any exposure at all to the US military-industrial complex, you will have noticed two things: its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/jun/12/prism-nsa-powerpoint-graphic-design\">institutional idiom of horrible PowerPoint slide decks</a>, and its obsession with secrecy. No doubt this started with the entirely appropriate goal of <em>operational</em> secrecy: you don’t make it easy for the enemy to find and sink your troopships. But secrecy is contagious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you decide that something is so dangerous that the entire world
hinges on keeping it under control, this sense of fear and dread
starts to creep outwards. The worry about what must be controlled
becomes insatiable—and pretty soon the mundane is included with
the existential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so <a href=\"http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/2012/08/29/forbidden-spheres/\">all round objects become classified</a>. (quote is from linked article) This culture of secrecy is especially obvious where nuclear bombs are concerned, but it pervades every part of the complex, even to the groups and organizations that aren’t doing anything that’s formally secret. The default action is not to talk, and the default policy is to lock up the files. Publishing one’s research is an unusual action that must be justified and approved. Going on public record about an agency’s plans and activities is positively aberrant. I think this is why the US government collectively, quite a few officials personally, an awful lot of reporters in <a href=\"http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/yearning-to-be-subjects-journalist.html\">the “establishment” news media</a>,  and <a href=\"http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2013/06/one-of-things-i-find-most-fascinating.html\">a truly depressing number of private citizens</a>, have been acting as if <em>reporting that spying is going on</em> is far, far worse than the spying itself. In the mind of someone invested in secrecy culture, leaking a secret is worse than anything. It <em>isn’t done</em>.  And what with the military-industrial complex being the single largest employer in the country, and its attitudes trickling down to state and local government as well, it wouldn’t surprise me if nearly every citizen has had <em>some</em> contact with secrecy culture.</p>
<p>This hit me personally last weekend. I was at my grandmother’s 90th birthday party and one of my relatives wanted to know what I thought of the news. The conversation went around in circles for a while because we were both agreeing with each other that we were disgusted that such a thing could happen, but it turned out that <em>I</em> was disgusted by the spying and <em>he</em> was disgusted by the government’s failure to keep the spying secret.  Once this became clear, I said to him that I didn’t think the spying should have been secret in the first place, and that made so little sense to him that it ended the conversation.</p>
<h3>Kerckhoffs’ Principle</h3>
<p>The thing is, too much secrecy turns out to be self-defeating. This is well-understood in cryptography; it is the famous principle proposed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Kerckhoffs\">Auguste Kerckhoffs</a> in 1883:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The system [that is, the algorithm for encrypting messages] must not
be required to be secret. It must be able to fall into the hands of
the enemy without  inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is counterintuitive. Why <em>wouldn’t</em> you conceal your encryption algorithm from the enemy? Indeed, even though Kerckhoffs wrote in 1883, up till about 1977 everyone did just that, believing that it couldn’t <em>hurt</em>. And some people, not to mention some major industrial standards organizations who ought to know better, still do. Unfortunately, it turns out that it <em>does</em> hurt.  Cryptographic algorithms are difficult to design, and unforgiving of errors.  A design that hasn’t been vetted by lots of people is almost surely flawed.  If you publish an algorithm and invite feedback, you attract attention from many more cryptographers than you could hope to employ internally, and they’ll tell you when they find a problem.  Meantime, <em>whether or not</em> you publish an algorithm, the odds are that the enemy will find out how it works.  But when <em>they</em> find a flaw, they won’t tell you about it; they’ll just <em>use</em> it to read your messages. If you’re very lucky, before this happens, someone relatively well-disposed to you will discover your secret algorithm, find the flaws, and <a href=\"http://www.owlfolio.org/research/the-conference-formerly-known-as-oakland-day-1/#dont-trust-satellite-phones\">tell you about it in a highly public and embarrassing manner</a>.</p>
<p>But Kerckhoffs’ Principle is not just for cryptographic primitives.  It applies to network protocol design, which is very nearly as unforgiving, and not as codified: nowadays security analysts are far more likely to find a mistake in the way a protocol <em>uses</em> a cipher than to break the cipher itself.  It also applies to software in general: there’s a <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceschneier/2012/05/30/the-vulnerabilities-market-and-the-future-of-security/\">black market for “zero-day exploits”</a> (that is, not-yet-fixed security-critical bugs) in both open- and closed-source software, but open-source software attracts more attention from people who would rather see the bugs fixed, because open source (as a social phenomenon) is more inviting of experimentation and feedback.</p>
<p>We can generalize even further, past computer ’ware to other complex systems: such as nation-states and their governments.  The logic of Kerckhoff’s principle predicts that when a political decision <em>isn’t</em> made in public with full knowledge of the situation, it will be more likely to be a bad decision, specifically a decision which can be exploited.  Yet that is precisely the sort of decision making that secrecy culture demands.
If the NSA’s blanket surveillance programs had been public knowledge from the get-go, we could have <a href=\"https://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/06/13/3-questions-about-nsa-surveillance/\">asked pointed questions</a>, starting with “Is this worth the sacrifice of civil liberties?” but also including things like “Does this actually <em>work</em> against criminals who know their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradecraft\">tradecraft</a>?” and “You want <em>how much</em> money?” and of course “That wouldn’t happen to be your father’s brother’s nephew’s cousin’s former roommate’s defense contracting firm you’re proposing to hire, would it now?”</p>
<p>But they weren’t, and we didn’t, and oddly enough, it seems that we have spent <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_12744661\">billions of dollars</a> on a system which <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-23/u-s-surveillance-is-not-aimed-at-terrorists.html\"><em>doesn’t</em> work against competent criminals</a> but which invites <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/06/26/195045/memories-of-stasi-color-germans.html\">unflattering comparisons with the Stasi</a>.  Worse yet, the NSA’s surveillance programs look suspiciously like <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2013/06/07/u-s-never-really-ended-creepy-total-information-awareness-program/\">a continuation of the “Total Information Awareness” program that Congress axed in 2003</a>, which means the secrecy culture is prepared to <em>ignore</em> decisions by its elected overseers that don’t go its way, or twist arms behind the scenes till the decision is—secretly, of course—reversed.  At that point, can we call this a democracy anymore?</p>" nil nil "df036404e82b7c71398b4aecff668b4e") (253 (20949 15560 826118) "http://blog.mozilla.org/planet/2013/06/30/planet-additions-class-of-6302013/" "Planet Mozilla Blog: Planet Additions: Class Of 6/30/2013" "raccettura" "Sun, 30 Jun 2013 18:35:52 +0000" "<p><a href=\"http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/\">Michael Coates</a> (<a href=\"http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss\">feed</a>) – I currently have a <a href=\"http://michael-coates.blogspot.com/\">security blog</a> that is listed on planet based on my Mozilla tag.

<p>Of all the trips I’ve taken this year, I think the Mozilla Summit Planning Assembly was the one I looked forward to most – a chance to help shape the future of Mozilla and have great conversations with people who are passionate about the same things I am! I also admit I was really worried that we were too big of a group to get anything done. Turns out I was not alone. We all showed up ready to set the content and agenda for the Mozilla Summit.</p>
<p><strong>A day of tough discussions and building trust</strong></p>
<p>We had some excellent conversations Friday night and Saturday. We did a number of different exercises designed to start conversations and pull out key themes. For example, we started out  Saturday with an “unpanel”. Four people sit in the middle of the group. They have a conversation. There’s an empty chair as well and whenever someone in the audience wants to join the conversation, they slide into the empty seat and one of the four sitting there self selects to go back to the bigger circle leaving an empty chair as an invitation for the next person. While at first it didn’t seem very different than a big group conversation where you passed around the mic, it turned out to be a great way to keep the audience engaged in the conversation. Every one was listening hard. The topics we covered were varied but a lot of it centered around non paid staff vs paid staff relationships – culture and responsibilities. We also talked about things like whether there’d be technical roadmap decisions made at the Summit, how people like to communicate, etc. One of the key takeaways for many of us was that we were all worried about similar issues!</p>
<p>Over the course of the day, <strong>two themes arose</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><strong>Old timers and new hires are having a hard time trusting each other at Mozilla.</strong> I’m sure I didn’t get all the nuances but it felt to me like old timers think new hires might not have the “Mozilla DNA” and might not have an appreciation for our mission and open source methods. And new hires think old timers are stuck and so concerned with consensus they aren’t always getting things done.  Over the weekend, I think we made great progress in killing that stereotype and building good relationships that bridge the gap. (<a href=\"http://lukasblakk.com/my-big-shift/\">Lukas Blakk wrote</a> about this experience as well.) I have to admit that personally I’m not sure where I fell on this stereotype other than feeling rather annoyed at both groups and some how personally responsible for both stereotypes. As a hiring manager, I’ve hired many of those new people. As a long time open source community member, I feel like it’s my job to make sure the “open source” way is considered and well represented.  I also think that part of the problem is how members of each group introduce themselves and represent themselves to the world – more on that later.</span></li>
<li><strong>Mozillians like to get stuff done!</strong> By the end of the day, we were all extremely uncomfortable with all of the discussions, panels and world cafe exercises with no clear idea of how it was going to produce an agenda for the Summit. Luckily our leaders and the Unconference organizers heard all of our concerns and when we turned up the second day, we got to create a rough outline of an agenda and topics for the Summit!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Getting down to work</strong></p>
<p>On the second day we did a “World Cafe” exercise. We had about 7 rooms and 3 time slots and everyone wrote in the topic they wanted to cover in one of the slots. We then did some consolidation and managed to squeeze everything into the ~20 slots.</p>
<p>The idea was to cover themes or topics we thought should be covered at the Mozilla Summit. Each session was to identify Session Title, Goals and Outcomes, People for Followup and What has to happen between now and the Summit. They were all captured in etherpads.</p>
<p>All the sessions I went to had great conversation. It was rather tricky to focus on how that topic would be covered at the Summit instead of just discussing the topic. We tried to focus on how the conversation would best happen at the Summit: what type of presentation it would be, how much should be a proposal vs a discussion, if it was one presentation or a theme, etc. Some times the topic you signed up for was not the topic your group ended up proposing. I attended discussions on communication, diversity (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mozdino\">Dino</a> and <a href=\"http://lukasblakk.com/\">Lukas</a> have a great diagram for a starting conversation!) and helping companies that aren’t used to “open” work with effectively with us.</p>
<p>Then <a href=\"https://commonspace.wordpress.com/\">Mark</a>, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/debbiecohen\">Debbie</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\">Mitchell</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/krnasz\">Kate</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2013/06/20/what-is-was/\">Mardi</a> grouped all of the topics into themes – interestingly “People” had the most topics. Other themes included Strategy, Product, Process and Purpose.</p>
<p>So now we have themes for the Summit. And a lot of proposed topics.</p>
<p>I found it really valuable to spend this time as a group planning for a big event. When you are going to bring 2,000 people together (in groups of 600) I think it’s essential to spend some time uncovering what the real issues that we need to discuss are.</p>
<p><strong>My take aways:</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the bigger goal of planning the Summit, I took away a few more key things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s important to <strong>work together, preferably in person</strong>. We built a lot of trust over the weekend – trust that would have taken much more time to build during our regular day-to-day lives and over the internet. I hope we can take that experience and bring it to the Mozilla Summit.</li>
<li>Mentors. After a conversation with <a href=\"http://diary.braniecki.net/\">Gandalf</a>, I came away thinking part of the solution might be <strong>holding mentors more accountable</strong> and some how measuring their success over time. We also discussed short term mentorship projects too.</li>
<li>How you introduce your self matters. With a few exceptions, most of the <strong>volunteer Mozillians introduced themselves as being “a community member”</strong> or a “Rep”. Most of <strong>paid staff introduced themselves by their functional role</strong> or team, “Firefox for Android”. This is natural as while we all feel like part of the greater Mozilla community, paid staff has in general been hired to do a particular role. But I feel like it’s a big part of the disconnect.</li>
<li><strong>Lots of communication formats</strong> are needed. <a href=\"http://lawrencemandel.com/\">Lawrence Mandel</a> pointed out that not everyone does well speaking in front of large groups at conferences, so whatever format the Summit takes, it needs to enable lots of communication vehicles, meetings, parties, irc, etherpads, newsgroups, … a way for everyone to find enough of their comfort zone so that they can be comfortable enough to participate fully.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Mozilla Summit Planning Assembly was one of the trips I was most looking forward to attending this year and it lived up to my expectations! I’m very excited for the Summit now! (And for all the planning that still has to happen before then!)</p>

<a href=\"https://login.persona.org\">Persona</a> conversations. As part of an
<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/2013/Auth_Jam_Session\">Auth Jam session</a>, a few of us explored the idea of adding
non-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth\">OAuth</a>-based authentication mechanisms to
<a href=\"https://indieauth.com\">IndieAuth</a>.</p>
<p>While <a href=\"http://aaronparecki.com\">Aaron</a> and <a href=\"http://ozten.com\">Austin</a> got
<a href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth/commit/1e5581b2a91b4d455be1310f833026a8c343ec71\">SMS</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth/commit/2dd7d58e26b65af53ea0a3c8659e1779dcb7be41\">Persona</a> working as IndieAuth providers during one of the Sunday hack
sessions, I wanted to explore the idea of IndieAuth (an implementation of
<a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth\">RelMeAuth</a>) as a
<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona/Implementing_a_Persona_IdP\">Persona identity provider</a>.</p>
<h3>Using IndieAuth on any Persona-enabled site</h3>
<p>The goal of this effort was to allow Indie Web developers to use their
preferred email address with Persona and have IndieAuth authenticate them
using any supported IndieAuth provider (e.g. <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/implementing-sign-twitter\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://developer.github.com/guides/basics-of-authentication/\">Github</a>).</p>
<p>This work will help bridge the gap between these two projects and allow
IndieAuth developers to log into more website using their
<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/How_to_set_up_IndieAuth_on_your_own_domain\">hard-earned credentials</a>.</p>
<h3>User setup</h3>
<p>In order to take advantage of this, users have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Serve a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona/.well-known-browserid\">support document</a> on their <em>email</em> domain declaring
<code>indieauth.com</code> as the authority for their domain.</li>
<li>Include a <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me\"><code>rel=\"me\"</code></a> link for their preferred
email address on their <em>personal</em> domain.</li>
<li>Advertise their <em>personal</em> domain on their <em>email</em> domain via
<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-webfinger\">WebFinger</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, Aaron would use the following support document at
<code>https://parecki.com/.well-known/browserid</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{
\"authority\": \"indieauth.com\"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then he would ensure that there is a <code>rel=\"me\"</code> link on <code>aaronparecki.com</code>
pointing to his preferred email address, <code>aaron@parecki.com</code>:</p>
<pre><code><a href=\"mailto:aaron@parecki.com\" rel=\"me\">Email me</a>
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, because his <em>email</em> domain (<code>parecki.com</code>) is different from his
<em>personal</em> domain (<code>aaronparecki.com</code>), they would need to be linked
together via WebFinger. Thankfully, he found a clever way to do this with
<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/aaronpk/5846789\">a simple Apache rewrite rule and some static files</a>.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Aaron and I worked out the the details of how this will work and wrote a
<a href=\"https://github.com/fmarier/indieauth-personaidp-spec\">walkthrough</a> to illustrate it.</p>
<p>The gist of it is that Persona will ask IndieAuth to certify an email
address and IndieAuth will convert that email address to a personal domain
(using WebFinger) before authenticating the user with one of the IndieAuth
providers enabled on that domain.</p>" nil nil "cbe37fff75b24051a937fbe59a534eb2") (250 (20949 15560 820690) "http://informationisart.com/19" "=?utf-8?Q?Sta=C5=9B_Ma=C5=82olepszy=3A?= Frequently asked questions about L20n" nil "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 23:47:00 +0000" "<p>I'm typing this on a train from Poznań to Warsaw, on my way back from
a <a href=\"http://chemikpil.pl/meet-js-wracamy-w-poznaniu/#post-1744\">meet.js</a> event organized by <a href=\"http://chemikpil.pl/\">Michał Maćkowiak</a>.  It was a great pleasure
to attend the event and to have an opportunity to talk about <a href=\"http://l20n.org\">L20n</a> to Polish
developers.</p>
<p>Whenever I try to explain L20n to people, I first try to understand
what they already know about localization.  I found that it's useful to ask if
a developer has ever shipped a multilingual product, or if an end-user has ever
seen anything similar to the image below, where all but one word of the message
was truncated to fit the screen (there's a good chance they have).</p>
<p class=\"noindent\">
<img src=\"http://informationisart.com/images/responsive.jpg\" />
</p>
<p>Another great way to better know your audience is to listen to questions.  Good
questions are a sign that the audience was able to relate to the problem L20n
is trying to solve.  (To see why the solution is compelling, one has to first
acknowledge the problem.)</p>
<p>I was really happy with the the questions I got after my talk at meet.js.  They
were insightful and inspiring and each one brought something more to the
conversation.  Below I try to recap my answers to recurring and common themes.</p>
<h3>Only localizers know what they need</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Do you expect localizers to have programming experience?</em></p>
<p>No.  We're realistic.  We expect localizers to be experts in localization, not
programming. We're not imposing any complex syntax nor require to write macros
and dict-like data structures.  We do give localizers the freedom to get as
complex as they need, when they need it.  After all, only the localizers know
what is it that they need, and L20n doesn't make any assumptions about the
language it's used to localize into.  It's grammar-agnostic to the extreme.</p>
<p>Fortunately, more often than not there is no need to get any more complex than
the baseline.  When it comes to simple cases, L20n is pleasantly simple :</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><identifier</span> <span class=\"s\">\"A translated value\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
<span class=\"nv\"><multiline</span> <span class=\"s\">\"\"\"</span>
<span class=\"s\">      Multiline strings are easy to read and edit </span>
<span class=\"s\">      thanks to the triple-quote syntax.</span>
<span class=\"s\">    \"\"\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Localizing Mozilla projects has taught us that as many as 90-95% of messages
found in the UI are simple key-value pairs that won't require any advanced
knowledge of L20n's features.</p>
<p>For instance, the <a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/blob/master/tools/perf/example.lol\">file that we use to measure the performance</a> of real-life
usage of L20n, consists of over 500 strings, only 4 of which <em>are not key-value
pairs</em>.  The file is based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/v1.0.1/apps/settings/locales/settings.en-US.properties\">localization file</a> of Firefox OS's largest
app, Settings.</p>
<p>So why develop L20n at all?  Because it's the remaining 5% that make or break
the UI of your app.  They're too important to ignore and they are responsible
for the experience of the user.</p>
<p>L20n was created to cater to these 5%, and admittedly, L20n examples can get
rather complex (see <a href=\"http://l20n.github.io/tinker/\">L20n Tinker</a> for an example).  We're trying to show off
advanced features to explain what's possible with the framework and how it
handles common challenges of the UI design.</p>
<p>The vast majority of languages and use cases probably won't even need them.<br />
L20n's motto say it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep simple things simple.  Make complex things possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Common helpers for each language</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Will there be plural macros built into L20n for each language?</em></p>
<p>We may consider adding common rules for all languages at some point in the
future, but for the 1.0 release we decided to keep the framework lean and leave
them out.</p>
<p>Instead, we're hoping that more experienced localizers, preferably with some
programming knowledge, will step in and create common L20n files to be included
by others in their own projects.  Such files would include commonly-used
helpers like plural macros, translations of the names of the months and the
days of the week, formal and informal greetings depending on the time of day
<em>et cetera</em>.</p>
<p>Consider the following L20n file, <code>common.lol</code>:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">     <span class=\"nv\"><plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$n</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">$n</span> <span class=\"nb\">== </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"nv\">?</span> <span class=\"s\">\"zero\"</span> <span class=\"err\">:</span>
<span class=\"nv\">$n</span> <span class=\"nb\">== </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"nv\">?</span> <span class=\"s\">\"one\"</span> <span class=\"err\">:</span>
<span class=\"s\">\"many\"</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nb\">> </span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You could use the above plural macro in another file by using L20n's handy <code>import</code>
statement.</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\">import</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"ss\">'common.lol</span><span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>
<span class=\"nv\"><unread</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$unreadMessages</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">zero</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"No unread messages.  Good job!\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">one</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"You have one unread message.\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*many</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"You have {{ $unreadMessages }} unread messages.\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Thanks to this approach, the localizer keeps the control over even such basic
features of the localization as the plural selector, which allows for great
flexibility (if needed).</p>
<p>We'd love to see such common files created organically by the community and
shared among localizers in a decentralized manner.</p>
<h3>Context data and for-loops</h3>
<p>Question: <em>If the context data is global, how do I built multi-item UIs?</em></p>
<p>The interface between L20n's context and the data that developer wants to
expose to it indeed makes the data available context-wide.  In other words, if
the developer defines the context data as follows:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"json language-json\">    <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nt\">\"currentUser\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nt\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Jane\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
<span class=\"nt\">\"gender\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"feminine\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…it will be available to the localizer as <code>$currentUser</code> and can be used in any
entity.  This is an important design concept of L20n which goes back to the
idea that only the localizers can know what they need to properly localize
a message in the UI.  English may not require the user's gender to build
grammatically-correct sentences, but other languages certainly do.</p>
<p>To achieve the same in other localization frameworks, the developer would need
to pass the <code>currentUser</code> object in every call the the framework, just in case
the requested string makes use of that information in some language.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you want to build the UI out of repeating blocks and
exposing data needed by each block would lead to naming conflicts.  In such
cases, you can pass data on a per-entity basis as a second argument to
<a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/tree/1.0.0b3#ctxgetid-string-ctxdata-object\"><code>Context::get</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/tree/1.0.0b3#ctxgetentityid-string-ctxdata-object\"><code>Context::getEntity</code></a>.  Consider the following JavaScript
code:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">    <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">l10n</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'ready'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// ... </span>
<span class=\"nx\">notifications</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">forEach</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">notification</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nx\">nodes</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">].</span><span class=\"nx\">textContent</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">l10n</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">get</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'notification'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// pass notification.fromUser as $fromUser to the requested entity</span>
<span class=\"nx\">fromUser</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">notification</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">fromUser</span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// ... </span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how the developer only asks for the value of the <code>notification</code> entity
and passes <code>notification.fromUser</code> as <code>$fromUser</code>.  Here's what the
corresponding L20n code could look like:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><notification</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants to add you as a friend\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or assuming <code>$fromUser</code> has a <code>gender</code> property:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><notification</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">$fromUser.gender</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants you to add her to your friends\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants you to add him to your friends\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants you to add them to your friends\"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It's still possible, of course, to use the context-wide <code>$currentUser</code> variable
in the translation.  In the following example in Polish, the \"wants you
to add\" part needs to be accorded with the gender of the recipient, so it makes
use of both <code>$fromUser</code> passed to it directly and <code>$currentUser</code> available
context-wide.</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><notification</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">$fromUser.gender</span>, <span class=\"nv\">$currentUser.gender</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodała ją do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodał ją do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce zostać twoją znajomą\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodał go do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodał go do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce zostać twoim znajomym\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce dodać cię do znajomych\"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>See how this example can progressively get more complex?  It's interesting to
realize that the <code>unknown</code> case for both genders is, in fact, enough to get the
message across in a gramatically correct sentence.  Using more advanced featurs
of L20n, however, allows us to create a much more user-friendly interface which
seamlessly adapts to the user's gender.  As <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_and_Ray_Eames\">Charles Eames</a> famously put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The details are not the details. They make the design.</p>

<h3>L20n is declarative</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Can L20n automatically create declensions of unknown nouns?</em></p>
<p>It's tempting to try to create a framework that—with enough rules codified in
it—would be able to automatically decline nouns or conjugate verbs.  This has
sadly proven to be extremely difficult a task in practice which has been
keeping linguists and programmers busy for years.  Natural languages have too
many rules, too many exceptions and are not context-free.  </p>
<p>I could imagine tools built into L20n that would help create heuristics for
grammatical inflection.  For instance, we could add a method to check if a word
or an <em>n</em>-tuple starts or ends with a given string of characters.  This would
likely lead, however, to localizations becoming state machines, <em>imperatively</em>
trying to guess the correct inflection.  Unfortunately, state machines don't
model the intricacies of natural languages well.</p>
<p>L20n takes a <em>declarative</em> approach to localization, working around grammar
when needed.  Looking at examples of L20n code, it's important to remember that
they are not trying to codify the entire logic of the language's grammar, but
instead, they aim at declaring possible messages that the user might see in the
interface.</p>
<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/preso/blob/master/meetjs-poznan-2013/miasta.l20n\">one of the examples</a> I demoed during my talk at meet.js, I built a local
entity to store declensions of common city names.  The entity only defined
a nominative and a locative as these were the only cases that mattered in the
use case.  Furthermore, even though the locative case in Polish works with such
prepositions as <em>in</em>, <em>inside</em>, <em>on</em>, <em>ontop</em> and <em>about</em>, the example only
made use of <em>in</em>.  I ended up declaring my own case which I dubbed
<em>locativeIn</em>, which included the preposition.  This allowed me to easily handle
exceptions where the Polish word for <em>in</em> changes slightly to make the whole
expression sound better (<em>w Warszawie</em>—in Warsaw, but <em>we Wrocławiu</em>—in
Wrocław).</p>
<h3>Redundant by design</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Do I need to repeat the entire sentence just to change one
preposition?</em></p>
<p>The last example that I showed was a tiny website that I created during one
coffee break that counted down days and hours to my vacation.  The <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/stasm/5893026\">L20n
resource file</a> for this example is just one macro and one string, and yet
it's 34 lines long.  We designed L20n to be like this on purpose.</p>
<p>The goal was the encourage some repetition and redundancy in the syntax in
order to allow for more customization.  All for the sake of being able to
create better UI.</p>
<p>ICU's <a href=\"http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/text/MessageFormat.html\">MessageFormat</a> and its <a href=\"https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js\">JavaScript implementation</a> handle redundancy
by allowing branching locally inside of localizable strings.  While this is
technically possible (or almost possible) in L20n by using local entities,
I actually think that some redundancy can be healthy and can help improve the
readability of L20n code.</p>

<p>Dear Entrepreneur,</p>
<p>We need you. We – that is the world. Yes, you read that right. The world needs you.</p>
<p>Let me explain: Spain's youth unemployment rate is now close to 60%. Sixty percent. That is more than every second person under the age of 30 being unemployed. Italy's youth unemployment rate recently smashed through the 40% mark. The same is true for many other countries all around the globe. We have more than 7 billion people inhabiting this planet with an annual growth rate of 1.3%. That means we double the population every 50 years. A friend recently told me that we need 600 million sustainable jobs by 2020.</p>
<p>I fundamentally believe that the only way to get there is through entrepreneurship. We need people like you who are building companies, solving some of the most pressing problems in the world and create jobs doing so.</p>
<p>These are pretty scary and incredibly exciting times. While there is revolutions and uprisings looming, we will also witness the world's online population double in the next 5-10 or so years. Imagine what it will mean for the planet to have 2 billion more people with access to the web, Wikipedia and the global marketplace.</p>
<p>With that being said – we have our work cut out for us. Now is the time. Let's get cranking.</p>" nil nil "64cc9000be29e730affdfd52b7bced0f") (248 (20949 15560 815944) "http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1615" "David Humphrey: Reading =?utf-8?B?4oCcV29yZHPigJ0=?=" "david.humphrey" "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 13:47:40 +0000" "<p>You’ve no doubt seen Justin Jackson’s excellent web site, <a href=\"http://justinjackson.ca/words.html\">Words</a>.  I loved it before I was half-way finished reading the whole way through.  The idea is powerful.  Words are powerful.  The web is powerful.</p>
<p>A few days later I saw Roman Schmitz riffing on the same idea with <a href=\"http://slopjong.de/words.txt\">words.txt</a>.  Roman ends with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Start with some initial words and continue with your fancy designs, responsive layouts, and scripts that do magical things.</p></blockquote>
<p>I loved this too.  There’s some excellent ideas in both pages, which I encourage you to read and ponder.</p>
<p>I want to say something about how these pages are constructed.  Earlier this year I had an interesting chat with David Ascher about what a modern web page is, and what it means to make something for the web.  We were doing planning work for Webmaker, and trying to think about what a person in 2013 needs to know and do in order to make something on the web.  David made the point that the web is no longer just HTML, CSS, and JS, but also metadata, analytics, APIs, and a host of other connective tissue beneath a skin of browser content.</p>
<p>Words and words.txt provide an interesting opportunity to explore this idea.  What is a web page in 2013, one that is intentionally stripped down, aware of itself, and trying to be nothing more than words?</p>
<p>We can’t do a pure diff of Words and words.txt, since the content isn’t identical, but if we did we see that Words is made of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>words</li>
<li>a doctype</li>
<li>a handful of HTML elements, including <code>html, head, meta, title, body, div, h1, p, strong, em, a</code></li>
<li>a few HTML entities for quotes</li>
<li>a dozen or so URLs</li>
<li>a tiny amount of CSS styling</li>
<li>a small script block with JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>What I find interesting is how Words situates itself within the web.  Because there is so little that isn’t words, it’s useful to consider what is there.</p>
<p>For one, there are links to two different social networks, Twitter and Google+.  It’s also interesting to look at that script.  This script, the so called <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/asyncTracking\">GA or Google Analytics script</a>, is so ubiquitous on the web, it’s almost not worth mentioning, and Justin doesn’t mention it.  I don’t say that because I attribute nefarious intentions to him; quite the opposite, I point it out because it’s so common now that you probably won’t visit many pages today that don’t also have it.  It’s simply become a de facto standard for making web pages.  Whether that’s good or bad is another discussion separate from the fact that it’s reality.</p>
<p>The web isn’t just HTML, CSS, and JS anymore.  The difference between Words and words.txt is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and <em>analytics</em>.  We don’t just write words on the web in 2013–we style them, lay them out, link them to other sites, and then <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115056462967470089501/posts/Ck215SzLx7Y\">watch and count people as they read them</a>.</p>
<p>In 2013, the web is words with awareness, words with analytics.</p>" nil nil "6c9b036806aafaea21812c05eb30e5dd") (247 (20949 15560 814545) "http://christianheilmann.com/2013/06/29/in-praise-of-intelligent-paper-maps-map%c2%b2-on-kickstarter/" "Christian Heilmann: In praise of intelligent paper maps =?utf-8?B?4oCTIG1hcMKy?= on Kickstarter" "Chris Heilmann" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 23:52:58 +0000" "<p>I am currently in Barcelona, a gorgeous but quite confusing town.

<h3>Investigating SQLite Performance via Telemetry</h3>
<p>Years ago I tweaked our SQLite clients to use a larger page size. In my testing this seemed to achieve a speedup of 0.2-2x, see <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=416330\" title=\"Suboptimal SQLite page size\">bug 416330</a>. Unfortunately, ~30% of our users are still on the old page size (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=634374\" title=\"Fix page_size of WAL databases\">bug 634374</a>). We used a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/jydoop\">jydoop</a> query to figure out if it’s worth developing a feature to convert these users over using two different (time spent <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/jydoop/blob/master/scripts/places4k.py\">reading</a> & time spent <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/jydoop/blob/master/scripts/places4k-slowsql.py\">executing</a> a query) ways to measure performance differences. According to both methods there is a 4x reduction in sqlite IO waits with the larger page size, so we’ll be adding code to convert people over more aggressively.</p>
<p>This was a cool investigation because it highlighted how much more confidence we have when making performance decisions now (due to telemetry) vs a few years ago.</p>" nil nil "4e06308a5af8a6c9f9352ecb25901037") (243 (20949 15560 812513) "http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1610" "David Humphrey: Webmaker.org after 9 weeks, in 9 weeks" "david.humphrey" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 20:23:56 +0000" "<p>This week I spent a few days meeting with the Mozilla Foundation’s Webmaker engineering and design team in the Toronto office.  It was a great time of reflection after the <a href=\"http://www.cassiemcdaniel.com/blog/the-future-of-webmaking/\">past 9 weeks</a>, and a time to plan the next 9 weeks.  I left feeling like we’re on track, and excited about what’s next, and wanted to share some of my observations.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7321/9162209906_d5de301614.jpg\" title=\"Webmaker planning meeting at MoTo\" width=\"500\" /></p>
<p>For various reasons, our planning horizon has been, and continues to occupy a 9 week period.  Trying to forecast software projects beyond two months is fraught.  The team has really come together around a period of time that honours proper design-first development, and one that also gives engineers space to follow a rigorous process of review, iteration, and deployment (dev, staging, production).  Combining this with our ability to ship to users in short order (everyone on the team can ship, we have proper staging environments, push-button automated deploys, etc), I think the coming 9 weeks are going to be awesome in the way they let us move more quickly.</p>
<p>In order to launch the first iteration of the new <a href=\"https://webmaker.org\">webmaker.org</a>, we had to bring up 5 new apps all at once, with various dependencies between each.  This was hard to do in stages, and so we had to do a “1.0″ style release that happened all on one day.  Over the summer, this won’t be necessary, since we can now iterate on our platform, apps, and content in parallel.  Even weekly trains, as we did with Popcorn Maker in the early winter, feels too slow now, and we’ll be shipping multiple times a day going forward.</p>
<p>So what will we be shipping?  In the next 9 weeks, our goal is <strong>follow-through</strong>.  We shipped an MVP with the new webmaker.org, and we had, and have, many plans that go much further than what’s there now.  We’re ready to dive into some of these now.  At a high-level, this includes working toward shipping the following in the coming months:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webmaker Localization (l10n)</strong>:  I’ve <a href=\"http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1605\">already written about this</a>, and we remain bullish on localizing webmaker.org by the end of the summer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Ray Goggles:</strong> everyone who has ever used it loves this tool, and we do too.  <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875991\">Making it work in the new webmaker.org</a> is a high priority for us.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open MakeAPI to 3rd Party Users</strong>: we think the MakeAPI, with its idea of cataloging and making discoverable the things one makes, is useful beyond just working with our own tools.  We’ve already heard from 3rd party apps that want to use it, and we’re going to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=888285\">update it so this is possible</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on Mobile Experience:</strong> having webmaker.org work in mobile and be more responsive, is something we’re excited to do.  We’ve already started in this direction, and plan to make it better and better as the summer unfolds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Webmaker Mobile Web App:</strong> we also want to try our hand at creating a new Webmaker tool specifically for mobile, and geared to allowing users to publish to the MakeAPI more seamlessly.  This is at the early design phase, so I won’t anticipate direction by saying more.  What I can say is that we’re planning to leverage the open web platform (hi there, Firefox OS!).  I know Cassie, Kate, and others will have more to say on it soon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improve makes.org:</strong> the user publishing makes.org domain is one of our most loved features in the new site, and we have plans to take it further, adding things like user profile pages, better page and URL naming, analytics, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Media Sync</strong>: making on the web means using a variety of services, tools, and publishing platforms.  Users of the web know that one doesn’t use just a single site or work only using one account or identity.  With webmaker.org, we want to make it possible to more easily access and use the disparate bits one has created across the web.  We’d like to allow users to access their work on YouTube, Flickr, SoundCloud, etc., and use it to make and remix new work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI and UX Improvements in our Tools:</strong> we have lots of ideas to improve how our existing tools work, make them more fun and easier to use.  Some of these are small and others will take many weeks.  Watch for things to evolve.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scripts in Thimble:</strong> we’ve been working hard toward allowing our users to safely include JavaScript in their published makes for some time.  Doing this properly has meant a bunch of engineering work in our publishing code, and we’re still putting the final touches on it.  But we’re really close, and I know Pomax is currently getting the final pieces in place.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content, Content, Content:</strong> the new webmaker.org is built around content and enabling newer and better content types is something we’re already working to do.  Additionally, we have UI changes that we need to ship to make this content easier to find and remix</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tutorials:</strong> our current solution for tutorials is really a first effort at an MVP.  There’s a lot more we can do, and figuring out how to do them well is on our list.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to some of these big ticket things, there’s a host of other work that will occupy us as we go forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying down technical- and design-debt</li>
<li>Creating a Style Guide for our UI and UX</li>
<li>Creating Documentation for ourselves and users</li>
<li>Doing more User Testing</li>
<li>Figuring out how to do proper QA and User Support</li>

I’m writing to make it easy for designers to link mockups to live bugs.  But I
didn’t mention that I had a reasonably-working version of the tool written in
<a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone</a> which I’ve decided to port to <a href=\"http://angularjs.org/\">Angular</a>.  The reasons why are largely beside the point of this
blog post, but I’ll try to sum them up by saying that I reached a point where
Backbone seemed to be confusing me more than helping me, and Angular got a
<em>lot</em> of good press at <a href=\"http://fluentconf.com/fluent2013\">FluentConf</a> this
year.</p>
<p>So this morning’s task in <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/commits/feature/angular\">the re-write</a> was to
re-hook up the <a href=\"https://login.persona.org/about\">Persona</a> integration.  I had
read recently that when you had a lot of dom-manipulation functions, you should
probably put that code in a directive, and since I hadn’t written an Angular
directive yet, I figured this would be a great time to learn how.  Writing <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/blob/feature/angular/views/index.html#L30\">the
html</a>
was pretty easy, of course, and most of the code from the existing
implementation (which was largely based on the code from the <a href=\"https://github.com/jbuck/express-persona/blob/master/README.md\">express-persona
readme</a>) could
be ported over fairly quickly.  The only tricky part I ran into was figuring
out that I needed to include <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/angular-tools/blob/master/persona.js#L36\"><code>restrict: 'E'</code></a> in the
<a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive#directivedefinitionobject\">Directive Definition Object</a>.  After I
was done, I noticed that there really wasn’t that much in the code that had
anything to do with the tool I’m writing, and thus I pulled it out into a
separate repo so that other people can use it.</p>
<p>And with that, I announce <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/angular-tools/\">Angular-Tools</a>, a repo containing one or more tools
which you might find useful if you build Angular apps.  As always, pull

"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 10:43:00 +0000" "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">We use Mercurial to manage the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla source tree</a>. Locally I use the Mercurial Queues (mq) extension to manage my patch queue. Mq keeps a stack of patches and provides commands (qnew, qpush, etc.) for applying, updating, and managing patches. The patches are kept in a 'patches' subdirectory in the project's .hg directory. Also in that directory are two files of meta-data - 'status' and 'series'. The former is binary data and keeps track of which patches are currently applied. The latter is text and contains an ordered list of your patches. By fiddling with the 'series' file you can manually add, remove, and re-order patches in a queue.<br /><br />I have several real and virtual machines with multiple copies of the tree on each (not always the same tree - moz-central vs inbound, for example). Keeping the patches in sync is a pain. I have to do this when testing on different platforms and when landing patches (moving from my dev tree to my clean clone of inbound). One solution is creating a user repo in the patch queue. You can then manage your queue as another repo. This is nice because you get history and can wind back mistakes, as well as backup and synchronisation. However, it is a bit cumbersome. I would prefer something more convenient for syncing between repos on the same and different machines. So, I thought what if I could use Dropbox to sync the patch queues? After all for keeping files in sync, Dropbox is as convenient as it gets. It turns out to be not that easy because Dropbox will not sync files outside of the Dropbox directory and hg will not allow you to use any directory other than '.hg/patches' for your patch queue. Furthermore you can't just use a symlink because you really don't want to synchronise the 'status' file, only the patches (and Dropbox will not exclude files). (Sometimes I want to synchronise the 'series' file, and sometimes not).<br /><br />My solution is to patch the mq extension to allow specifying the path to patches and the meta-data files (yay for open source!). I can then set up symlinks from the subdirectories to my Dropbox directory and we're good to go. The path is to patches is fairly well hard coded into the extension, I couldn't find a way to refer to a completely different directory, which would mean not needing the symlinks. The syncing between repos is not quite real-time, it only happens when I qrefresh, but that's as good as it can get, really. I have to be a bit careful to keep the repos at similar ages so that the patches cleanly apply. Which patches are actually applied is also not synced, so I have to manually track that. And even if a patch is synced, it is not automatically re-applied to the tree. I have to do a manual qpop/qpush. Still, I think this is a real improvement on my workflow. It also means it is easy for people to see what I'm working on in almost real-time, which is pretty cool.<br /><br />If you use qqueue to manage multiple patch queues, this technique should work cleanly with that. Each queue will need a subdirectory for each named path you specify. Each can be symlinked to a different directory in Dropbox or wherever.<br /><br /><b>Instructions</b><br /><br />If you want to set up something like this yourself, you will need to:<br /><br />grab the mercurial source<br />grab my patches<br />apply them<br />build mercurial<br />set up symlinks<br />configure mq<br /><br />Start by cloning the <a href=\"http://selenic.com/hg\" target=\"_blank\">hg repo</a> (I guess we could use a source bundle, but we may as well get the bleeding edge). The easiest way to apply my patches is using a queue, so qinit in the new hg directory. Download and extract the <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74741329/hg/mq_paths.tar.bz2\" target=\"_blank\">patches and series file</a> and un-tar into the hg patches directory. hg qpush -a.<br /><br />Then we need to build mercurial. On Linux this was easy, I needed to install the python-dev package and then just run 'make local' in the hg directory (I'm not going to install the new hg as the default one in case something breaks). Then pop an alias to the new hg in your .bashrc.<br /><br />Building and installing in Windows was much more of a pain, I think in part because I have a load of different versions of Mercurial installed in different places. Also I work half in real windows and half in the moz-build flavour of MinGW. Anyway, the following worked. More information <a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WindowsInstall\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/BuildingOnWindows\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br /><br />After cloning the hg repo, I installed a fresh version of MinGW (I had Python, and I guess its headers). I had to explicitly add '/c/MinGW/bin' or whatever to my PATH (export PATH... in MinGW, not the system-wide Windows version). Then I ran 'python setup.py build --force -c mingw32' from the MinGW console (this failed from the windows command prompt, even after playing with the path environment variable). I then manually copied all the .pyd files from 'hg\\build\\lib.win32-2.7\\mercurial' to 'hg\\mercurial' (where 'hg' is where I cloned hg to). Then I created an alias to the new version of hg similarly to on Linux.<br /><br />Next the symlinks. Actually, it turns out you can't use symlinks (on Linux ), because hg throws a hissy fit because \"security\". But you can use mount - 'mount -o bind $target $link' where target is inside dropbox and link is inside .hg/patches. You can put the mount in your /etc/fstab to re-mount on startup.<br /><br />On Windows use 'mklink /J $link &target'. Note the order of link and target is reversed (compared to mount on Linux) and that you will have to use '\\' not '/'. This only works in the windows command propt, not the MinGW console.<br /><br />Finally you need to configure mq. You do this by editing the hgrc file in the projects '.hg' directory (I guess you could use your ~/.hgrc file (Mercurial.ini on Windows) if you want to use the same sub-paths for all your repos, but I didn't). Add an mq section, you can then set 'seriespath', 'statuspath', 'patchespath', and 'guardspath' to add a sub-path for the various kinds of files. Any kind you don't specify a path for gets put in the usual place (.hg/patches). For example,<br /><br />[mq]<br />seriespath = shared<br />patchespath = shared<br /><br />will result in your patches and series file ending up in '.hg/patches/shared' and your status file in '.hg/patches'. (This is what I do for most of my repos, for some I don't specify seriespath so I can do different things there).<br /><br />Note: sometimes on Windows (never Linux, which is why I haven't fixed this) I see an error message when doing 'hg qnew'. But the patch gets created just fine, so it seems to be fine to ignore this.<br /><br />Finally, if you would like to see what I am working on, you can find my patches <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74741329/ncameron.org/patches.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</div>" nil nil "1aa1ab45cce8c0e4561c3ef9fdb83a5b") (238 (20949 15560 768531) "http://michellethorne.cc/2013/06/making-a-difference-by-making-the-web/" "Michelle Thorne: Making a difference by making the web" "thornet" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 10:19:10 +0000" "<p>These days, with all the Prism/Tempura surveillance we’re learning about, <strong>one can feel quite powerless.</strong></p>
<p>For many it seems that there are just two responses: to either disengage with the web and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP7ebyqBn_M&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZP7ebyqBn_M\">go completely offline</a> or to shrug and say <a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/06/orwell-vs-kafka-against-nothing-to-hide/\">“I’ve got nothing to hide.”</a></p>
<p>While it’s only a very small piece of a larger effort, <strong>I’m proud to be working with people who care about a third way.</strong></p>
<h3>A Third Way: Teach the Web</h3>
<p>We believe in <strong>user empowerment that balances free expression online with a respect for user privacy.</strong></p>
<p>We want to help people take control of their digital lives—and <strong>foster a user-centric web.</strong> We can <a href=\"http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html\">rebuild the web we lost</a>.</p>
<p>To get there, we <strong>need to help people discover the joy of making things on the web.</strong> It’s important to show that the web is not a scary place. It is fun and useful to participate online while still controlling your data. This is a valuable lesson and one that should trump flashy apps or simple convenience.</p>
<p>I’d like to share some stories about <strong>people who volunteer to <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106022863174952221205\">teach the web</a>.</strong> Be it in their homes, their neighborhood shops, their city squares, or wherever, these are real stories about people who want to empower users of the web.</p>
<p><strong>It’s grassroots, it’s modest, but it’s a start.</strong></p>
<h3>Teach your family</h3>
<p><strong>Activism starts at home.</strong> You begin with the people you care about, the people closest you.</p>
<p>Like the <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Convince-Your-Parents-to-Let-You-Download-Firefox\">activists who install Firefox for their friends and families</a>, <strong>teaching the web at home doesn’t cost anything and is sustainable.</strong> You don’t have to worry about big budgets or outreach. Just help the people in your living room.</p>
<p>This is Unnati, a 14 year-old webmaker. Under the mentorship of <a href=\"http://trendsincomputer.blogspot.de/\">Gauthamraj</a>, she’s gone from learning about the web to teaching it. At home, she’s taught her mother and father how to make the web. And now this year, bolstered by her new confidence in teaching, she’s organizing a <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/events/55\">bigger event in her city</a>.</p>

<p>And there’s Brendan, who started a <a href=\"http://neenanjones.blogspot.de/2013/05/rocket-launch.html\">maker club with his kids</a>. Together they try out fun projects each week and use the web to blog about them. The web is a platform that helps the family find new things to make and to share them with the world.</p>

<h3>Teach your neighbors</h3>
<p><strong>Sometimes to make a difference, you want to go outside your home.</strong> Teaching your neighbors is a natural next step. It’s about giving back to your community and helping people near you.</p>
<p>That’s <a href=\"http://merajimran.blogspot.in/2013/06/maker-party-shopkeeper-venus-residence.html\">what Meraj did</a>. <strong>He visited a shopkeeper on the corner, and taught them how to hack.</strong> The shopkeeper <a href=\"https://merajimran.makes.org/thimble/this-is-a-make-made-by-shopkeeper-avenu\">made a new website</a> for his store, and his whole family left <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0uK-tQv2OA&feature=youtu.be\">feeling empowered and joyful</a> about the possibilities of the web.</p>

<p>Recently, the Greek government abruptly shut down the state broadcaster, ERT, as part of its ongoing austerity drive. To help <strong>keep the news on air,</strong> Nikos, Freddy and Pierros ran workshops to teach webmaking and Open News tools to professional and citizen journalists. <strong>Set up in a public square, they <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ertops\">taught fellow Greek citizens how to be the makers of their own news.</a></strong></p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2314\" height=\"782\" src=\"http://michellethorne.cc/wp-content/uploads/ertops-e1372411424696.jpg\" title=\"ertops\" width=\"550\" /></p>
<h3>Teach the teachers</h3>
<p>Once you’ve taught your family and your neighbors, the next step is to <strong><a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/05/webmaker-train-the-trainer/\">teach other people how to teach the web.</a></strong> This means helping others develop techniques and tools that they can use to teach their family and neighbors.</p>
<p>This step is harder, but ultimately very powerful. <strong>It can increase the impact of grassroots engagement by an order of magnitude.</strong></p>
<p>Lawrence and San James organized their <strong><a href=\"http://www.newslibre.com/news/webmaker-mentor-training-kampala/\">first “train the trainer” event in Kampala, Uganda.</a></strong> They wanted to host a multi-stop webmaking tour to local schools, and in order to teach all those students, they needed more mentors.</p>
<p>Using techniques from <a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/05/webmaker-train-the-trainer/\">our training in Athens</a>, Lawrence and San James successfully mentored 40 new teachers. Lawrence noted, “It didn’t feel like a training but like a collaborative exchange of knowledge and ideas on hacking the web.”</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2317\" height=\"359\" src=\"http://michellethorne.cc/wp-content/uploads/train-the-trainers-kampala-e1372412408842.jpg\" title=\"train the trainers kampala\" width=\"540\" /></p>
<p>To scale these efforts even more, we launched an online training/collaboration called <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/\">Teach the Web</a>. With nearly 6,000 participants, and despite <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/teachtheweb-so-you-want-to-run-a-cmooc/\">all the associated challenges of coordinating and mentoring so many people</a>, it was incredibly rewarding to find so many kindred spirits who care about making the web.</p>
<p>These are stories from the participants in this course. <strong>And there are many more.</strong></p>
<h3>The Web is made by people</h3>
<p>As the first iteration of the #teachtheweb course comes to a close this week, we’re asking ourselves: <strong>what next?</strong></p>
<p>There are a several promising opportunities. Several mentors are <strong><a href=\"https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/articulos-weblitstd/\">localizing the course</a></strong> and will run the it again in different languages, including Spanish, French and hopefully others.</p>
<p>We’d also <strong>like to repeat the course,</strong> rolling in <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/teachtheweb-so-you-want-to-run-a-cmooc/\">what we learned this time around</a>. Likely, the course will be shorter (3 weeks instead of 9) and perhaps involve more tools than just webmaker ones.</p>
<p>I’d also love to see <strong>more resources on how to teach privacy.</strong> I whipped up a <a href=\"https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/lh00/\">prototype to teach encryption</a>, using material from the EFF. But there’s a lot more we can do to make these topics approachable, fun and easy to learn.</p>
<p>As we look to what else we can do, how we can promote a third way of online participation, I’m reminded of a story <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/113905697837976594807/posts\">Jeannie</a> told. She was helping a young learner make his first website. After publishing on the web, something clicked for him. <strong>He said, “Wow, so if I can make and share something on the web, does that mean that everything on the web is made by people?”</strong></p>
<p>Yes, yes it is. And we can do our part to help more people not be intimated or indifferent about the web, but <strong>instead to make things together and celebrate our shared, connected humanity.</strong></p>

<p>Today we are excited to announce a visual evolution of our Firefox brand that will better fit its extended usage beyond that of a desktop web browser. An overview of our brand history and the reasons for this evolution are <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/creative/?p=138\">covered on our Creative blog</a>, so this article will have a brief look at the previous version and then dive into the various visual changes we’ve made with the new design.</p>
<h3>What was new is now old</h3>
<p>The 2009-2013 Firefox logo is an amazing piece of artwork. That launch visual evolution focused on creating a refined visual element that spoke to the power and newness of the browser – a beautiful asset for a beautiful product. I use that logo every day in my work, and thanks to the Mozilla brand guide and assets repository, more and more people are using it as well. </p>
<p>Through my work and interacting with others who used it in video, print and web, it has become clear that though beautiful, the artwork does come with a few usage concerns like SVG compatibility and color consistency. We’ve listened to feedback over the years and documented these examples. Now, with the desire to reshape the look to reflect our brand evolution, this is the perfect time to step back and solve these issues.</p>
<div class=\"large-image-1129\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"657\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-4.png\" width=\"992\" /></div>
<h3>Make the logo simpler</h3>
<div class=\"large-side-1129\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-2.png\" width=\"300\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-3.png\" width=\"300\" />
<div class=\"callout-1129\">Simplifying a style doesn’t always mean bringing it down to basic geometric shapes and solid colors.</div>
</div>
<p>Simplifying a style doesn’t always mean bringing it down to basic geometric shapes and solid colors. You can in fact bring simplicity to a visual by better balancing color, contrast, shape, and detail. To that last point, we removed quite a bit of detail in this latest revision but purposely added more detail where needed to accommodate today’s high resolution screens. The simplification process not only focused on the look but also the structure by making it SVG compatible and more accessible for the broader Mozilla community.</p>
<p>The first step in the rebuild was to go in and strip out all the detail that was using blend mode layering such as multiply, screen and overlay – mostly found in the tail area <span class=\"point-1129\">1</span>. As stated, a key goal of the redesign was to make it work flawlessly in SVG as well as open up the possibility to rebuild all the internal structure using SVG and CSS gradients. Having reduced the logo down to its shape-tweaked forms <span class=\"point-1129\">2</span> and softer gradients, we continued to remove any detail we thought wasn’t critical to the overall image. This tied into another goal of having the image hold up with greater clarity at smaller sizes.</p>
<p>Once we had removed a fair amount of detail in the logo, it was time to look at introducing enhanced detail where it would be needed when scaled to larger sizes. Stephen Horlander recreated all the continents <span class=\"point-1129\">3</span> on the globe with high resolution displays in mind and we paired those with a removal of the high gloss <span class=\"point-1129\">4</span> to create a softer, deeper color globe. Combining these deeper blues with now lighter oranges in softer detailed fur <span class=\"point-1129\">5</span>, we achieved that greater contrast that would create better separation of the elements at all sizes.</p>
<p>A final touch that you may notice in the new logo (and one that makes me very happy) is the arm of the fox now extends from a shoulder instead of layering behind his chest <span class=\"point-1129\">6</span>. It’s a small detail, but it really seems to unify the form of the fox and make him feel more cohesive a brand element.</p>
<p>So there it is. Not a logo redesign, but a simplification in form and function. We hope you are as excited about the new look as we are about using it! Enjoy!</p>" nil nil "cc152d7232e938cc3475c5a527c1eb29") (234 (20949 15560 764147) "http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/2013/06/fighting-good-fight-direction-for.html" "Michael Coates: Fighting the Good Fight =?utf-8?Q?=E2=80=93?= A Direction for Mozilla to Lead the Open Web" "Michael Coates" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 16:38:00 +0000" "<div class=\"MsoNormal\">Mozilla found its way over ten years ago when       we saw the web       spiraling into peril. The web was stagnating, it was controlled,       and users had       no choice or voice in the future of the web. Here began Firefox, a       collective       effort where individuals around the world could contribute and       build the web       that they wanted to see. Fast-forward and we now see a healthy web       where       competition in browsing options spurs advancement and growth. </div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">But the web is transforming again. The battle       is not for       what browser you chose to use at your desk, but the entire       ecosystem that       powers the computer in your pocket. Not unlike the monopoly we saw       years ago       that stifled the web, we are now watching a distinct divide being       built in       mobile. This divide isolates users and forces them to choose which       part of the       web they want to live in. Developers can no longer just build for       the web;       instead they must build for each device a user brings to the web,       undermining       the very unity that made the web successful.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">Today Mozilla fights for mobile. To liberate       users from       closed ecosystems and enable developers to build for the web in       whatever shape       it is accessed – be that from desktop or mobile devices. We are       bringing       technologies that have powered the web into the foundation of a       mobile operating       system. This is combined with a design that enables developers to       use the       technologies they know and that have powered the web to easily       build powerful       mobile apps. We see a future of the web where mobile is not       different from the       web, only a different size serving different needs of the user. In       the end, the       technologies that power the web should be harnessed to also power       the web       experienced on mobile.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">But while we focus on the battleground of today       we must also       look forward to see what is next. The future always seems distant       until it is       right upon you. Mozilla must continue to be competitive so that we       can fight       for the users and be a driving force in the open web. We must look       past the fog       of today’s concerns to prepare for how to guide and shape the web       in the next       major phase. We’ve seen the web transform from something accessed       purely by a       desktop device to a mobile web that you carry with you in your       pocket. In       mobile, the web is where wherever the user goes, provided they       have their       device. But just as mobile has grown it too will one day yield to       the next       major shift of the web. I believe that shift will be to a user       centric web.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">A user centric web does not care what device       you use to       access the web. Desktop computer, mobile phone, tablet, TV screen,       car console,       wearable device and more - the web will be synonymous with the       user and the web       will follow the user wherever they go. Users will be less       concerned about       static web sites and apps, but more about their world, the way the       web       integrates into their daily lives and activities and every device       that the user       interacts with. To prepare for the next phase of the web Mozilla       must invest in       technologies that bring the web to the user regardless of their       device. The       center of the web will be the user.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">This requires a focus on identity, cloud, and       broadening the       reach of our platform. A user must be in control of their identity       on the web       with the ability to easily and seamless represent their identity       wherever they       may be. A user may have several devices they use often, but the       web will be       expected to function equally wherever they may be. To achieve this       Mozilla must       invest in cloud and creating a representation of a user, their       profile, their       identity and desires that is not tied to a particular device, but       rather to the       user directly. We also must continue to expand the platform to       other closed       ecosystems. Many companies will want to harness the web to attract       users, but a       closed ecosystem is an ecosystem that does not empower users and       rarely       represents the user’s desires and voice.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">The future is murky and can easily pivot at any       moment. The       choices of today’s technologies, many of which are heavily       debated, can greatly       influence what comes next. But if Mozilla is truly a leader of the       open web       then we must look past the obstacles of today and envision what       will come tomorrow.       Instead of waiting to liberate users from the next stranglehold,       let’s build       the foundation for the next phase of the open web. A web that       represents the       user, enables developers, and supports advancement in       technologies. </div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">Mozilla was built on the power of a massive       worldwide       community that fought the good fight for no other reason than it       was the right       thing to do. Let’s look forward and prepare to lead what comes       next for the       web.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>mcoates</span></div><span>    </span><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>mozillian </span></div>" nil nil "65dc178b525bfb6dad932f79abc6b79b") (233 (20949 15560 762845) "http://xulforge.com/blog/2013/06/android-in-4-easy-steps/" "Jorge Villalobos: Make your add-on support Android in 4 easy steps" "jorge" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 14:25:50 +0000" "<p>As you may know by now, we’re running an add-on developer contest called <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/amp-your-firefox/\"><strong>Amp Your Firefox</strong></a>. We’re very excited about it and there are various categories you can compete in, but we <em>especially</em> care about the mobile categories. We want to grow our collection of <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/android/\">add-ons for Android</a>, so that Android users can enjoy the fully customizable experience that is Firefox.</p>
<p>I have been working on making many of my add-ons Android-compatible (alas, I don’t qualify for the contest, being both an employee and a judge!). So I wanted to give you a quick primer on how easy it is to convert add-ons or create new ones that work for Android, from the perspective of someone who has already worked on desktop add-ons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Add Android compatibility to your manifest.</strong> That means supporting <code><em:id>{aa3c5121-dab2-40e2-81ca-7ea25febc110}</em:id></code> in your target applications, and adding <code><em:bootstrap>true</em:bootstrap></code> to make it restartless.</li>
<li><strong>Set up your <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions\">bootstrap.js</a> script.</strong> This replaces a good chunk of your overlay. This script is responsible for setting up and then clearing any UI elements that you want to add, and running any startup scripts. The <code>chrome.manifest</code> file is loaded normally, so any additional XUL, locale files and CSS are also loaded. Keep in mind that add-on UI on Android is pretty much limited to the content area, but you can still load XUL pages using <code>chrome</code> or <code>about</code> URLs. XPCOM and JS Modules are pretty much the same.</li>
<li><strong>Set up your bootstrap.js script, like, for real.</strong> It’s likely you want your add-on to work both for Android and desktop, so your bootstrap script should handle multiple windows well and clean up after itself. <a href=\"http://www.oxymoronical.com\">Mossop</a> wrote a <a href=\"http://www.oxymoronical.com/blog/2011/01/Playing-with-windows-in-restartless-bootstrapped-extensions\">great post with sample code</a> you can reuse to make sure you’ve covered your bases during install, uninstall, and windows opening and closing.</li>
<li><strong>Read the docs!</strong> Should this be the first step? … maybe, what do I know. You can find everything you need here: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile\">Extensions for Android</a>. You’ll especially want to get acquainted with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile/API/NativeWindow\"><code>NativeWindow</code></a> object, for Android-specific UI, and the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile/API/BrowserApp\"><code>BrowserApp</code></a> object, which is sort of the replacement of the <code>gBrowser</code> object / <code><tabbrowser></code> element.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was surprised at how easy it was to create add-ons that work on Android, and to port some of the ones I had already created. Userscript-type add-ons work very well because they generally don’t need UI outside of the content, so porting my <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/AMO-Admin-Assistant\">AMO Admin Assistant</a> add-on was pretty much trivial. More UI-heavy add-ons like <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/Remote-XUL-Manager\">Remote XUL Manager</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/CTP-Manager\">Click-to-Play Manager</a> required more thought. They both open a XUL window, which I ended up converting into an <code>about</code> page in the mobile version. I also created the <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/Mobile-Installer\">Mobile Installer</a> add-on exclusively for Android, which is more of a sample add-on I made for a talk, but uses more of the Android-specific APIs in <code>NativeWindow</code>. It’s also a nice little tool that makes it easier to install XPIs after you’ve copied them to your device.</p>
<p>All of the add-on links above point to Github, in case you’re interested in looking at their code and using some of it on your own add-ons. I hope this motivates you to give Android add-ons a try, and step up to the challenge in Amp Your Firefox. All you need is to submit your entry and have your add-on approved on AMO to win an awesome t-shirt, so I really don’t know what additional motivation is needed <img alt=\";)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://xulforge.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> .</p>

It was about people who care about the web and web literacy and working together to find ways to spread skills to learners. This post is a reflection on the meta structures and processes that created the experience. <strong>It's also only <em>mildly</em> reflective of the learning that occurred.</strong> <strong>These observations completely delude the very human and personal feelings I have towards the #teachtheweb community and all the individuals within it. </strong><em>[Update: Luckily, <a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/06/making-a-difference-by-making-the-web/\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle nails the human side of this story in her post.</a>]<strong>
</strong></em>
Although this post is going to sound a bit academic, a couple of my colleagues are going to be writing about the amazing stories and community members that made <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb</a> so incredibly awesome. And I'm sure I'll have more to say about my newly expanded <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Personal learning network\">personal learning network</a> and the KICK ASS MOZILLIANS who participated in #teachtheweb.
<h3>After #teachtheweb, I'm working under two assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are lurkers in this community.</strong> Lurkers are reading, looking, observing, maybe even making things, but they're not sharing in this community, or they're not sharing often.</li>
<li><strong>Activity fluctuates.</strong> Some people have time for #teachtheweb all at once or in spurts. Others take a certain amount of time each week. Some people dip in only on certain topics, others are fairly constant throughout.</li>
</ul>
[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<img alt=\"\" class=\" \" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ShZp9A2.png\" width=\"500\" /> Well, we didn't have at least one person from EVERY country, but...[/caption]
<h3>And three absolute certainties:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our metric overview is flawed.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter much because people are definitely learning together.</li>
<li><strong>#teachtheweb is an unmitigated success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Metrics and Multiple Channels</h3>
In the #teachtheweb experience, we have multiple channels where people can participate, so we have multiple channels to collect metrics from. Unfortunately, <strong>collecting accurate metrics is next to impossible</strong> for a couple of reasons:
<ol>
<li>We didn't get Analytics onto the <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb site</a> until AFTER the first week (oops.)</li>
<li>The sign up mechanism is connected to <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">webmaker.org/teach</a>, but signing up is not required for participation because everything is open. We cannot differentiate between traffic from participants and traffic from people who never signed up.</li>
<li>People don't always tag their stuff. Sometimes there are typos (e.g. #teactheweb).</li>
<li>We encouraged self created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/zythepsary.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al0Wg7eR7tHcdDRGVEJCMEFXbmRwV3RUamhHRVlfRHc#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">Study Groups</a> (not oops, but a fail if we're talking about metrics). Study Groups may be using other hashtags and special lists. There are several untrackable study groups using private groups, communities, forums, email, etc.</li>
<li>We are sure to miscount membership. There's members vs active members vs people who are also members of the main G+.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Data Viz</h4>
Finding better ways to collect metrics and share them as data visualizations would up participation. When people feel like they're alone in their learning experience, they're much more likely to reserve their participation until others join them. People are hungry for social learning experiences, and data viz is an easy way to show learners that they're not alone.
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://infogr.am/teachtheweb-27148\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"490\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uiZjlxS.png\" width=\"500\" /></a>Here's a shoddy infographic on #teachtheweb.</p>
<h3>Community and tiers of engagement</h3>
At the beginning of #teachtheweb, we talked about three levels of engagement. These levels may eventually be associated with Mozilla Mentor Badges.
<ol>
<li><strong> Mentor-in-Making (level 1)</strong> Be explicit about the agency people have over their own learning by helping them understand there are no deadlines, responsibilities, or criteria for participation. Give them permission to work at their own speed. People aren't used to this. For someone to move from a Mentor-in-Making level to Mentor, <strong>community at higher levels need to serve as examples</strong> in the way they moderate and mentor. The progression to Mentor is extremely transient – Mentors-in-Making who are enthusiastic about their learning will undoubtedly make resources or run events that fulfill the criteria for the Mentor badge.</li>
<li>
[caption id=\"attachment_1929\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"100\"]<img alt=\"Mentor Badge\" class=\" wp-image-1929    \" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mentor-badge-150x150.png\" width=\"100\" /> Mentor Badge[/caption]
<strong>Mentor (level 2)</strong> Progression happens when Mentors-in-Making begin to mentor their peers and creating new open educational resources or run in-person events that teach openness and web skills. <strong>Celebration of participation at this level is as important as participating itself.</strong> The more interaction the typical learner receives from the community and moderators, the more they participate. Helping mentors understand their own agency in this process is very important as well. Advancing through the tiers of engagement requires people at higher engagement levels actively monitoring and mentoring in the various channels and being examples for their peers. Peer to peer learning and support is integral to sustaining the community. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/introducing_mentor_badges\" target=\"_blank\">We've launched this level</a> as the <strong>first Mozilla Webmaker Mentor Community badge</strong>. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/mentor\" target=\"_blank\">Apply for your Mentor badge!</a></li>
<li><strong> Super Mentor (level 3)</strong> Inspiring people to advance to Super Mentor status requires a personal touch and an ambient personification of open values. Again, celebration from the community as well as core staff is massively important. At the highest level, the community is looking for collaborators, mentorship and advice from the \"experts\" in the field. Finding ways to connect Super Mentors with Mentors is important for the cross over from Mentor to Super Mentor. Super Mentors are linked to sustained contribution – be it creating resources for someone else to teach with, running events or mentoring others. <strong>We'll be figuring out more succinct criteria and issuing for the Super Mentor Badge in the coming months.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Moderation + Mentoring</h4>
<strong>Be open from the get-go.</strong> Asking active community members to moderate and mentor potential community members displays trust, which leads to empowerment. <strong>A mistake to avoid</strong> is trying to select only certain community members to contribute to the planning and moderation of the online learning experience. Instead, certain community members should receive personal outreach and asks, but the community as a whole should receive an invitation to contribute.
<h3>Content Creation</h3>
<a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/planning/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Planning #teachtheweb\">Asking for \"braindumps\"</a> was a great way to get a lot of different ideas, but we may have gotten more contribution had we prepared more topic specific questions that helped people formulate their thoughts around base ideas. Keeping the it in an open form, like <a href=\"http://etherpad.mozilla.org\" target=\"_blank\">Etherpad</a>, allowed people to riff off each other's ideas, which made it easier to find patterns and threads.
However, content contributions dropped steadily throughout the nine weeks. Here's a graph:<img alt=\"contentcontributors_graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1924\" height=\"394\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contentcontributors_graph.png\" width=\"498\" />
<strong>It's draining to do active engagement while concurrently creating content.</strong> Because active conversation needs to take place if we want people to move up the tiers of engagement, preparing content and content creation mechanisms in advance is recommended. This procedure can, in and of itself, be an outreach method and works well under specific deadlines.
It might help to ask specific people to contribute to specific things based on interest and expertise. No amount of begging will help in the content creation department though, so <strong>be prepared to do the heavy lifting!</strong>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" height=\"738\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cfLzl5r.png\" />If we intend to do multiple initiatives like #teachtheweb, it would be useful to have a place where all this content can land. Wordpress might be the right technology, but our structure needs to change. Having better tools for filtering and connecting the <a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\">G+ Community</a> to the wordpress structure would be helpful. We might just need to take more time and more expertise setting up wordpress to be more user friendly for online learning.
The G+ firehose is also something to think about. <strong>There are pros and cons to using G+</strong>. For administration, there is no overview of G+, no substructuring, no archiving and it's difficult to find things (unless you know very specifically what something is called, who posted it, etc). It's a social network rather than a knowledge management system.
Additionally, despite attempts at categories, people don't tag and organize their own posts beyond the default stream. A more useful tool, in my view, would be some sort of a kick ass forum where everyone is together, could separate into groups within the structure, can tag, comment and share. <a href=\"http://discourse.org/\">Yes, I'm thinking something specific here.</a>
The facts that we've already built such a large community and that our potential community is likely already using G+ means that it would be difficult to move people from G+ to another system. However, it is something to consider.
If we intend to do multiple online learning experiences like teachtheweb, with a variety of audiences, topics and hashtags – we should think about modifying the existing system to <strong>make it easier for everyone to see what's happening in the community</strong> without having to invest the hours it would take to get an overview of this experience.
<h3>Duration & Modularity</h3>
Something that wasn't clear with the #teachtheweb online learning experience is that someone can join in any time. Advertising the experience as \"a nine week course\" was both true to form and misleading, particularly because we transitioned into <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/party\" target=\"_blank\">Maker Party</a> and aren't actually going anywhere.<strong> The only thing that's different now is that we won't send curated content every week.</strong> We're still active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> and in<a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\" target=\"_blank\"> the G+ community</a>.
Instead of having new topics each week, we might think about having monthly themes. It's lower bar than a 9 week collection of topics, but it means we'll have various groups dipping in and out of content.
<strong>#teachtheweb had a comparatively low attrition rate.</strong> In #teachtheweb approximately 18% of participants were still active in the final week.<strong> This is pretty awesome</strong>, considering that the average MOOC has less than 10% of participants in the final week*. This data is mostly speculative because I didn't really take the time to do full analysis week by week of participants and their online actions. I just compared share and tweet numbers between Week 1 and Week 8, if someone wants to do a full analysis, let me know, and I'll share the data I have :)
If we're going to run varying lengths and varying content, we should think about finding a way that this form of work can always tie together, yet stand alone. It has a lot to do with the tiers of participation, and the technology we use to post this content.
<h4>Time Boxing Pros and Cons</h4>
<div style=\"width: 53%; float: left; margin-right: 1em;\">
<strong> Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>lots of excitement and involvement right away</li>
<li>easy to set a rhythm for production, meetings, etc</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style=\"float: left; width: 44%;\">
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>people think it ends and, therefore, don't sign up if they feel they are late</li>
<li>no room for schedule shifts</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Subversive engagement + humor</h3>
Finding ways to joke and play in an online space like #teachtheweb seems really important. Experimenting with subversive +mentioning in G+, random tweeting at people and sharing relevant but goofy things from across the web helps with keeping contribution up. It might not seem like something you need to plan for, but it actually is. Finding humorous and relevant shares and/or makes can be time consuming.
<h3>Making</h3>
<a href=\"https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-make-a-kit-template/remix\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/images/assembly_thumb.png\" width=\"150\" /></a>We launched the <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">hackable templates</a> through #teachtheweb. We launched dirty prototypes, and people took them and used them in ways we'd never imagined. These templates have already become staple in Mozteach content. They continue to be an extremely successful model for Mentor content creation.
<strong>Make stuff.</strong> Give optional readings. Maybe some videos. But <strong>focus on making stuff.</strong> No discussion to be had. Inspire people to make and then be blown away by what happens.
<h3>Tell Me Stuff</h3>
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this post and am happy to answer questions. It's a long post, but could have been much longer.

<p>So in what is probably a rather poorly kept secret I now no longer work for the Mozilla Foundation, in fact my last day was last week but in an attempt to stay ‘offline’ for a little while after that I’m only starting to look at the blogs and that kind of stuff again now. </p>
<h3>tl;dr</h3>
<ul>
<li>with everything that they’re doing, and everything not work related that I’ll now need to be doing it felt like a good time to go</li>
<li>not sure what the future hold yet – but let me know of anything interesting you have (rossbruniges at gmail dot com)</li>
<li>mozilla is a great place to work – I’m happy to have done so and hopefully left a good legacy of websites, standards and friends!</li>
</ul>
<p><span id=\"more-313\"></span></p>
<h3>But why?!</h3>
<p>I was there over 2 years and saw us grow from a team of roughly 15 (possibly not even that) to one that’s now well over 60 – it was quite and growth and it’s now quite a team but when I look at things it was a good time for me to go. At a time when they needed me at my very best I had <a href=\"http://www.thecssdiv.co.uk/2013/05/the-bad-week/\">too many external things happening</a> to also give them what I wanted, a lot of the sites that I made last year were in the process of being re-written and a couple of projects I helped get off the ground are now coming to a close; hopefully I’ve left a good stable launch pad for their next attack on making the next generation of webmakers.</p>
<h3>So what have I left behind?</h3>
<p>A lot of websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://mozillaignite.org\">Mozilla Ignite</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://mozillaopennews.org\">Mozilla Open News</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://www.thecssdiv.co.uk/source.mozillaopennews.org\">source.mozillaopennews.org</a></li>
<li><a href=\"https://gameon.mozilla.org\">GameOn (2012)</a></li>
<li>Mozilla Festival:

<li><a href=\"http://mozillafestival.org\">Mozilla Festival (2012)</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://2011.mozillafestival.org\">Mozilla Festival (2011)</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>including a couple that are now no longer around (<a href=\"https://drumbeat.org\">mozilla drubmeat</a>) and the ‘old’ (or better sounding version 1.0) of <a href=\"https://webmaker.org\">webmaker.org</a>. I also contributed code to <a href=\"https://mozillalabs.com/projects/\">Mozilla Labs</a>, <a href=\"https://mozilla.org\">mozilla.org</a> and even removed a <blink> from <a href=\"http://myfavoritebeer.org/\">the very first demo-site showing Mozilla Persona</a>!</p>

<p>An office that hopefully will continue to hold awesome webdev events (I’ve hosted Djugl and LWS there in recent months), hackdays and Mozilla parties; and one that I’m looking to head back to for epic events soon.</p>
<h3>So what’s next?</h3>
<p>As of right now I don’t really have any future plans – no new job lined up and I’ve not put too much thought into where I go next; after a long time of work, work work I’m going to re-charge my batteries, get writing again and play around with a few things that I’ve yet to play with and be around for some people who could do with my help right now.</p>
<p>Saying that if you’ve got a cool job going or know of one then I’ve got time to meet up and talk so let me know – rossbruniges at gmail dot com</p>
<h4>Speaking opportunities?</h4>
<p>Something that has meant that I’ve not done as much of this as I would like is that it always takes me a while to write a talk – but I now have a bit of time, so if you want to hear me talk about things, how things work at Mozilla, working remotely, getting things done or anything else let me know – rossbruniges at gmail dot com.</p>
<h3>Is Mozilla still a good place to work at?</h3>
<p><strong>YES</strong> – and they’re hiring so head over to <a href=\"http://careers.mozilla.org/#sections\">careers.mozilla.org</a> and see what is there. There are coding jobs but also account manager, project and events manager roles and if you love the web and want to work with other people who do then this is an awesome, challenging but also rewarding place to be. I you want to ask about any of the roles please feel free to get in touch and I’ll see what I can say and try and put you in touch with the right people. But the very best thing you can do is apply – that’s what I did over two years ago and it was a great ride from then on.</p>
<p>They say ‘once Mozilla, always Mozilla’ – and I’m proud to be able to be included in that collective now.</p>" nil nil "15126e38f230c084bdba2eea9c63a4d2") (229 (20949 15560 757847) "http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/2013/06/mozilla-summit-summit-assembly-planning.html" "Michael Coates: Mozilla Summit - Summit Assembly Planning Event" "Michael Coates" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 06:00:00 +0000" "About 10 days ago a group of around 70 Mozillians met in the Mozilla Paris office for two full days of brainstorming, planning, and discussions. The purpose of the event was to generate ideas, topics and hot issues that should drive different themes and tracks at the upcoming Mozilla summit.<br /><br />The planning event was organized as an \"unconference\". There were many merits to the open nature of this approach. It surfaced important issues and gave flexibility for the day to focus on important issues on people's minds. However, I would encourage those that are leading an unconference event to set a bit of high level context. Free flowing structure is great, but a little bit of overall goal setting is also a good complimentary item.<br /><br />During the event I led two micro sessions on topics that were important to me. The first sessions was \"Building a Framework for Decision Making at Mozilla\". This micro session was merged with another related topic suggested by Jishnu titled \"The Nature of Dissent\". The micro session was well attended with a lot of great ideas. More to come on this over the coming weeks. I'm planning to work with the team to flush out the framework and present at brown bags leading up to the summit.<br /><br />The second microsession was centered around understanding the end user when designing security and privacy features. A strong point that was raised during this micro session was the idea of identifying the user types, their desires for greater security controls, and the types of trade offs they may be interested in making (if any) for these additional features. The main point was that an understanding of the target audience is required when building additional features and security & privacy features are no different here. We have more work to do on this topic, but there's a lot of valuable information that can come from this.<br /><br />The next steps after the summit assembly are to continue working with group leads to flush out the various summit tracks. Much more information to come. But based on the energy and enthusiasm at the assembly planning event I think we're going to have a fantastic Summit in just a few months.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: small;\">--<br /></span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span>mcoates</span></span><span> </span><br /><span>mozillian</span>" nil nil "a2496fd182a3540688b44900165da82f") (228 (20949 15560 757347) "http://globau.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/happy-bmo-push-day-52/" "Byron Jones: happy bmo push day!"

"selena" "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 23:29:22 +0000" "<p><em>This is a lightly edited version of an email I sent to pgsql-hackers today.</em></p>
<p>Josh Berkus asked:</p>
<p><strong>> How should reviewers get credited in the release notes?</strong></p>
<p>Without getting into how the community might decide to do this, I thought it might be helpful to share the reasons why I believe recognizing and expressing gratitude to reviewers is a helpful, useful and gratifying exercise for the Postgres community.</p>
<p>I support crediting reviewers in a more formal way than we currently do for a few different reasons.</p>
<p>First, I believe it’s worth finding a way to say “Hey, you just did something great for Postgres”, publicly, to a bunch of people who could have spent their valuable time and energy in some other way.</p>
<p>Second, reviewers get better at their work by reviewing multiple times – so I’d like to encourage people to review more than once.</p>
<p>Third, reviewers don’t always need to be expert developers, or experts at Postgres to get started, but many people who do open source work have no idea this is true. Public recognition helps make it clear that we have people who give useful reviews and are relative novices.</p>
<p>We also have several different kinds of reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>“does it compile”</li>
<li>style/typo/easily seen bug passes</li>
<li>in-depth discussion of design choices, use case, interface</li>
<li>complex testing cases</li>
<li>performance testing</li>
<li>pre-commit checks for more subtle bugs or committer preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those, except probably the very last, can be done by people who are familiar with Postgres or its configuration, but aren’t necessarily Postgres or C experts.</p>
<p>Fourth, we have very few accepted ways to recognize contributions to Postgres. Naming in Release Notes is one way this community has consistently supported as a <em>public</em> way to say “hey, you just did something great for Postgres”. The complete list of ways I’m aware of are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recognizing major, minor and emeritus contributors</li>
<li>Making someone a committer</li>
<li>Being part of the -core group</li>
<li>Naming authors by name in commit messages (but without consistent metadata, making it difficult to count well)</li>
<li>Naming authors in release notes</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s pretty much it. That’s great for the people who have already secured positions through seniority, or because they’re amazing C hackers. I don’t know if I need to lay out for everyone the value of public recognition – if you want me to I can enumerate them. But the benefits of public recognition are huge — both in a social and a financial sense.</p>
<p>Currently, the only way I know of to be recognized for work on Postgres that is <em>not</em> seniority or code-related is #1. If you’re a reviewer, there’s almost no chance you’ll be recognized in our list of contributors without some additional, very significant contribution to our community. (Please let me know if I’m mistaken about this — I only know what I know!) Adding names to Release Notes (or some variant of Release Notes) seems like a minor concession for work that we as a community need, value and want to encourage.</p>
<p>We are so few in terms of patch contributors – somewhere between 300-400 people contribute code to PostgreSQL each year based on the names I try to pull out of commits. I haven’t counted how many reviewers we have who do not also contribute patches separately.</p>
<p>Giving people appreciation for the review work they’re doing, for free, is a good thing for everyone. Naming more names helps describe the true scope of our community. Spreading gratitude is good for those who thank and those who receive thanks (like, proven scientifically!). And we increase the number of people who benefit directly from the work that they do here, by giving them something they can point their boss, their company and their colleagues to.</p>
<p>So, when we’re debating <em>how</em> recognition might be done, please don’t lose sight of <em>why</em> this is important in the first place.</p>" nil nil "b7791407008fcd81540e2e7720a1432b") (226 (20949 15560 756122) "http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2013/the-tale-of-selenium-bug-141.html" "David Burns: The tale of Selenium bug 141" nil "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 09:49:06 +0000" "<p>The selenium project has for a while now wanted to create a library that allows user emulation in the browser. The project has done a reasonable job at this so far with respect to this. We check if items are in the DOM, we check the visibility of items and we normalise text from the browser, amongst our other amazing talents!
</p><p>Our default position is we enforce the idea of emulation. \"How would a user do this action?\" is the main question we ask ourselves! So when a bug that doesn't meet that we tend not to implement it. One of these times is bug 141 - WebDriver lacks HTTP response header and status code methods. This is one of the most contentious bugs in the Selenium repository. People see Selenium as more than browser automation library, they see it as a web testing framework. Yes, Selenium RC was like this but then again Selenium RC also had ~140 methods hung off one object. We made a mistake in the past, let's try not to repeat it! Anyway, I digress,  in a web testing framework world there may be times where there are use cases where you need to find out data from the response header and status codes.
</p><p>So is this a feature we want to add to WebDriver? No. \"But David, we do!?!?!?\" I hear you cry! The use case that comes up regularly is I want to know if a server is returning a 404 or 500 when I access a page. Why is there a need to start a browser to find this out? When I asked this question on twitter, my friend and fellow committer Kevin Menard said that it could be useful to to see the page response on failure and some pages can only be accessed with a real browser. The use cases that Kevin had is you want to check that the endpoint that you originally hit might might change based on the user agent passed in or there might be a site that follows the single page idea and breaks push state and therefore most of the web semantics. I admit Kevin is right with those use cases. However its only looking at a small part of the issue and there are a lot of corner cases. The major one for me is watching XHRs. What if one of your XHR returns a 500 and you get an error? Should WebDriver show you that information as well? I am sure you can see how quickly this can escalate. If you start worrying about all requests, and you should if you are worried about the initial request to a page, then you want the browser to capture all of this information and return it in a standard format. There just happens to be a format called Http Archive (HAR).
</p><p>So does the project take the task of creating a mechanism for extracting a HAR from the browser? That could be near impossible on browsers that don't readily share network usage information. So we go from WebDriver being a browser automation framework for user emulation to browser automation framework for user emulation and networking information gathering. That might be a little obtuse but its meant to be.
</p><p>While Selenium's main use case is for test automation, is not solely designed for that. We want to be the best at browser automation. Proxies are really good at managing network information and reporting on it in standard formats. Examples are fiddler and browsermob-proxy. And you can even hook them into Selenium WebDriver! Like the following:
</p><p></p><pre class=\"brush: python\">from browsermobproxy import Server
server = Server(\"path/to/browsermob-proxy\")
server.start()
proxy = server.create_proxy()
from selenium import webdriver
profile  = webdriver.FirefoxProfile()
profile.set_proxy(proxy.selenium_proxy())
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile)
proxy.new_har(\"google\")
driver.get(\"http://www.google.co.uk\")
proxy.har # returns a HAR JSON blob
server.stop()
driver.quit()
</pre>
<p>Yes it might be a little verbose to use them but if you really want to see that type of information then you should do it properly otherwise the real errors, that you originally wanted, will go missing.
</p><p>Putting in half a solution into Selenium is just going to create scope creep and a large number of bugs because its not doing the \"right\" thing. The \"right\" thing is far too subjective for it to be done correctly.</p>" nil nil "4bea25f09a894647343594ac869e1200") (225 (20949 15560 752338) "http://oduinn.com/blog/2013/06/26/release-engineering-as-a-force-multiplier-at-google-techtalks/" "John O'Duinn: =?utf-8?Q?=E2=80=9CRelease?= Engineering as a Force =?utf-8?Q?Multiplier=E2=80=9D?= at Google TechTalks" "John" "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 08:31:51 +0000" "<p>I was super honored to present as part of the Google TechTalks series.

<p>This was the same keynote I gave at the Release Engineering conference in last month’s ICSE 2013, so if you missed it, <a href=\"http://oduinn.com/blog/2013/06/07/release-engineering-as-a-force-multiplier-relengcon-2013/\">click here for more context about the RelEng conference, and see the slides used.</a></p>
<p>Given the super-big scale of Google’s RelEng infrastructure, presenting to the very technical audience at Google was exciting. It was testimony to the work done by Mozilla’s RelEng that this was worthy of including in the Google Tech Talks series, the audience loved it, and the questions before/after were great. </p>
<p>Thanks to Boris for making this happen, and also for the great chats about Release Engineering at scale. It’s great to meet other people who are working passionately to solve software delivery pipeline problems at scale; it’s even greater when you find that you “click” and find you like each other as humans too. All very cool – thanks again, Boris.</p>" nil nil "dba77adbe617ef12098a45961fab79e5") (224 (20949 15560 751921) "http://work.erikvold.com/pathfinder/2013/06/26/introducing-addon-pathfinder.html" "Erik Vold: The Add-on Pathfinder" "Erik Vold" "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "<p>I took all of my Jetpack modules and put them in the <a href=\"https://github.com/erikvold/addon-pathfinder\">Add-on Pathfinder</a>.</p>
<h3>Add-on Pathfinder</h3>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>I’ve created this repository for a lot of reasons, and that is always the best one. It’s not worth going through them all however, so here are the ones worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the Add-on SDK needs a place where people can contribute to experimental modules rapidly, this means everything should happen on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a>, tests are optional, and auto-repacks are not an issue. I don’t think the SDK should become this, in my eyes the SDK should be the land of stable modules, and Pathfinder would be a land of experimental or nearly stable modules.</li>
<li>I feel I do my best work in a bottom-up design approach, which is how I see Pathfinder growing, I see the SDK as being developed in the opposite manner which has merits as well, such as stability. I am just one person tho and stability is just not something that I can offer for my range of modules, so I don’t feel that is the right approach for me. Teams have much greatly ability to offer stability.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>APIs will change in the Pathfinder, modules may move around too, be forewarned!</p>
<p>When this happens I will blog about it, and I’ll probably start a wiki page about this kind of thing too so that everyone has a reference that they can check.</p>
<p>Documentation badly needs updating..</p>
<p>I’m telling you all about Pathfinder now, despite the obvious need of work because I have abondoned the old repositories, and fixed many bugs in Pathfinder already which I have no intention of back porting.</p>

I've never been passionate about being a people manager, and I've always looked to reduce or eliminate that part of my role, but our pace of hiring always outstripped my ability to send my direct reports to other managers. Lately that's changed, partly because our hiring has slowed in the areas I touch, but also because we have more and better managers in the platform team to take up load. So, the people-management side of my role is finally shrinking. I think this is good for me and Mozilla --- I think my time and attention best serve Mozilla when used for tasks other than people-management. </p><p>This means if you're looking for someone responsible for running a Gecko platform team, it's probably not me anymore.

Sometimes it's about drawing on broad knowledge of Mozilla and the Web platform to instruct people. Sometimes it means trying to modify or review code no-one else will touch :-).

</li></ul>
<p>Over the coming weeks I’d like to introduce some of the key concepts as well as some of the issues that need your input.</p>
<p>First, I’d like to give an overview of where the spec comes from and what it covers.</p>
<h3>Why Web Animations? A summary of happenings until now</h3>
<p>On the Web today we have <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/\">CSS Animation</a> (including <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/\">Transitions</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html\">SVG Animation</a> and they both have their problems. For example, CSS is so simple it doesn’t even support synchronization and SVG is pretty hairy when it comes to interval negotiation and syncbase timing—and it’s SVG-only. Most of all though, they’re completely separate.</p>
<p>Also, Microsoft don’t support SVG Animation. They have consistently maintained that they want to see a single model for animation on the Web (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2011/03/02-svg-irc#T22-19-34\">minutes</a>) and that that model should have an API. That’s a very reasonable position in my mind, albeit frustrating for authors who want to use SVG Animation now.</p>
<p>The story since then is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>On several occasions throughout 2011 and 2012 I proposed various alternatives (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/F2F/Auckland_2011/Animation_improvements\">#1</a> – <a href=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/pres/SVG 2 Animation.html\">presentation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/F2F/Seattle_2011/Agenda/Animations/Harmonisation\">#2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/F2F/Sydney_2012/Agenda/Animations/WebAnimations\">#3</a>) for harmonizing the two such as importing SVG features into CSS and vice versa. People mostly just nodded in agreement and nothing happened.
</li><li>In January 2012, Adobe wisely suggested I <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2012/01/13-svg-irc#T23-14-43\">go away and prepare a concrete proposal</a> so people can get a feel for what is might look like. Adobe also offered to assist where they could.
</li><li>At the end of January 2012 I invited a contact from Google to join in since he had some great ideas about state machines.
</li><li>In March 2012 folks from Adobe, Google and I (Mozilla) got together in Tokyo and hacked out a first version of the spec.
</li><li>In May 2012 we <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fx/2012AprJun/0107.html\">got approval from the CSS and SVG working groups</a> to continue this work as an official work item.
</li><li>In September 2012 we presented a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvNQNtIfXXI\">demo of the work</a> at the <a href=\"http://svgopen.org/2012/\">Graphical Web conference in Zurich</a> (<a href=\"http://www.multimedia.ethz.ch/conferences/2012/svgopen/05-1_thursday?doi=10.3930/ETHZ/AV-f8a1c756-a4de-4e64-98f5-c2c0b90bc9af&autostart=false\">video recording</a>).
</li><li>In June 2013 we <a href=\"http://logs.csswg.org/irc.w3.org/css/?date=2013-06-04\">got approval from the CSS and SVG working groups</a> to publish a FPWD.
</li><li>Today (25 June 2013) we finally <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/\">published something</a>!
</li></ul>
<h3>What’s in the box?</h3>
<p>Basically, this:</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">
<img alt=\"Intersection of features provided by CSS, SVG, and Web Animations\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/CSS-SVG-Web-Animations-500.png\" />
</div>
<p>Web Animations is essentially a common model for animation that underlies CSS and SVG. It covers the common features of both plus a few only found in one or the other.</p>
<p>It also has a few extra features not currently found in either:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#grouping-and-synchronization\">Timing groups</a></dt>
<dd>This is the primary means of synchronization.<br />
It’s quite powerful but I’ll leave the details and justification for this to a separate post.</dd>
<dt>Speed control (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#speed-control\">#1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#timed-item-speed-control\">#2</a>)</dt>
<dd>This is a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/SVG2_Requirements_Input#SMIL_time_manipulation_module\">requested feature for SVG2</a> and may be useful for achieving reversing effects such as exposed in CSS.</dd>
<dt><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#custom-effects\">Custom effects</a> (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#the-customeffect-callback-interface\">API</a>)</dt>
<dd>This allows the Web Animations timing model to be used to drive animations of HTML canvas etc. by registering a script callback.</dd>
<dt><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#dfn-iteration-start\">Iteration start</a></dt>
<dd>This is a minor but much requested feature that allows you to start an animation part-way through its interval.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>What’s <em>not</em> included?</h3>
<p>Bear in mind that Web Animations is essentially a model. It’s not a declarative syntax. That’s something left to other specs. The API <em>happens</em> to be bundled with the model simply because that makes it easy to keep the two in sync.</p>
<p>The arrangement is as follows:</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">
<img alt=\"Intersection of features provided by CSS, SVG, and Web Animations\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Animations-and-other-specs.png\" />
</div>
<p>The CSS-specific features required for CSS animations and transitions will be covered in a separate specification, possibly called “CSS Animations/Transitions level 4” which expresses its features in terms of the Web Animations model.</p>
<p>Likewise, current SVG features such as syncbase timing, or targetting attributes (not just CSS properties) will be covered by a separate specification (my next task) expressed in terms of that model. That specification may be called something like “SVG Animation” but I suspect not since quite a few people have expressed interest in allowing it to apply to HTML content too.</p>
<p>Other features that are not included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bounce/spring timing functions</strong> – we really wanted to make this possible and have a couple of simple extensions to timing functions to allow this but we haven’t yet reached agreement about which one is best so we’re leaving them both out for now.<br />
The plan is to follow up with a separate specification which provides additional timing functions anyway.<br />
(In fact, with the current working draft, you can’t even do more than one timing function over an animation currently but that will be fixed in the next draft when we introduce chained timing functions).<p></p>
</li><li><strong>Media integration</strong> – this is something a lot of people have been asking for but we decided to postpone it in the interests of progressing the spec along.<br />
The good news is this <em>used</em> to be part of the spec so we know it integrates very cleanly.<br />
For now we’ll work on it in a separate spec and if that comes along quickly enough we might merge it back in.<p></p>
</li><li><strong>State machines</strong> – this is something that is very useful when you start programming UI interactions but something we decided is not critical for the first version of the spec.<br />
Again, we’ll probably work on this as a separate spec.
</li></ul>
<h3>API?</h3>
<p>Originally I opposed the idea of adding an API because I think declarative solutions are generally preferable. However, the API is useful in a few cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>It lets you inspect the state of all animations in the document. Anyone can build developer tools that present you with a timeline of all the running CSS animations/transitions/SVG animations in the document for debugging.
</li><li>It lets you make runtime changes to declarative animations—for many apps a combination of declarative and procedural approaches is the best fit and lets you achieve effects that might not be possible using purely declarative features.
</li><li>For some problems a procedural approach is suitable and in those cases using the API is both simpler than writing the animation loop yourself and also means the browser can optimise the animation for smoother performance and less battery consumption.
</li></ul>
<h3>Implementations?</h3>
<p><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/blink-dev/web$20animations/blink-dev/jDjDMTuKegI/Uh1qz44DSBsJ\">Work has started on implementation in Blink</a> and is <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875219\">on the radar for Gecko</a>. Until then <a href=\"https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js\">a polyfill</a> is coming along in leaps and bounds and covers nearly all of the FPWD.</p>
<p>That’s it for now. I’ll follow up with posts explaining specific features and issues needing input but if you have any feedback on the spec, don’t hesitate to send it along to <a href=\"mailto:public-fx@w3.org\">public-fx@w3.org</a> with subject <q>[web-animations]</q>.

<p>The following is my personal take on (a small portion of) the Persona market strategy.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Persona’s #1 selling feature is privacy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This was a guiding <b>design principle</b>, no doubt about it. It <b>absolutely</b> is not our #1 <b>selling</b> feature.</p>
<p>Our team wants to help mainstream users. Sadly, privacy (and security) aren’t their main concern.</p>
<p>Johannes makes some great points around Google’s use of OpenID, that losing information about where their users are going might be a negative in evaluating Persona.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Our team has focused on the following stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Websites – Relaying Parties (RP)
</li><li>Email providers – Identity Providers (IdP)
</li><li>Browser Vendors
</li><li>People using the web (Users)
</li></ul>
<p>For each of these, deep focus was put into the value proposition and finding the right balance in the technical details.</p>
<p>I’ve never been on such a <b>large scale Open Source project</b> that focused on <b>User Centered Design, Marketing, and Security</b>.</p>
<p>Let’s take IdPs which is Johannes’ main problem. If an IdP were to adopt Persona, they would get the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizations have the ability to control the security parameters for their domain
</li><li>Brand recognition on websites which use Persona.
</li><li>A SSO-like experience for enterprise, schools, and communities.
</li></ul>
<p>Without native IdP support, an organization that controls an SMTP routable domain name is subject to the email + password of the Persona fallback. They cannot add 2 factor auth. By running an IdP they can use Yubi-keys, RSA thumbdrives, or SMS verification… whatever.</p>
<p>Once they control the security, they would be more inclined to use Persona across their family of websites. This integration is much easier than traditional methods and lowers expenses.</p>
<p>The brand recognition comes by controlling the login screen. They get this today with OpenID and OAuth which I will call “Social Login” to simplify the argument. Social Login isn’t applicable to every RP.</p>
<p>We think that adding <a href=\"http://www.guanotronic.com/~serge/papers/chi13a.pdf\" title=\"My Profile Is My Password, Verify Me!<br /> The Privacy/Convenience Tradeoff of Facebook Connect by Serge Egelman\">Facebook Connect filters out 15% of your new users</a>. (We’d love to do a study and get reliable numbers here).</p>
<p>There is a long tail of websites which can’t use Social Login and will do authentication themselves. We think that Persona is viable for many of these websites. Thus a company can further spread their brand.</p>
<p>I agree with Johannes that Google won’t be the first large IdP. I don’t think that means Persona is irrelevant or destined to fail. Universities, email providers, and enterprise can improve their users security and smooth out login flows. Identity startups can start with a solid protocol and get Browser/Website integration for free.</p>
<h3>The IdP is Only One Stakeholder</h3>
<p>Those reasons are just some of the value propositions balanced against other factors during the design of Persona’s BrowserID protocol.</p>
<p>For RPs, there is a set. Here are a couple:</p>
<ul>
<li>No platform/vendor lockin (email based)
</li><li>Easy to implement (lower cost)
</li><li>Works across devices
</li><li>Improves security (DROP COLUMN password)
</li><li>Consistent sign in across the web
</li><li>Lower cost of authentication system (forgot your password, remove sending email for verification and forgot your password, etc)
</li></ul>
<p>Again this list is non exhaustive and I haven’t touched upon Browser Vendor or User value propositions which have been designed for.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I agree with Johannes that some businesses will avoid Persona early on. Perhaps they want a Facebook Connect sign in for extended profile information and social graph.</p>
<p>That is fine.</p>
<p>Persona can help a lot of people use the web in an easy to use and more secure manner. It doesn’t have to be everybody on day one <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://ozten.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<p>Johannes, you have a long history in this space. From meeting you, I know you care about user sovereignty (and many other important factors). Thanks for helping us find adoption problems with Persona.</p>

<hr />
<p>A few weeks ago I was told that, as a Mozilla employee, I could get a free <strong><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/\">Firefox OS</a></strong> phone. There were two caveats: it’s a developer preview, so it’s rough around the edges; and I’d have to ‘dogfood’ it – using it as my ‘daily driver’ and providing feedback to developers. I considered it for a while, flirted with the idea of an Android device, and then took the plunge last week. Since last Wednesday I’ve been using the <strong><a href=\"http://www.geeksphone.com/\">Geeksphone Keon</a></strong> as my main phone.</p>
<p><img alt=\"Firefox OS box\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36058\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ffos-box.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>Firefox OS is aimed primarily at the next billion web users, people who will experience the web for the first time through a mobile device. Instead of closed, proprietary platforms (or pseudo-open ones) the idea is that the entire ‘stack’ is open and easy to develop for. If you know HTML, CSS and JavaScript then you can create an app for a Firefox OS device. As someone who felt extremely empowered as a 16 year-old creating his first website, that’s something that certainly resonates with me.</p>
<p>Because of the aims of the Firefox OS ecosystem, the developer preview reference device (the Keon) is a pretty low-spec phone for 2013. The idea being, of course, that if an app runs smoothly on the reference device then it will run well on other devices. Although there’s some occasional lag, it’s a pretty slick experience – which makes me wonder what those quad-core beasts are doing with that extra processing power?</p>
<p>It would be disingenuous of me to pretend that the Keon does everything an iPhone or Android device does. Of course it doesn’t. I miss posting to Path, running with Nike+ and adding notes to Evernote. But to dismiss it based on current conceptions of what a mobile device should be would, I think, miss the point.

"mbest" "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 17:07:52 +0000" "<p dir=\"ltr\">Firefox 22 is now released, and I am very excited!  One of its key features is a new set of optimizations for asm.js, a highly optimizable subset of JavaScript.  asm.js was developed by Mozilla while working jointly with game industry leaders to find a path to port high performance C++ games to the Web.  That, however, is only the start of what it can do.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two main use cases that asm.js addresses.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">The first is bringing full native applications to the Web.  Using a tool called <a href=\"http://emscripten.org\">Emscripten</a>, C++ code can be cross-compiled to JavaScript, specifically the asm.js subset.  It integrates well with existing tool chains, as we have demonstrated by porting <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/03/27/mozilla-is-unlocking-the-power-of-the-web-as-a-platform-for-gaming/\">Unreal Engine 3 to the web in 4 days</a>.  That’s an incredible achievement considering we ported over a million lines of code.  This accomplishment provides a smooth path towards publishing existing applications on the Web, or for treating the Web as a platform alongside traditional desktop and console targets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another route is using asm.js and Emscripten to port libraries that require significant computing power.  HTML5 game developers sometimes find it hard to achieve an acceptable user experience should they seek to include performance intensive elements such as physics or pathfinding in their game.  This often leads to developers needing to optimize every bit of their game just to get something workable.  asm.js makes including these intensive elements more practical.  You can now use an asm.js compiled library, such as <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/ammo.js/examples/new/ammo.html\">Bullet</a> or <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/box2d.js/webgl_demo/box2d.html\">Box2d</a> for physics, to supercharge the 5%-10% of the code that does most of the work and write the rest by hand using traditional JavaScript.  This approach gives you the speed of near-native execution where you need it and the ease and flexibility of modern JavaScript everywhere else.  Emscripten provides the needed capabilities for creating coder friendly interfaces for asm.js libraries to make them easy to interact with.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/ammo.js/examples/new/ammo.html\"><img alt=\"Screen-Shot-2013-06-25-at-2.11.19-AM\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-49\" height=\"136\" src=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/mbest/files/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-25-at-2.11.19-AM-300x136.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is not limited to games.  The performance it can bring to web applications opens up many interesting possibilities for speeding up existing web tasks, or bringing new experiences to the Web.  Efforts to port video decoders and <a href=\"http://blog.bitops.com/\">photo processing tools</a> using asm.js are also seeing performance increases from taking advantage of existing C++ code without plugins or browser-specific technology.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">There have been several attempts to provide a solution for C++ developers wishing to target the Web.  We believe asm.js is the best solution, and here are a few of our reasons why:</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">1.  It’s just JavaScript.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is compatible with existing browsers.  Emscripten cross-compiled code requires Typed Arrays, a feature that is well-supported by modern browsers today, including Internet Explorer. There is no need to wait years for the technology to spread, or take the risk that it never will.  Furthermore, asm.js is a formalization of a pattern of JavaScript that web browsers have already been optimizing for, namely compiled C/C++ as generated by Emscripten and Mandreel, and a sample of that type of code appears in a popular benchmark, Google Octane.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">2. It’s fast.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to all of the work browsers have already done to optimize JavaScript in general and compiled C++ in particular (in part due to such code appearing in Octane), it is very easy for browser vendors to optimize for it and unlock its full potential — it took a single Mozilla developer about 3 months to implement <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Javascript:SpiderMonkey:OdinMonkey\">OdinMonkey</a>, our asm.js optimization module for Firefox.  Google developers also quickly achieved large speedups on asm.js, as reported in their <a href=\"http://news.softpedia.com/news/Chrome-May-Support-Mozilla-s-Asm-js-for-Native-Speed-Web-Apps-354281.shtml\">IO keynote</a>. In just a short time it is possible to get to about half the native speed of C++.  That’s faster than Java, in the case of Box2D.  That is just the first draft – we expect to get much closer to native performance with additional development on the browser side.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">3. It dramatically reduces the cost of supporting the Web.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">For developers already working with C++, Emscripten makes the Web just another port target.  Once it’s integrated into your tool chain, the web version can be recompiled alongside your other platforms whenever any updates are needed.  We have ported full properties in very short time periods.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">4. It reduces or eliminates the need for plugins.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">Companies that turn to plugins to enable their games or applications often see a significant friction in user adoption due to security warnings.  asm.js provides an alternative path that eliminates the security messaging issue while still providing much of the performance, all within a safe execution environment.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">5. It enables reuse of existing C++ libraries.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">There is a wealth of open source C++ libraries out there waiting to come over to the Web.  This is a vast amount of coding effort whose value has now been unlocked for web developers.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is still a new technology, and we have plenty of work to do to provide its full potential to the developer community.  Mozilla is grateful to Epic and other game industry leaders that have already started to work on products using asm.js.  These early <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">examples</a> are helping to prove the value, shape the technology, and encourage other browsers to priorities optimizations for it.  The best way to help support the development of asm.js is to start using it and let us know what you think by adding comments to this post.  If you are a game developer or have a performance intensive application and choose to port it over, share your work with the world and let us know about it!</p>

In my case this is the Keon made by <a href=\"http://www.geeksphone.com/#feat\" target=\"_blank\">Geeksphone</a>. This is a so called Developer preview of the phones which are going to change the way we connect to the Web. It's completely based on HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.<br />Although my language Frisian isn't supported yet on these phones, I continue to localize all the necessary strings, so hopefully in the near future, when these phones come to The Netherlands, it will be picked up by the providers.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uEO9-xbDfD0/Uclz7bSCl5I/AAAAAAAAAKk/g0wZdy_I1Xo/s1600/20130624_184644.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uEO9-xbDfD0/Uclz7bSCl5I/AAAAAAAAAKk/g0wZdy_I1Xo/s640/20130624_184644.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a>So, let's see what's in the box I received from Mozilla. My daughters first question was, \"can I <b>play</b> with the <b>mobile</b>?\" I said, \"sure\". Kids are a good way to test functionality and userfriendlyness. So with her and her friends we unboxed the Keon.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_yQazezFe1o/Ucl0X4r7J9I/AAAAAAAAAKs/5l1uaaK8bbg/s1600/20130624_185014.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_yQazezFe1o/Ucl0X4r7J9I/AAAAAAAAAKs/5l1uaaK8bbg/s640/20130624_185014.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a>First look at the box already shows a different type of packing, instead of the normal flat boxes the Keon is boxed in a cube with lots of icons on the covers. And this cube opens up another triangular box which shows the phone as it is laying in a showcase.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p_QaH-NA2YM/Ucl0YAEQIFI/AAAAAAAAALE/7PZ7hnKGAQc/s1600/20130624_185134.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p_QaH-NA2YM/Ucl0YAEQIFI/AAAAAAAAALE/7PZ7hnKGAQc/s640/20130624_185134.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />First touch of the phone feels a bit heavy in spite of it's size. I really love the orange colour though, somehow looks like it's made for the Dutch market already. Only 3 physical buttons, 1 power and 2 for volume. Furthermore the normal necessary things, microphone, speaker, headphone- and powerconnection.<br /><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sRvub1t1n2A/Ucl0Y8NjFyI/AAAAAAAAALI/YqMcGHIU4V0/s1600/20130624_185535.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sRvub1t1n2A/Ucl0Y8NjFyI/AAAAAAAAALI/YqMcGHIU4V0/s640/20130624_185535.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />So let's get started, where's the rest? Well, that's well hidden away in the triangular box behind the phone.<br /><br />All the things to get started and make the phone usefull, like battery, powercable, headphone, manual and some swag. The cover removes easily for placing the battery and I decided to place my SIM-card and SD-card too. All pretty well accessible.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCeeYz9EIi8/Ucl0ZCwEUcI/AAAAAAAAALc/embjeE5JNKg/s1600/20130624_190238.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCeeYz9EIi8/Ucl0ZCwEUcI/AAAAAAAAALc/embjeE5JNKg/s640/20130624_190238.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />So let's bring some live into this phone, power it up and hé, it starts immediately when pushing the power button. Apparently the battery was pre-loaded. Seeing the Geeksphone-logo come by and the Firefox-logo makes me feel proud being part of Mozilla for accomplishing this, great work!<br />After following the First Time Usage manual I am ready to start.

Being used to a Galaxy S2, I miss the menu and back-button, they don't exist. There is only a Home-button outside the screen in the middle below, menu- and back-buttons are presented on the screen itself depending on the application you started. First impression is that responsiveness of the touchscreen is a little lame, but again I am used to a S2 which costs around €500, the Keon is for sale for €89. After a little swiping around I am quite impressed with the speed though.<br />Only 4 buttons on the home-screen, 1 screen to the left and 2 to the right. All buttons are made in a circle.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZKzjLpHWXMU/Ucl0aF70PcI/AAAAAAAAALw/oXt_7frbs58/s1600/20130624_203830.jpg\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZKzjLpHWXMU/Ucl0aF70PcI/AAAAAAAAALw/oXt_7frbs58/s320/20130624_203830.jpg\" width=\"240\" /></a></div>Jumping right to the Settings to hook this thing up to the Internet.

I’ve been paying special attention to the time required to reach the “first paint” startup milestone: the point in time when the first Firefox window becomes visible.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The analysis has mostly consisted of profiling the latest Firefox Nightlies using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Performance/Profiling_with_Xperf\">XPerf</a> on a reference dual-core Windows 7 laptop with a magnetic HDD. I’ve been working on several bugs arising from the investigation (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881575\">bug 881575</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881578\">bug 881578</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=827976\">bug 827976</a>,  <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=879957\">bug 879957</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=873640\">bug 873640</a>) and I have many more coming. This is an overview of a few challenges I’ve run into over the last month.</p>
<h3>Making Startup Times Reproducible</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wanted to evaluate the impact of my experimental code changes by comparing startups, but I quickly discovered that there is a tremendous amount of variation in startup times in my test environment. I then turned off <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefetcher\">Windows Prefetching</a> & <a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/windows-vista-superfetch-and-readyboostanalyzed,1532-2.html\">Windows SuperFetch</a>, two performance features responsible for pre-fetching files from disk based on the user’s usage patterns, but I still recorded excessive variation in start times.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I then turned off a plethora of 3rd-party and Windows services that were running in the background and accessing the disk: Windows Update & Indexing Service, OEM “boot optimizer” software, Flash & Chrome automatic updaters, graphics card configuration & monitoring software bundled with drivers, etc. After rebooting the laptop several times and disabling any remaining programs causing disk activity, I was finally able to achieve reproducible startup times. I expected that cold starts would be dominated by disk I/O, but I was suprised by just how heavily I/O operations dominated startup time in a vanilla Firefox install.</p>
<h3>Startup time has improved almost 30% over the last year</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In an attempt to reproduce the startup regression reported in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=818257\">bug 818257</a>, I compared time to first paint for Firefox 13.0.1 and Firefox 21.0 using my test setup. To my surprise, I found Firefox 21.0 (current release channel) requires roughly 4.6 seconds to reach first paint during cold starts, while Firefox 13.0.1 (release channel from a year ago) required ~6.4 seconds! This is almost a 30% reduction in startup time.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aq4ElA0owpEbdDhMNjh0V3pDT09Hck82UnZRaWJRTXc&single=true&gid=0&output=html\">See the raw results from 5 runs in a Google Docs spreadsheet here</a></p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was surprised by this result because I expected increases in code size and the overhead from initializing new components added over the course of a year to cause regressions in startup. On the other hand, many people have landed patches to improve startup by postponing component initialization and generally reducing the amount of work done before the first-paint milestone. I haven’t tried to identify the patches responsible yet, but from a quick look at the XPerf profiles for each version, it looks like there were gains from fixing <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=756313\">bug 756313</a>  (“Don’t load homepage before first paint”) and from changing the list of Mozilla libraries pre-loaded at startup (see <em>dependentlibs.list</em>).</p>
<h3>We are still FSYNC-ing too much at startup</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apparently, the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364439%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\">FlushFileBuffers</a> function on Windows causes the OS  to flush everything in the write-back cache as it <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ce_base/archive/2006/03/15/increasefsthroughput.aspx\">“does not know what part of the cache belongs to your file”</a>. As you can imagine, calling FlushFileBuffers is bad news for Firefox startups even it’s done off the main thread — other I/O requests will be delayed while the disk is busy writing data. Unfortunately we are currently calling this method on browser startup to write out the <em>webapps.json</em> file, the <em>sessionstore.js</em> file, and several SafeBrowsing files. The flush method isn’t being called directly, rather it’s the <em>SafeFileOutputStream</em> and <em>OS.File.writeAtomic()</em> implementations that force flushes for maximum reliability. In general, we should avoid calling methods that fsync/FlushFileBuffers unless such reliability is explicitly required, and I’ve asked <a href=\"http://dutherenverseauborddelatable.wordpress.com/\">Yoric</a> to change <em>OS.File.writeAtomic()</em> behavior to forego flushing by default.</p>
<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next steps</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’m continuing to work on reducing the number of DLL loads triggered at startup and I’ll soon be filing bugs for fixing some of the smaller sources of startup I/O.</p>" nil nil "1954a5ee46b0a3460378b1a531e41c23") (214 (20949 15560 739001) "https://staktrace.com/spout/entry.php?id=800" "Kartikaya Gupta: Unraveling coordinate systems" "stak" "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 03:28:21 +0000" "<p class=\"blogEntry\">For the last few weeks I've been hacking away at a jungle of coordinate systems in the graphics code, trying to make code easier to understand and to work with. This work is technically part of the effort to make subframes asynchronously scrollable in OMTC, but it has helped us to fix other bugs as well. This post a braindump of the coordinate systems I've uncovered and the mental model I have.
<br />
<br />As of this writing, I have defined four \"pixel\" types in <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/Units.h\">layout/base/Units.h</a>. These are CSSPixel, LayoutDevicePixel, LayerPixel, and ScreenPixel. CSSPixel is the simplest - it represents a CSS pixel, which is what web content authors use to specify dimensions of things. Almost every Web API [1] deals with CSS pixels.
<br />
<br />In the days of yore, 1 CSS pixel corresponded exactly to one screen pixel. That is, when you created a div that was 50 CSS pixels wide, it would show up as 50 pixels wide on your screen. If you have a desktop monitor that is 1024 pixels wide [2] and you create a div that is 1024 CSS pixels wide, it takes up your entire monitor width. Makes sense, right?
<br />
<br />Now, let us enter the world of HiDPI display devices. On HiDPI devices, the screen pixels are so small and packed together so tightly that mapping 1 CSS pixel to 1 screen pixel doesn't make sense any more. Sure, you can fit more on the screen, but it's too tiny to be readable or useful. So we have this concept of a widget scale. The <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/xpwidgets/nsBaseWidget.cpp#l421\">nsIWidget::GetDefaultScale()</a> returns a scaling factor to account for HiDPI displays. For example, see the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/gonk/nsWindow.cpp#l557\">gonk implementation</a> which makes B2G perform a scale amount based on the actual DPI of the device. This introduces a new coordinate system that layout refers to as \"device pixels\" and what I've called LayoutDevicePixels.
<br />
<br />In the layout code, the widget scale affects two main things. One is the size of the CSS viewport [3]. If we have a widget scale of 2.0, then each CSS pixel is 2 screen pixels wide, which means that on a 1024x768 screen with a maximized browser window, you can only fit 512 CSS pixels across. So the CSS viewport width is adjusted to account for this. The other is the scale factor from app units [4] to screen pixels. Instead of the usual 60 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel you would normally get, setting a 2.0 widget scale results in 30 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel. This effectively makes each CSS pixel twice as wide when being rendered to the screen, which is the point of the whole exercise.
<br />
<br />But that's not all! There is another factor that comes into play between CSS pixels and LayoutDevicePixels, and that is the \"<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsPresContext.cpp#l1399\">full zoom</a>\". This is when, on desktop Firefox, you perform the \"Zoom In\" or \"Zoom Out\" actions. Doing a \"Zoom In\" action increases the full zoom, which works almost identically to increasing the widget scale. That is, setting a zoom of 110% is pretty much equivalent to having a widget scale of 1.1. The only difference I'm aware of is that if you specify your CSS dimensions in real-world units such as inches, then they are affected by the widget scale but not by the \"full zoom\". Tricksy!
<br />
<br />So to summarize what we have so far: in a world with just CSSPixels and LayoutDevicePixels, dimensions are specified in CSSPixels by content authors, and the browser maps them to LayoutDevicePixels based on the widget scale and full zoom. These LayoutDevicePixels are then displayed 1:1 on screen pixels as defined by the underlying platform.
<br />
<br />But what about mobile? Welcome to the land of OMTC and pinch-zoom. OMTC stands for off-main-thread compositor, and is what allows you to pinch a page on Fennec and have it instantly zoom. What's happening here is the painted page is transformed in OpenGL [5], without Gecko really knowing about what's going on. Since Gecko isn't repainting anything, this is super fast, and allows us to animate pinch-zoom at 60 frames per second (or close to it).
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, it also introduces a new coordinate system, because the LayoutDevicePixels that Gecko produced are no longer displayed 1:1 on the screen. Gecko could have painted something 10 LayoutDevicePixels wide (and so the texture uploaded to the graphics hardware would be 10 pixels wide) but then the user does a pinch-zoom and BAM! now it's taking up 20 pixels on the screen, because we told OpenGL to scale it up by 2x. So here we have our third pixel type defined: the ScreenPixel. In the preceding example the pinch-zoom produced a scale factor of 2.0 and so 10 LayoutDevicePixels would get mapped to 20 ScreenPixels.
<br />
<br />Now say you're viewing a page in Fennec and zoom in using pinch-zoom. And then you zoom in some more. And then some more. If all we did was take the LayoutDevicePixels and tell OpenGL to render them bigger by scaling it in hardware, you would end up with a very pixellated and blurry view of the page. In order to make it look good again, we have to go back to Gecko and tell it to repaint the visible area of the page at a higher density, allowing us to remove the OpenGL scaling. For example, instead of rendering a paragraph of text into a texture and scaling that up in OpenGL to display a single word really big, we can tell Gecko to just render that one word really big, and to use up the entire texture to do it. This is done by a call to <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsIPresShell.h#l1217\">nsIPresShell::SetResolution()</a>.
<br />
<br />Setting the resolution doesn't change our definition of CSSPixels or LayoutDevicePixels, but it does change something. To describe this change, we need to introduce a new coordinate system. This is the LayerPixel [6], and it sits between LayoutDevicePixel and ScreenPixel. That is, the resolution changes how many LayerPixels are produced for each LayoutDevicePixel, and now pinch-zooming affects the scale between LayerPixels and ScreenPixels. This is a little cyclical because as you perform a pinch-zoom, LayerPixels and ScreenPixels get farther apart in size. Then, once you finish the zoom, we tell Gecko to re-render the content at a new resolution such that LayerPixels and ScreenPixels are the same size once again, and we render the new LayerPixels at a 1:1 scale on the screen. When this happens the visible content goes from being blurry back to being sharp, which you can see in Fennec if you pay close attention when zooming in.
<br />
<br />So to summarize, here is what we have now:
<br />CSSPixel x widget scale x full zoom = LayoutDevicePixel
<br />LayoutDevicePixel x resolution = LayerPixel
<br />LayerPixel x OMTC transforms = ScreenPixel
<br />
<br />And so ends my braindump. Hopefully what I've written above will not change going forward, and the terms I've used can become part of the Gecko developer vocabulary, so that when dealing with code in different coordinate systems it's much easier to agree on what we mean.

<br />Notes:
<br />[1] <strike>The only exception I can think of is window.outerWidth, which is in screen pixels.</strike> (Edit 2013-06-27: I was wrong, I think outerWidth is also in CSS pixels.)
<br />[2] Note that the number of screen pixels displayed on a physical device may be modified by the operating system. For example, you can change your screen resolution from 1024x768 to 800x600, which changes the size and number of screen pixels. That's fine - we don't need to account for that in our code as the OS takes care of it.
<br />[3] The CSS viewport affects how wide the page is laid out by the layout code. One way of visualizing this is that if you have a page with just plain text, the text will be wrapped so that it doesn't exceed the CSS viewport width.
<br />[4] App units are what layout does all of its calculations in. One app unit is exactly one-sixtieth of a CSS pixel. The \"60\" was chosen because it has many integer factors and so allows representing common fractions losslessly.
<br />[5] The actual graphics system in use depends on the platform. OpenGL is just an example.
<br />[6] When Gecko paints the various elements on a page, it flattens them into \"layers\" that it hands off to the graphics stack. This is where the term LayerPixel comes from.</p>" nil nil "ca9dd79ae40c9f5ae12a8b43fdb379c4") (213 (20949 15560 737329) "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/rawkes/~3/ElExNBV2GaY/vizicities-supported-by-simudyne" "Rob Hawkes: Announcing Simudyne as the first supporter of ViziCities" nil "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000" "<p>Wow, it's been an amazing few days!

and Chef has taken off in recent years. And rightly so - these
pieces of software make the lives of countless system
administrators much better (in theory).</p>
<p>In their default (and common) configuration, these pieces of
software do a terrific job of ensuring a machine is provisioned with
<em>today's</em> configuration. However, for many server provisioning
scenarios, we actually care about <em>yesterday's</em> configuration.</p>
<p>In this post, I will talk about the importance of time when configuring
machines.</p>
<h3>Describing the problem</h3>
<p>If you've worked on any kind of server application, chances are
you've had to deal with a rollback. Some new version of a package
or web application is rolled out to production. However, due to
unforeseen problems, it needed to be rolled back.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps you operate a farm of machines that continuously build
or compile software from version control. It's desirable to be able
to reproduce the output from a previous build (ideally bit
identical).</p>
<p>In these scenarios, the wall time plays a crucial rule when dealing
with a central, master configuration server (such as a Puppet
master).</p>
<p>Since a client will always pull the latest revision of its
configuration from the server, it's very easy to define your
configurations such that the result of machine provisioning
today is different from yesterday (or last week or last month).</p>
<p>For example, let's say you are running Puppet to manage a machine
that sits in a continuous integration farm and recompiles a source
tree over and over. In your Puppet manifest you have:</p>
<pre><code>package {
\"gcc\":
ensure => latest
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you run Puppet today, you may pull down GCC 4.7 from the remote
package repository because 4.7 is the latest version available. But
if you run Puppet tomorrow, you may pull down GCC 4.8 because the
package repository has been updated! If for some reason you need
to rebuild one of today's builds tomorrow (perhaps you want to
rebuild that revision plus a minor patch), they'll use different
compiler versions (or any package for that matter) and the output
may not be consistent - it may not even work at all! So much for
repeatability.</p>
<p>File templates are another example. In Puppet, file templates are
evaluated on the server and the results are sent to the client. So,
the output of file template execution today might be different from
the output tomorrow. If you needed to roll back your server to an
old version, you may not be able to do that because the template
on the server isn't backwards compatible! This can be worked around,
sure (commonly by copying the template and branching differences),
but over time these hacks accumulate in a giant pile of complexity.</p>
<p>The common issue here is that time has an impact on the outcome of
machine configuration. I refer to this issue as <strong>time-dependent
idempotency</strong>. In other words, does time play a role in the
supposedly idempotent configuration process? If the output is
consistent no matter <em>when</em> you run the configuration, it is
time-independent and truly idempotent. If it varies depending on
when configuration is performed, it is time-dependent and thus
not truly idempotent.</p>
<h3>Solving the problem</h3>
<p>My attitude towards machine configuration and automation is that
it should be as time independent as possible. If I need to revert
to yesterday's state or want to reproduce something that happened
months ago, I want strong guarantees that it will be similar, if not
identical. Now, this is just my opinion. I've worked in environments
where we had these strong guarantees. And having had this luxury,
I abhore the alternative where so many pieces of configuration vary
over time as the central configuration moves forward without the
ability to turn back the clock. As always, your needs may be
different and this post may not apply to you!</p>
<p>I said <em>as possible</em> a few times in the previous paragraph.
While you could likely make all parts of your configuration time
independent, it's not a good idea. In the real world, things
change over time and making all configuration data static regardless
of time will produce a broken or bad configuration.</p>
<p>User access is one such piece of configuration. Employees come and
go. Passwords and SSH keys change. You don't want to revert user
access to the way it was two months ago, restoring access to a
disgruntled former employee or allowing access via a compromised
password. Network configuration is another. Say the network topology
changed and the firewall rules need updating. If you reverted the
networking configuration, the machine likely wouldn't work on the
network!</p>
<p>This highlights an important fact: <strong>if making your machine
configuration time independent is a goal, you will need to
bifurcate configuration by time dependency and solve for both.</strong>
You'll need to identify every piece of configuration and
ask <em>do I put this in the bucket that is constant over time or
the bucket that changes over time?</em></p>
<p>Machine configuration software can do a terrific job of ensuring
an applied configuration is idempotent. The problem is it typically
can't manage both time-dependent and time-independent attributes
at the same time. Solving this requires a little brain power, but
is achievable if there is will. In the next section, I'll describe
how.</p>
<h4>Technical implementation</h4>
<p>Time-dependent machine configuration is a solved problem. Deploy
Puppet master (or similar) and you are good to go.</p>
<p>Time-independent configuration is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the first step is to isolate all of the
configuration you want to be time independent. Next, you need to
ensure time dependency doesn't creep into that configuration. You
need to identify things that can change over time and take
measures to ensure those changes won't affect the configuration.
I encourage you to employ the <em>external system
test</em>: <em>does this aspect of configuration depend on an external
system or entity? If so how will I prevent changes in it over
time from affecting us?</em></p>
<p>Package repositories are one such external system. New package
versions are released all the time. Old packages are deleted.
If your configuration says to install the <em>latest</em> package, there's
no guarantee the package version won't change unless the package
repository doesn't change. If you simply pin a package to a specific
version, that version may disappear from the server. The solution:
pin packages to specific versions <strong>and</strong> run your own package
mirror that doesn't delete or modify existing packages.</p>
<p>Does your configuration fetch a file from a remote server or use
a file as a template? Cache that file locally (in case it
disappears) and put it under version control. Have the configuration
reference the version control revision of that file. As long as the
repository is accessible, the exact version of the file can be
retrieved at any time without variation.</p>
<p>In my professional career, I've used two separate systems for
managing time-independent configuration data. Both relied heavily
on version control. Essentially, all the time-independent
configuration data is collected into a single repository - an
independent repository from all the time-dependent data
(although that's technically an implementation detail). For Puppet,
this would include all the manifests, modules, and files used
directly by Puppet. When you want to <em>activate</em> a machine with
a configuration, you simply say <em>check out revision X of this
repository and apply its configuration.</em> Since <em>revision X</em> of
the repository is constant over time, the set of configuration
data being used to configure the machine is constant. And, if
you've done things correctly, the output is idempotent over time.</p>
<p>In one of these systems, we actually had two versions of Puppet
running on a machine. First, we had the daemon communicating with a
central Puppet master. It was continually applying time-dependent
configuration (user accounts, passwords, networking, etc). We
supplemented this was a manually executed standalone Puppet
instance. When you ran a script, it asked the Puppet master for its
configuration. Part of that configuration was the revision of the
time-independent Git repository containing the Puppet configuration
files the client should use. It then pulled the Git repo, checked
out the specified revision, merged Puppet master's settings for the
node with that config (not the manifests, just some variables),
then ran Puppet locally to apply the configuration. While a
machine's configuration typically referenced a SHA-1 of a specific
Git commit to use, we could use anything <em>git checkout</em> understood.
We had some machines running <em>master</em> or other branches if we didn't
care about time-independent idempotency for that machine at that
time. What this all meant was that if you wanted to roll back
a machine's configuration, you simply specified an earlier Git
commit SHA-1 and then re-ran local Puppet.</p>
<p>We were largely satisfied with this model. We felt like we got
the best of both worlds. And, since we were using the same
technology (Puppet) for time-dependent and time-independent
configuration, it was a pretty simple-to-understand system.
A downside was there were two Puppet instances instead of one.
With a little effort, someone could probably devise a way for
the Puppet master to <em>merge</em> the two configuration trees. I'll
leave that as an exercise for the reader. Perhaps someone has
done this already! If you know of someone, please leave a comment!</p>
<h4>Challenges</h4>
<p>The solution I describe does not come without its challenges.</p>
<p>First, deciding whether a piece of configuration is time dependent
or time independent can be quiet complicated. For example,
should a package update for a critical security fix be time
dependent or time independent? It depends! What's the risk of
the machine not receiving that update? How often is that machine
rolled back? Is that package important to the operation/role
of that machine (if so, I'd lean more towards time independent).</p>
<p>Second, minimizing exposure to external entities is hard. While
I recommend putting as much as possible under version control in a
single repository and pinning versions everywhere when you interface
with an external system, this isn't always feasible. It's probably
a silly idea to have your 200 GB Apt repository under version
control and distributed locally to every machine in your network.
So, you end up introducing specialized one-off systems as necessary.
For our package repository, we just ran an internal HTTP server that
only allowed inserts (no deletes or mutates). If we were creative, we
could have likely devised a way for the client to pass a <em>revision</em> with
the request and have the server dynamically serve from that revision
of an underlying repository. Although, that may not work for every
server type due to limited control over client behavior.</p>
<p>Third, ensuring compatibility between the time-dependent configuration
and time-independent configuration is hard. This is a consequence of
separating those configurations. Will a time-independent configuration
from a revision two years ago work with the time-dependent
configuration of today? This issue can be mitigated by first
having as much configuration as possible be time independent and
second not relying on wide support windows. If it's good enough
to only support compatibility for time-independent configurations
less than a month old, then it's good enough! With this issue, I feel
you are trading long-term future incompatibility for well-defined
and understood behavior in the short to medium term. That's
a trade-off I'm willing to make.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Many machine configuration management systems only care about
idempotency <em>today</em>. However, with a little effort, it's possible
to achieve consistent state over time. This requires a little extra
effort and brain power, but it's certainly doable.</p>
<p>The next time you are programming your system configuration tool, I
hope you take the time to consider the effects time will have and that
you will take the necessary steps to ensure consistency over time
(assuming you want that, of course).</p>" nil nil "3b33c8b1684a94bc24ec7de7bba4f361") (211 (20949 15560 734025) "http://www.laurathomson.com/2013/06/ode-to-morgamic/" "Laura Thomson: Ode to Morgamic" "laura" "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 18:47:07 +0000" "<p>Mike Morgan - <a href=\"http://morgamic.com/\">morgamic</a> - was my boss for nearly six years. Friday was his last day working at Mozilla. I wanted to  write something to memorialize his departure, in the same way <a href=\"http://morgamic.com/2013/05/06/ode-to-james-socol/\">he did for  others</a>. Of course, this blog post will not be as eloquent as if he had  written it, but I will do my best.</p>
<p>There are two things that stand out about Morgamic: his leadership, and his passion for the Mozilla and the Open Web.</p>
<p>Morgamic  is that rare leader who, rather than rallying the troops from the  front, leads from beside you, encouraging you every step of the way. Morgamic is an introvert. Never let anyone tell you introverts can’t  lead. He excels at leadership because of his special talents for  introspection, reflection and the ability and willingness to listen.</p>
<p>He taught me, by example, and by teaching me to ask the right questions, three important things about leadership:</p>
<p>Enable autonomy by quiet leadership. In six years, I don’t think he  ever really told me to do anything. Like Confucius, he simply asked  questions that helped me figure it out for myself.</p>
<p>Trust people. I  can get really mad about things being done in a way I consider wrong.  He always encouraged me to ask myself why someone might be doing it that  way, and to trust that they were doing the best they could.</p>
<p>Reframe problems. Mike sees problems as complex and nuanced. It’s  never black or white: you just have to zoom out a little to see a  million solutions to a problem that you might not have seen before.</p>
<p>We  certainly had disagreements over the last few years, but  we always managed to resolve them in a constructive way, and that might  be the greatest lesson of all. As a technical leader, he goes out of his  way to hire people that he is confident are smarter than him, and he  never gets insecure about it. (In my case, I’m not sure he was right. He  certainly outdoes me in wisdom.) He coaches those people into  excellence. Morgamic is a force multiplier. Not only that, but he cares  about his people, and will go out of his way to help them develop into  the best and happiest versions of themselves.</p>
<p>Virtually every website you use at Mozilla was made with Morgamic’s  hands, Morgamic’s help, or Morgamic’s leadership. We still use code from  the first web app he ever built for Mozilla, when he was a volunteer:  Every time you update or download Firefox, you can do that because of  Morgamic.</p>
<p>Morgamic also has a vision and a passion for the Mozilla Mission and  the Open Web. If you’ve ever talked with him about it, you’ll know  exactly what I mean. With Mike, it always came back to two questions:  How does this move the mission forward? How does this benefit the Open  Web?</p>
<p>He also manages to bring humor and humanity into every action:  whether it’s org charts with Care Bears, photoshopping your head onto a  meerkat, or presenting interns with trophies at the end of the summer.  Once, when I had a sick pet and he knew I was really upset, he sent me a  giant bunch of flowers (’From the webdev team’). That made me cry,  quite a lot, but in a good way, I swear. I still have that card on my  desk, and I tear up every time I look at it.</p>
<p>I’m not the only one with stories. Here are some from other people  who have had the pleasure and privilege of working with Morgamic:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m not sure I consistently hear more praise for any other manager  at Mozilla as I do about Morgamic. That includes me hearing myself talk about  how pleased I’ve been over the past two years to have him mentor me —  and our entire team. I feel pushed to do great work because of him, but  in a way unique to him and Fred (who I have to think he mentored  well, given their similar management styles) — constantly encouraged and  pushed but with amazing empathy and reason for pushing me. He also encouraged us all to get along with each other and all of Mozilla,  taken what seems to me as the sanest growth plan in Mozilla, and  strived to build an awesome team instead of just a big one. He  encouraged us to reach out and include “former” colleagues and constantly  bring potentials into the webdev world.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Mike Morgan brought me to Mozilla, a move I had always wanted and was appreciative of. It wasn’t until I had to opportunity to really work with Mike and see him in action that I realized how much of a compliment it was to have him seek me. Mike invests so much into each of his developers that they can’t help but strive for greatness to repay the favor. Morgamic fought hard for his developers and made sure they were working on something they were passionate about. I’m proud to have worked with and for Mike Morgan and I’m already jealous of the next set of developers he’ll lead. Mozilla wont be the same without him. Legend.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Like many of us on the web development team, I came to Mozilla through  Mike. I’ve worked closely with him for 7 years and watched him grow  from a volunteer developer into a well respected leader. I watched a  team of two turn into a team of fifty with his expertise and guidance.  He is magnetic - someone who naturally acts as a hub, of people, of  information, and of value. He strived to be a better leader, reading  books, studying role models, and speaking with experts about how to  encourage excellence on his team. People who have worked with him will  understand how short “he’ll be missed” falls - we’re all fortunate to  have worked with him for this long, and really, I guess we’ve been  greedy, it’s only fair to let the rest of the world have a chance too. “</em></li>
<li><em>“Even when we disagreed he trusted me. He could have ordered me to do  something else, or ordered my boss to order me. Instead he’d take me for  coffee and try to convince me of another way. Usually he succeeded, but  when he didn’t he would go out of his way to support my decision. Our  products were a byproduct of his relentless focus on the team — hiring  the right people and trusting them to make the right decisions.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Morgamic embodied Mozilla in so many ways. He was a continual positive influence in everything we did in WebDev, always believing in people and trying to get them to improve themselves. But he went far beyond the boundaries of the team and influenced so many others. His legacy at Mozilla will continue on from those lucky enough to have worked with him.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Soon after I switched from the Webdev team to the Engagement team,  Morgamic walked by the glass walls of a meeting room I was doing a video  conference in. He walked away, came back with a whiteboard marker, drew  a heart, and left.</em><em><br />
I’d follow that man to Hades.” </em></li>
<li><em>“He helped me feel good at Mozilla very quickly. I like how he can be totally not serious sometimes, but efficient when he needs to. He gathered an impressive team of wonderful, excellent, incredible Web  devs (except me, of course, but every team has its weakness <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.laurathomson.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> ). </em><em>We were the first interns to win the Annual Employees VS Interns Basketball match!”</em></li>
<li><em>“Morgamic exemplified Mozilla for me. Openness, transparency, and just plain fight-for-the-user awesomeness. Morgamic was one of the few managers I’ve had who was less my superior and more my facilitator. He often acted like a Mozilla concierge - ensuring I had what I needed, intervening where I was blocked, and making sure I was happy and headed in the right direction. I don’t think I ever disagreed with his strategic decisions, which often had included my input or had at least been communicated to me early & often. Not that my agreement is needed to run the company, but it at least felt like he always had my back and we were doing things the right way.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’ve known and worked with Mike for ten years. On meeting him, I knew immediately that I had met one of those rare personalities that one encounters only only a few times in life. I watched Mike mature over the years in both his personal and professional life. One Mozilla cantina night, I recall sitting with Shaver and, possibly, Schrep: the conversation was about finding good engineering management. I remember pointing across the room to Mike, who likely at that moment was doing something very silly/dangerous will alcohol and fire. ‘There is your man, promote from within and you’ll see amazing things from him.’ I think I nailed it.”<br />

</ul>
<p>The words “he will be missed” are so far from adequate it’s not even funny.</p>
<p>His legacy at Mozilla will live on, in the projects he built, in the  people he mentored, through every Open Source project that comes out  of Webdev, in the Mozilla mission, and in the hearts of all of us. I  can’t wait to see what he pulls off next - I’ll be watching, and so  should you, because I have no doubt it will be amazing. Remember, too,  that being a Mozillian isn’t something that stops just because you  change jobs. It’s more like what happens when your best friend moves  away. Nothing changes except the logistics.</p>
<p>As for the rest of us, we will miss him, but we will go on working for the Open Web as the better people he helped us to be.</p>
<p>On  his last day working at Mozilla, Morgamic said, “Webdev isn’t a job,  it’s a movement.” I’ll leave you with that, and with this video, that I  know he liked to watch over and over:<br />

<h3>Diversity beyond gender</h3>
<p>My first session of the day was about creating welcoming spaces that encourage all kinds of diversity, rather than only focusing on gender. Those present were very interested in physical space issues involving hacker/maker spaces or running events. We discussed a set of practices that have worked in several spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the people involved set the agenda and define the uses of a space.</li>
<li>Create an environment where a person of color is not the only person of color when they walk in.</li>
<li>Describe a space as a “makerspace” rather than a “hackerspace”.</li>
<li>Make events invite-only to establish a welcoming culture.</li>
<li>Don’t say “please come if you are a woman”. This is tokenizing language that discourages participation. </li>
<li>Invite everyone to organize events, not just attend events.</li>
<li>Invite people to events through existing, established groups.</li>
<li>Spend time thinking about who and what is missing from a group or space and take action to fix or change. </li>
</ul>
<p>Patterns of exclusion start long before we deal with them in technology culture.</p>
<h3>Being feminine in tech</h3>
<p>This was a very large group, so we attempted to focus discussion on some key issues. I was also reminded of “<a href=\"http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Grunch\">grunch</a>“, the feeling you get when you’ve suddenly been reminded that you’ve got a feminine body.</p>
<p>Our initial set of discussion topics were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Masculinity valued over femininity — how do we get to express a masculine identity in an authentic way and not devalue femininity? Are we expressing masculinity because it’s who we are or because we perceive it as having more value?</li>
<li>How “woman” can I be? do I have to switch to their language? what rules do I have follow?</li>
<li>How do I make suggestions for a more gender neutral culture in the workplace?</li>
<li>Peer shaming if you represent as highly feminine or androgynous</li>
<li>Reacting to the hyper masculine by occupying a more feminine place despite its authenticity</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants shared a series of stories about their experiences expressing feminine or masculine dress, haircut, physical attributes. Most of the descriptions were posed as experiments — “I spent a month wearing dresses to normalize femininity in my workplace and here’s what happened.” The experiments women are running on themselves and their coworkers to try to get people used to women in the workplace are fascinating and shocking. Reflecting on the discussion, I felt like we were back in pre-women’s suffrage, where men were shocked at women working or wanting equal rights.</p>
<p>I also realized that I think about issues with what I wear a lot, but rarely talk about it with my colleagues.</p>
<p>I learned about differentiating between a few different concepts when talking about expressing femininity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gender policing: comments designed to inform someone that they’re violating an accepted norm. Examples include being described as “dressing too slutty”, aggressive attention when a woman has a shaved head and looks masculine or androgynous. </li>
<li>Masculine assimilation: dressing more masculine to avoid unwanted attention</li>
<li>Feminine presentation seen as inviting sexual attention: several people described a dramatic change in behavior among colleagues or students when women wore traditionally feminine clothing (skirts, dresses, blouses)</li>
<li>Peer shaming: in this context, we discussed concerns with women who shame other women over appearing/acting too feminine, or using feminine symbols like the color pink.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was a lot more to this conversation. Looking back over the notes, I am a bit overwhelmed at how much ground we covered among so many people in just an hour. This session also led to some other hallway track conversations where I learned a bit more about how individuals are trying to balance their activism with their personal relationships with other women in open source/hardware/culture communities.</p>
<h3>Hardware hacking!</h3>
<p>I spent some time with the hardware hackers. Several women brought soft circuits, and one person brought a soldering station so that people could try out soldering for the first time. I was trying to get some IR LEDs integrated into a headband, and we had some issues with the shape and the stretchiness of our material. Other folks at the table were making blinking fuzzy muppet/monsters for their badges. Lots of very adorable blinky things were assembled.</p>
<p>I did demonstrate how to troubleshoot LEDs and what IR light looks like on digital cameras. I talked a bit more about medical devices with someone looking into how to hack her own augmentations. It felt a little like a “from the future” conversation. <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<h3>Mozilla contributor dinner</h3>
<p>I spent Sunday evening having dinner with some Mozilla contributors from France and a couple coworkers. I was probably the only person at the table who spoke only English, reminding me that I really aught to keep up on my language lessons. <img alt=\":D\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" /> </p>
<p>I caught my buddy Diane up on what had happened at AdaCamp, met Delphine’s husband and tried to convince some contributors to lead an effort to have an AdaCamp in Europe!</p>
<p>By the end of the evening, I was ready to collapse and get back to Portland!</p>
<h3>Summing up</h3>
<p>My last post about AdaCamp will be reflecting on all three of the camps – starting in Melbourne, Australia, then Washington, DC and finally in San Francisco. The event has grown from about 40 people to 200+, and for me, is the most exciting gathering of women in open source, open hardware and open culture. I’ve never been around so many women who share the same values, who are fighting for openness in technology and who are focused on tearing down the many barriers we face to involving more women in our technical communities.</p>" nil nil "fdf27d8b23083562e40ec219e8df1f21") (209 (20949 15560 730419) "http://www.glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?post/2013/06/24/BlueGriffon-and-%40media-print-stylesheets" "Daniel Glazman: BlueGriffon and '@media print' stylesheets" "glazou" "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 14:18:00 +0000" "<p>I'm still playing a lot with  (hear \"coding on\"...)

ads because of third party cookies, and in general about the lack
of privacy on the internets</p>
<p>I made the decision to not depend on a couple of big companies
anymore for all my data in the cloud and to pay for the services
I really needed & use the proper Firefox addons to cut down
on the ads.</p>
<p>I slowly moved away from Google.</p>
<p>I moved to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.newsblur.com/\">NewsBlur</a>
instead of Google Reader - before Reader was planned to be stopped.</p>
<p>I moved from Gmail to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://fastmail.fm\">fastmail.fm</a>. That was the
hardest one because I was on Gmail since 2004. Fastmail, it turns
out, has its servers in the U.S. too, but I guess having a
separate service for my e-mails is breaking the all-things-at-google
scheme. I am also trying to have my network use PGP when we exchange
e-mails, so they're stored encrypted on those servers I don't own.</p>
<p>Last, I moved from the Google search engine to DuckDuckGo, then
to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://startpage.com/\">StartPage</a>. The latter gives better
results than DuckDuckGo in general because it's a proxy on the
top of Google search engine. It just secures your privacy and
unlike DDG, you won't get <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/privacy\">Amazon referral links in your results</a>  I'd rather pay a yearly
rate at DDG rather than this referral system.</p>
<p>Anyways, I kept my Google account for two reasons: redirecting mails
to my fastmail account and using Google+ because I like this service
a lot. The redirection is not important anymore. After over a year of
redirection - people should know how to reach me :)</p>
<p>I also had Facebook to stay connected with my non-geek friends
mostly. I also use Twitter a lot.</p>
<p>However, the recent privacy scandals made me think a bit about
how I use all these services.</p>
<p>First of all, G+ and Facebook provide features to share <strong>privately</strong>
some data to a specific set of people. We've seen that our privacy
is not guaranteed. They'll give your data away if they're asked.</p>
<p>And well, they are commercial companies that need to sell ads,
so your private content is used anyways. Just look at the ads that
are displayed besides your e-mail when you use GMail.</p>
<p>So while there's an incentive to let you share data thinking
it's not public, shit happens. So I don't see the point of pushing
anything non-public in those silos. And it turns out that I am mostly
a consumer. Too bad G+ is a private club and you can't see its
content if you don't have a Google account.</p>
<p>If I have cool stuff to talk about, I can blog and probably
do a better job in one blog post than in numerous G+ or FB posts.</p>
<p>Twitter on the other hand, is mostly shouting out in public your
opinions, promoting your projects. I barely use the DM feature.</p>
<p>Twitter is not different of course from Google & Facebook - they
need to sell ads and your data is used for this, but at least it's
easier to control that you're only pushing public stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Given all of this, I have deleted my Google and Facebook accounts yesterday</strong></p>
<p>(well, for FB unfortunately I reactivated it today because I lost
access to my Spotify Premium account - so until this is solved, my FB
is still active but it's a matter of days.)</p>
<p>All of this if of course is the tip of the iceberg since we eventually
found out that governments can just extract content from the flow that
goes through undersea cables.</p>
<p>But what I am doing is still important. It's a political act that will
shape the future if we're a bunch of people acting like this.
We need to show through our online habits and actions that we care about
our privacy.</p>
<p>On the phone side, I guess I am in a pretty good shape since I use Firefox OS.
The only part that worries me now is the hardware.</p>
<p>Now my next task is to teach my kids how important privacy is, so that they
clearly understand what's going on when they are using the internets.</p>" nil nil "5099ee134dd0f560414db6b456594cd7") (207 (20949 15560 726227) "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BenjaminKerensaDotComMozilla/~3/B7HPR4BygTU/30-days-of-xubuntu" "Benjamin Kerensa: Xubuntu 30-Day Challenge" "Benjamin Kerensa" "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 02:01:59 +0000" "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"thickbox no_icon\" href=\"http://cdn.benjaminkerensa.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-06232013-061843-PM.png\" title=\"Screenshot 06232013 061843 PM 300x168 Xubuntu 30 Day Challenge\"><img alt=\"Screenshot 06232013 061843 PM 300x168 Xubuntu 30 Day Challenge\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1945 aligncenter\" height=\"168\" src=\"http://cdn.benjaminkerensa.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-06232013-061843-PM-300x168.png\" title=\"Xubuntu 30 Day Challenge\" width=\"300\" /></a>As a result of my growing concern over privacy and for other purposes, I decided I would take up a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html\" target=\"_blank\">30-day challenge.</a> Yeah…like the one that Matt Cutts gave a TED Talk about. I would switch to a Community Flavor and see how it worked and see if I could keep it as my desktop instead of Ubuntu.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The requirements I had for desktop challenge:</p>
<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">
<li>Must be Ubuntu Community Flavor</li>
<li>Firefox shipped as default browser</li>
<li>Preference to lighter weight DE</li>
<li>Solid Support and Dev Sub-Community</li>
<li>Must respect <a href=\"http://blog.sidstamm.com/2012/12/what-is-privacy.html\" target=\"_blank\">privacy</a></li>
</ul>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The conclusion for me based on those requirements was that Xubuntu was the best candidate for my 30-day challenge although I did consider Kubuntu. But their lack of shipping Firefox as a default was a deal breaker for me even though they still have an equally crisp desktop.</p>

a week, to start a new job at Mozilla.</p>
<p>That was a huge change in my life since I had to interact daily with people
in English, cope with the 9 hours timezone and try to keep up the pace of
working with smarter people than me (I am still the dumbest.)</p>
<p>I was the only guy in Europe in the Services team, and had to wait until
7pm to actually chat with my colleagues and exchange info. I had numerous
late nights of work the first year.</p>
<p>But it was worthing the pain: I was the first Python guy in the Services
team and worked to convert the Firefox Sync server to a \"state of the art\"
Python application, along with all the ecosystem around it.</p>
<p>A big challenge I was quite proud of taking. I was trusted to do the
right things and helped the team moving off the PHP version.</p>
<p>The Python launch did not go well because of a bug we could not really
have avoided, and I had a few sleepless nights and nightmares before
everything went back to normal. Eventually, the Python version worked
very well and the next apps were built using the same tools & recipes.</p>
<p>The team grew and more Python folks joined later on. I've learned a lot
during that time and looking back, those stressful weeks were the
best times I had.</p>
<p>Since that first year, a lot of things have changed at Mozilla:
Alexis joined the team and I slowly went back to a normal schedule
since we've managed to start a 'Europe team' and work together.</p>
<p>The new Paris office opened a few months ago and you can feel
that the Europe side of Mozilla is growing big time.</p>
<p>I don't feel like a remote guy away from his office anymore
so that's great :)</p>
<p>These days I am doing a lot of work in building tools for
server-side developers. I should include qa and devops as well.</p>
<p>Namely: Circus, Vaurien, Loads & Cornice.</p>
<p>I love what I am doing and I think those tools are useful
outside our team itself.</p>
<p>Circus & Cornice are starting to get patches from outside
Mozilla so that's great.</p>
<p>Last but not least: Everytime a privacy or a patent scandal
occurs, I am proud that my thoughts & opinions are exactly
the ones that are defended and echoed by Mozilla voices.

One variant that has applications far beyond initial import is contact sharing via Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
It would be great if I could send contacts back and forth between all my devices, including the Firefox OS ones. Other phones usually can send and receive contacts in VCard (.vcf) format via Bluetooth, but Firefox OS so far is missing this functionality (even though some VCard support exists for import from SD card in 1.1, though I could never get that to work for me).<br />
<br />
A reasonably usable implementation for sharing could be implemented as an app: It would need to read from the Contacts API, present a selection to the user, assemble VCard files and send those off via a Web Activity so the existing Bluetooth sharing can act on them. With that, the sending side should work.<br />
The receiving side would be a bit more hacky, but also doable: Unfortunately, the existing Bluetooth support does not call a Web Activity for handling not explicitely supported file types, it only ends up saving them on the SD card. So the contact sharing app would need to periodically look for new VCard files in that location, read and offer to import them, and finally use the Contacts API again to write them into the system's database.<br />
<br />
If someone would pick up the needed work there, I'm sure the app would be quite popular, and I'd love to use it myself. Ultimately, I think this functionality should be part of the official Contacts apps, so having any such app available under a licence that allows Gaia to use the code would be great. Still, I think it would be awesome to have the app so the soon-shipping Firefox-OS-1.0.1-powered devices can use them.<br />

I live it, I breathe it, I was there when it became available to a larger audience at an affordable rate and I have seen it grow more and more to the most interesting, versatile and easiest to participate media out there. I’ve witnessed the power it gives to people who have no voice in traditional media and give people education where their social standing or school system would not support them.</p>
<p>This is why it hurts me to see people squander the opportunity that is the web away by clogging it with short-lived, let’s say it – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE0CRMm59BY\">bullshit</a>. Sure, this is a natural thing – the web is a normal part of our lives and the new generation of users is web-native, meaning they don’t know any longer what it would be like to be offline. When we stop seeing something as hard to get it becomes a commodity and we value it less. Didn’t have to fight for it, so why see it as something I should care for? It is always there, isn’t it? Much like we waste drinking water until we lived in a country where you couldn’t drink from the tap.</p>
<p><img alt=\"didn't read, LOL - apparently something to be proud of…\" src=\"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/198/460/iwkoqt.gif\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>The time when we listened to random beeping sounds from our modems and got excited when we got a full 56KB connection for a change are over. Mobile connectivity is still a problem, and sometimes gets expensive but even then the connection speeds are great. That is when you are in the country where your mobile contract and in “first world” countries. Get out of this world and you still feel the flakiness of connectivity and you get much more grateful for information becoming available after the third exasperated reload of the current web page.</p>
<p>And this is where I get very disappointed when I see that we are moving into a world where people stop using text and words to describe their feelings, ideas and plans and – well, <em>communicate</em> with others. Instead we are confronted with an avalanche of images, memes, animated GIFs of several megabytes and age-old fake conversations, jokes and “inspirational quotes” as badly optimised JPGs full of artifacts. We also get a lot of messages that could be a short post in the form of a video with terrible lighting and bad audio. They are easy to make, but they are much harder to consume. I can skim a long text until it gets interesting. I can not do that with a video unless I have a timed transcript.</p>
<p>I am not even going to start on the accessibility issues that come from a web that consists solely of images and videos. I am talking about incredibly useful technology and systems that are available to us as a result of a just a bit more than a decade of web evolution becoming useless.</p>
<p>Search engines like text. You will get your productions on the web found by having good text in there. Your images and videos can be as amazing as they come – if there is no descriptive text all you get is traffic coming from people seeing your things and sharing them. This can be incredibly powerful – something “going viral” can get you a lot of hits and shares in a very short amount of time and give you the false impression that you are a success and made an impact on the web. But the success is fleeting and a few minutes later the next cool thing will come around. A day later other people will share your work as theirs and again get a quick fix of fame. It is turning the web into a pure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber\">Operant Conditioning Chamber</a>, the same phenomenon that powers casual online gaming and makes people give up on privacy, as explained eloquently by <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxObserver-Cory-Doctorow\">Cory Doctorow in his TEDxObserver talk</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, social sharing also has great benefits beyond the quick fame. People describing your work in their words when sharing can add different language explanations or give your content more impact as an important voice people trust tweeted about it, but it relies on the good-will of people consuming what you produce and making the effort to share it or write words around it. If you provided the words from the beginning, you’ll get this as extra on top of people who will find your work using search engines – because you used text. And even better, if someone gets to your product and doesn’t speak your language, they can use a free translation service to get the product in at least an approximation of their language. We can use web technology to make products more accessible to us without having to rely on a social interaction of someone capable of both languages to do the work for us.</p>
<p>Above all, what bugs me is that the flood of memes, animated GIFs and videos and their quick, false fame robs new users of the web of the opportunity to learn how to speed-read, write and – above all – communicate in writing. I learned English in a few ways. First of all, in school, which works well if your teacher is not a non-native English speaker just trying to get through the curriculum. Secondly, I watched English TV series (Monty Python, as this was the only non-dubbed show) with subtitles. This taught me to understand English and thus – subconsciously – how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>A large part of me learning other languages though was through text communication with people from other countries. First on notes sent on floppy disks in the mail trading demos and tools, then on BBSes and then on the web. Reading and writing comments, hanging out on <span class=\"caps\">IRC</span> and having many a fight and a lot of brainstorming there, taking part in forums and mailing lists, newsgroups and finally in social networks like Facebook and Google+. I could talk to someone on the other side of the globe, in real time, and it didn’t take ages to get a video or suffered from bad audio on a phone call or voice call.</p>
<p>It baffles me to see that we have a world-wide communication network with a very low barrier to entry and nearly no expense on publishing and we don’t use it to better ourselves, to make us better communicators. Instead we complain that governments don’t do enough to make school education better. Today you don’t need to buy a book in another language and wait for it in the mail. You can get it online and read it in Kindle, Google Play books, or even go to <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/‎\">Project Gutenberg</a> and read them for free.

<p>Words are powerful, they spark a theatre in the head. People reading your words make their own pictures at a speed pictures could never be transmitted. Instead of giving one image you create a gallery, one that you will never see, but your readers do. And this gallery is very personal to them and thus gets remembered much more. Of course words can cause controversy, misunderstandings and can hurt.

<p>The old saying that a picture says a thousand words is true when it comes to explanations. Re-hashing memes and jumping on bandwagons based on current pop culture references that will be impossible to grasp a month later doesn’t say a thousand words.

<p>Please, use your words. Turn on that grammar check, re-read that tweet before you send it. Write a short sentence instead of posting a meme we’ve seen thousands of times before. And don’t get discouraged when people don’t jump on it and thank you or go nuts about it. This is not for fame, this is for you. If all technology fails, words and gestures is what we have. You can exercise and train your brain to paint with words, to create gorgeous constructs. You get better the more you push yourself to not be lazy and use the obvious word but one that is more specific. Words are beautiful.

the mail, but hadn't had a chance to open the package until today
(crazy life stuff).</p>
<p>I'm running Debian Testing and had done some Gaia/FirefoxOS work in
late 2012. I had my development environment still set up including adb
and fastboot.</p>
<p>I wanted to switch the phone to the nightly channel which is what I
was using (or thought I was using) with my Unagi. Mostly I followed
<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/06/updating-and-tweaking-your-firefox-os-developer-preview-phonegeeksphone/\">Updating and Tweaking your Firefox OS Developer Preview
phone/Geeksphone</a>.</p>
<p>After doing that, I moved my SIM card over as well as the Micro SD
card I had in my Unagi phone. The Micro SD card has all my media on
it---not my suer data. I thought about moving my user data over, but
I've had the Unagi so long that I figured my user data is probably in
a funky state anyhow and better to start over.</p>
<p>Couple of thoughts:</p>
<ol class=\"arabic simple\">
<li>The nightly build is version 2.0.0-prerelease.</li>
<li>The phone is a lot bigger than the Unagi---it'll take a bit of
getting used to.</li>
<li>Most things worked fine. I even got a marketing message from
T-Mobile minutes after I inserted my SIM card and got on the
network.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few issues (the camera is not working at all). I need to
spend some time with Bugzilla to file those with useful
data. Regardless, the phone is working pretty well and I'm probably
going to switch to it as my primary phone soon. That might give me
some incentive to finish rewriting <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://willkg.github.io/magic10ball/\">magic10ball</a>.</p>

I worked with the system, I helped developers port their apps to it and I spend hours and hours writing about it, making demos and talking to the press and anyone who’d stand still long enough (or sit on a plane next to me). Today I got my reward with the FirefoxOS movement going from “Idea” via “Prototype” to “Developer Preview” and now “Launch”.</p>
<p>As announced today on the Mozilla blog <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/press/2013/07/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">Mozilla and Partners Prepare to Launch First Firefox <span class=\"caps\">OS </span>Smartphones</a> and by prepare this means adding the shiny bow to the boxes containing phones that end users will be able to buy.</p>
<p>According to the <a href=\"http://pressoffice.telefonica.com/jsp/base.jsp?contenido=/jsp/notasdeprensa/notadetalle.jsp&id=0&origen=portada&idm=eng&pais=1&elem=20030\">Telefonica blog announcement</a> this will be very soon indeed and the offer is pretty amazing:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Movistar to offer the <span class=\"caps\">ZTE </span>Open for €69, including €30 of balance for prepaid customers and a 4GB microSD card.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Not only is the price very competitive, you <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu8q-oISbas\">get a great phone for that</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve said this many times before, but let me now here repeat the things that really get me excited like a 5 year old on sugar rush about Firefox OS:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Firefox OS kills the idea of mobile web connectivity only being for the rich in the western world.</strong> Yes, for us in the US or the UK having a new shiny phone every half year is not an issue as companies are killing each other trying to underbid the price and offers of the others. But a usable Android that is not generations behind and hard-wired to a terrible stock browser or an iPhone is just not affordable to everyone. Even worse, if you have no credit card you couldn’t even buy apps for them. This is unfair, elitist and plainly against anything the web stands for. FirefoxOS is affordable, and apps can be bought on prepay or on your phone bill and the OS is the browser which means updates are easy</li><li><strong>FirefoxOS does not assume a fast, stable and always available connection</strong>. When traveling I start hating my Android phone which I love to bits otherwise. Having dozens of megabyte updates over roaming is out of the question and neither is using flaky and slow wireless connections. Firefox OS has no native apps – all of them, including the system apps are written in <span class=\"caps\">HTML</span>, CSS and JavaScript. Thus they are much smaller and can have atomic updates instead of having to be replaced as a unit every single time.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS is the web in your pocket.</strong> It is Firefox and nothing else (other than a Linux core to access the hardware). Thus I will not be told to “download the native app” when I go to web sites that are perfectly fine to use.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS is the platform <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> deserves</strong> For developers, our <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> solutions are finally first-class citizens. We are not shoved into a slower web view and told we can not access the hardware.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS apps are web distributed apps.</strong> Users can go to the marketplace and find our apps by hand or via review or they could search for a certain song, movie, football team and dish and find our app that way. App discovery is as simple as using the web and finding web sites. Instead of having to pay as a developer and be at the mercy of the T&C of closed marketplaces I can publish a Firefox OS app by adding a button and calling the open web apps <span class=\"caps\">API</span>. That way my current web site is the ad for my app and all my visitors potential app users.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>All of this is obvious to me as a geek but doesn’t mean anything if we don’t get devices in the hands of end users. And this is what happens now – big time! Alcatel, <span class=\"caps\">ZTE</span>, Telefonica, Deutsche Telekom, Spain and Poland. The fox really is out of the bag now. And oh how it will roam and run into many other directions. Be part of this, as a web developer, it is the most rewarding platform that will not change from under you at the whim of company goals or shareholder demands.</p>" nil nil "1d503f0389fc9633d737b1f89352ff97") (199 (20949 12153 318023) "http://christianheilmann.com/2013/06/29/in-praise-of-intelligent-paper-maps-map%c2%b2-on-kickstarter/" "Christian Heilmann: In praise of intelligent paper maps =?utf-8?B?4oCTIG1hcMKy?= on Kickstarter" "Chris Heilmann" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 23:52:58 +0000" "<p>I am currently in Barcelona, a gorgeous but quite confusing town. Once again, I am getting the distinct feeling that we are becoming the slaves of the usefulness of our technologies as I find myself checking my phone for the map and places to go just to realise that I am not on roaming data and can not use either. So I get the worst experience:</p>
<p></p><ul><li>I am in a city notoriously known for its pickpockets</li><li>I show a very expensive smart phone (or very scarce Geeksphone) while I am walking down the road</li><li>I can not move around the map as Google Maps doesn’t allow me to cache the tiles here</li></ul><p></p>
<p>Of course the hotel offers free maps which are huge and very much pinpoint me as a tourist and potential target. They also cover the whole city and don’t allow me to zoom into a level that I need. Which brings me to a great product a friend of mine created and <a href=\"http://christianheilmann.com/2007/03/20/zoomable-map-solution-on-paper/\">I wrote about before</a>: <a href=\"http://www.thezoomablemap.com/\">map² the intelligent map on paper</a>.</p>

<p>map² is a paper map that solves the above issue. It is small, fits in your hand and allows you to zoom into the area you need:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So far the map is only available for Berlin and London, but here is the good news: Anne, the designer of the map started <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/423153152/map2-the-zoomable-map-on-paper\">a kickstarter campaign to create the map as a city series</a>. If she reaches the £20,000 goal she’ll create a similar map for New York with others to follow.

I live it, I breathe it, I was there when it became available to a larger audience at an affordable rate and I have seen it grow more and more to the most interesting, versatile and easiest to participate media out there. I’ve witnessed the power it gives to people who have no voice in traditional media and give people education where their social standing or school system would not support them.</p>
<p>This is why it hurts me to see people squander the opportunity that is the web away by clogging it with short-lived, let’s say it – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE0CRMm59BY\">bullshit</a>. Sure, this is a natural thing – the web is a normal part of our lives and the new generation of users is web-native, meaning they don’t know any longer what it would be like to be offline. When we stop seeing something as hard to get it becomes a commodity and we value it less. Didn’t have to fight for it, so why see it as something I should care for? It is always there, isn’t it? Much like we waste drinking water until we lived in a country where you couldn’t drink from the tap.</p>
<p><img alt=\"didn't read, LOL - apparently something to be proud of…\" src=\"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/198/460/iwkoqt.gif\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>The time when we listened to random beeping sounds from our modems and got excited when we got a full 56KB connection for a change are over. Mobile connectivity is still a problem, and sometimes gets expensive but even then the connection speeds are great. That is when you are in the country where your mobile contract and in “first world” countries. Get out of this world and you still feel the flakiness of connectivity and you get much more grateful for information becoming available after the third exasperated reload of the current web page.</p>
<p>And this is where I get very disappointed when I see that we are moving into a world where people stop using text and words to describe their feelings, ideas and plans and – well, <em>communicate</em> with others. Instead we are confronted with an avalanche of images, memes, animated GIFs of several megabytes and age-old fake conversations, jokes and “inspirational quotes” as badly optimised JPGs full of artifacts. We also get a lot of messages that could be a short post in the form of a video with terrible lighting and bad audio. They are easy to make, but they are much harder to consume. I can skim a long text until it gets interesting. I can not do that with a video unless I have a timed transcript.</p>
<p>I am not even going to start on the accessibility issues that come from a web that consists solely of images and videos. I am talking about incredibly useful technology and systems that are available to us as a result of a just a bit more than a decade of web evolution becoming useless.</p>
<p>Search engines like text. You will get your productions on the web found by having good text in there. Your images and videos can be as amazing as they come – if there is no descriptive text all you get is traffic coming from people seeing your things and sharing them. This can be incredibly powerful – something “going viral” can get you a lot of hits and shares in a very short amount of time and give you the false impression that you are a success and made an impact on the web. But the success is fleeting and a few minutes later the next cool thing will come around. A day later other people will share your work as theirs and again get a quick fix of fame. It is turning the web into a pure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber\">Operant Conditioning Chamber</a>, the same phenomenon that powers casual online gaming and makes people give up on privacy, as explained eloquently by <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxObserver-Cory-Doctorow\">Cory Doctorow in his TEDxObserver talk</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, social sharing also has great benefits beyond the quick fame. People describing your work in their words when sharing can add different language explanations or give your content more impact as an important voice people trust tweeted about it, but it relies on the good-will of people consuming what you produce and making the effort to share it or write words around it. If you provided the words from the beginning, you’ll get this as extra on top of people who will find your work using search engines – because you used text. And even better, if someone gets to your product and doesn’t speak your language, they can use a free translation service to get the product in at least an approximation of their language. We can use web technology to make products more accessible to us without having to rely on a social interaction of someone capable of both languages to do the work for us.</p>
<p>Above all, what bugs me is that the flood of memes, animated GIFs and videos and their quick, false fame robs new users of the web of the opportunity to learn how to speed-read, write and – above all – communicate in writing. I learned English in a few ways. First of all, in school, which works well if your teacher is not a non-native English speaker just trying to get through the curriculum. Secondly, I watched English TV series (Monty Python, as this was the only non-dubbed show) with subtitles. This taught me to understand English and thus – subconsciously – how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>A large part of me learning other languages though was through text communication with people from other countries. First on notes sent on floppy disks in the mail trading demos and tools, then on BBSes and then on the web. Reading and writing comments, hanging out on <span class=\"caps\">IRC</span> and having many a fight and a lot of brainstorming there, taking part in forums and mailing lists, newsgroups and finally in social networks like Facebook and Google+. I could talk to someone on the other side of the globe, in real time, and it didn’t take ages to get a video or suffered from bad audio on a phone call or voice call.</p>
<p>It baffles me to see that we have a world-wide communication network with a very low barrier to entry and nearly no expense on publishing and we don’t use it to better ourselves, to make us better communicators. Instead we complain that governments don’t do enough to make school education better. Today you don’t need to buy a book in another language and wait for it in the mail. You can get it online and read it in Kindle, Google Play books, or even go to <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/‎\">Project Gutenberg</a> and read them for free. And yet people using proper grammar on the web are congratulated for it or – more commonly – made fun of. A higher level of education should not be a surprise in a world that has access to the largest library ever. It should be a given.</p>
<p>Words are powerful, they spark a theatre in the head. People reading your words make their own pictures at a speed pictures could never be transmitted. Instead of giving one image you create a gallery, one that you will never see, but your readers do. And this gallery is very personal to them and thus gets remembered much more. Of course words can cause controversy, misunderstandings and can hurt. But even then they can spark a conversation and make you realise the effect of your actions much more than a “like” or an “upvote” could ever do.</p>
<p>The old saying that a picture says a thousand words is true when it comes to explanations. Re-hashing memes and jumping on bandwagons based on current pop culture references that will be impossible to grasp a month later doesn’t say a thousand words. It basically says “I am lazy, here is a quick laugh to hint at my creativity”. We are blessed to be able to transmit our thoughts to an audience we will never be able to meet physically. We should not squander this.</p>
<p>Please, use your words. Turn on that grammar check, re-read that tweet before you send it. Write a short sentence instead of posting a meme we’ve seen thousands of times before. And don’t get discouraged when people don’t jump on it and thank you or go nuts about it. This is not for fame, this is for you. If all technology fails, words and gestures is what we have.

<p>I’ve been using Alembic, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration\">database schema migration</a> tool, for about three months now, and really liking it a lot. I created a blog post that served as a slide deck for an internal team called <a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2013/05/17/migrations-with-alembic-a-lightspeed-tour/\">A lightspeed tour of Alembic</a> as my first stab at user education.</p>
<p>Setting things up initially was pretty simple, but explaining it to a coworker after I’d set everything up for myself proved slightly more difficult. Below are my notes on the differences between <a href=\"http://alembic.readthedocs.org\">Alembic</a> and some other migration tool.</p>
<h4>Terminology</h4>
<p>Alembic calls each migration a <em>revision</em>. Revisions know what order to be run in because each revision is given a <code>down_revision</code> to identify its parent. If <code>down_revision</code> is <code>None</code>, that revision is the very first revision according to Alembic. You can put your whole schema in that revision, or you can just start adding changes to this initial revision. Alembic doesn’t complain either way.</p>
<p>A best practice would likely be putting your entire model into the first revision. I may go back and “fix” this for us later. I opted to just have the default use case be to create a database fresh with a tool we call <code>setupdb_app.py</code>.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to migrate to using alembic, you’ll also need to use SQLAlchemy. I used sqlautocode for my initial schema <a href=\"http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/schema.html#reflecting-database-objects\">reflection</a>, and there’s a new tool <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/agronholm/sqlacodegen/src\">sqlacodegen</a> you may want to check out for generating your SQLAlchemy models for the first time.</p>
<h4>Preparation: edit config and activate a virtualenv</h4>
<p>Our environment was set up per the <a href=\"https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#creating-an-environment\">alembic tutorial for creating an environment</a>. I ran:</p>
<p><code>alembic init alembic</code></p>
<p>I also put an <code>alembic.ini-dist</code> file into our project’s <code>config/</code> directory, and modified <code>alembic/env.py</code> to include our model.</p>
<p>To get started working with an existing install, you’ll need to modify <code>alembic.ini-dist</code>, and copy it to <code>config/alembic.ini</code> to fit your environment – setting the connection string and the path to the alembic directory are the two most important settings. We have a script which creates databases from our <code>models.py</code> called <code>setupdb_app.py</code>. This script takes <code>--database_name</code> as a command-line argument. My default for our project is to use <code>breakpad</code>.</p>
<p>We use a <code>virtualenv</code> called <code>socorro-virtualenv</code>. The virtualenv is created automatically if you run <code>make test</code>. If you’re creating a standalone virtualenv, you can do that with <code>virtualenv socorro-virtualenv</code>. Activate this with <code>. socorro-virtualenv/bin/activate</code>.</p>
<h3>Creating a revision</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a fresh database to work from. For Socorro, the command is: <code>PYTHONPATH=. socorro/external/postgresql/setupdb_app.py --database_name=breakpad</code></li>
<li>Edit <code>models.py</code> with the change to the schema</li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini revision -m 'your message about the migration'</code>. The output will include the name of the new file.</li>
<li>Edit that file as needed <code>alembic/versions/*.py</code></li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini upgrade +1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>If all goes well, your revision is ready! If something goes wrong, edit and try again. The revision will automatically rollback if there are any errors.</p>
<h3>Production deployment</h3>
<p>You’ll need to deploy an <code>alembic.ini</code> on your production database system and probably a <code>virtualenv</code> to support your python modules.</p>
<p>We deploy our virtualenvs with our application, so this step was pretty simple for everything except for alembic itself. The virtualenv put in full, static paths for the python binaries and had some dependencies that I haven’t figured out yet for actually running alembic. To get around this, I created a virualenv locally on the system for the <em>postgres</em> user. Having your postgres user run the migrations locally is a must for me because I need to access the filesystem to pull in new versions of user defined functions stashed in the directory my model lives in.</p>
<p>I just deploy a new release of our application code on the database server locally, and then I run alembic against the <code>versions</code> directory that’s deployed.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>And here’s an FAQ for the common problems folks ran into:</p>
<h4>OOPS I forgot to create a database before I created a revision!</h4>
<p>To “fix” this, try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the database from scratch using your current <code>models.py</code>.</li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini downgrade -1</code></li>
<li>Run: <code>PYTHONPATH=. alembic -c config/alembic.ini upgrade +1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming your downgrade function works, this should allow you reverse the latest revision and then test your migration.</p>
<h4>Error message: “Only a single head supported so far.”</h4>
<p>See <a href=\"https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#working-with-branches\">Working with Branches</a>.</p>
<h4>I’m using schemas, and alembic doesn’t recognize them when I try to use <code>--autogenerate</code>.</h4>
<p>See <a href=\"http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html?highlight=include_symbol\">include_symbol</a>. And be sure to add this to both the “offline” and “online” versions of the revision code in <code>env.py</code>.</p>
<h4>Error message: Target database is not up to date.</h4>
<p>This means you’ve got a file in your <code>versions</code> directory that contains one or more migrations that haven’t been applied to the current database. You can either apply them with <code>alembic upgrade head</code> or have a look in that directory and remove the migration(s) that you don’t want.</p>" nil nil "620b9c095cdbb586630001d8b9271a72") (195 (20948 18141 789648) "http://irinasandu.com/2013/07/03/firefox-os-the-job-to-be-done/" "Irina Sandu: Firefox OS =?utf-8?Q?=E2=80=93?= the job to be done" "Irina Sandu" "Wed, 03 Jul 2013 15:09:08 +0000" "<p><a href=\"http://irinas.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/screen-shot-2013-07-02-at-11-34-39-pm.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-07-02 at 11.34.39 PM\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-659\" height=\"266\" src=\"http://irinas.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/screen-shot-2013-07-02-at-11-34-39-pm.png?w=487&h=266\" width=\"487\" /></a></p>

<h4><strong>Firefox OS doesn’t reach the user by itself</strong></h4>
<p>One important difference that we’ve had to adapt to to develop Firefox OS is that before it reaches the user, an operating system needs to integrate with other parts, created by other organizations. Unlike the browser, the operating system is not something that we give to users by itself. It is only one layer that goes into a mobile phone and it is important that it connects and collaborates with the other parts that make up a phone experience.</p>
<p>That meant that when we thought about the features and functions that we would like to build in a device there were a lot that we had not a lot of influence over, because we were not creating them. Before we could start thinking about where Firefox OS could excel at, we needed to separate its function within a phone and the mobile ecosystem from that of the other players. In other words, we needed to know what is <strong>the job to be done of Firefox OS</strong>.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>There are 5 layers in the mobile ecosystem</strong></h4>
<p>To do this we started breaking down the elements of the mobile ecosystem and define what are the different parts that interact with each other, what is their function and what type of organizations are producing them.</p>
<p>To do this, we looked at what are the steps that content needs to go through from when it’s created by the developer to when it is consumed by the user. A day in the life of content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information is created and stored on servers by <strong>developers</strong> in form of <strong>content</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bytes need to be <strong>transported</strong> to their destination, a job assigned to the <strong>network equipment providers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As a copy of the information leaves the server, it needs to know to which destination to go. It is important that the content is returned to the person who actually asked for it, not to a random one or to the whole network. This job is done by the <strong>network operator</strong>, by means of the IP address, whose key role is that of <strong>authentication</strong> for the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Once it has reached the user, the information still needs to be <strong>processed</strong> on to a screen by a device, which is made by <strong>hardware manufacturers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After it is stored on the hardware, the information is organized and <strong>consumed</strong> by the user through the means of the a <strong>user agent</strong>, which is the operating system. This is where Firefox OS comes in.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h4><strong>Firefox OS is the interface and the data manager for the user</strong></h4>
<p>A user agent is the protective layer between the user and the rest of the ecosystem. It needs to represent the intentions and actions of the end – consumer to the rest of the layers that make up a phone, it needs to translate what is happening at the byte level to the user and in the same time protect against unauthorized access to other data stored on the device.</p>
<p>The <strong>job to be done</strong> of Firefox OS is not one, but several:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is the interface for the user to the entire mobile ecosystem</li>
<li>it represents the user when she wants to interact with the other layers of the phone</li>
<li>it organizes the user’s data</li>
<li>it surfaces the signals sent by the other parts of the phone</li>
<li>it protects the user’s data from unauthorized access</li>
</ul>

<p>In this post I shall use the Tower of Babel in a somewhat more relevant and specific way: It will speak about multilingualism and about Babel itself.</p>
<p>This is how most people saw the Wikipedia article about the Tower of Babel until today:</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2183\" style=\"width: 461px;\"><a href=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-tofu1.png\"><img alt=\"The Tower of Babel article.

Notice the pointless squares in the Akkadian name. They are called “tofu” in the jargon on internationalization programmers.</p></div>
<p>And this is how most people will see it from today:</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2184\" style=\"width: 479px;\"><a href=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-cuneiform.png\"><img alt=\"And we have the name written in real Akkadian cuneiform!\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2184\" src=\"http://aharoni.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/babel-cuneiform.png?w=500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">And we have the name written in real Akkadian cuneiform!</p></div>
<p>Notice how the Akkadian name now appears as actual Akkadian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform\">cuneiform</a>, and not as meaningless squares. Even if you, like most people, cannot actually read cuneiform, you probably understand that showing it this way is more correct, useful and educational.</p>
<p>This is possible thanks to the webfonts technology, which was enabled on the English Wikipedia today. It was already enabled in Wikipedias in some languages for many months, mostly in languages of India, which have severe problems with font support in the common operating systems, but now it’s available in the English Wikipedia, where it mostly serves to show parts of text that are written in exotic fonts.</p>
<p>The current iteration of the webfonts support in Wikipedia is part of a larger project: the Universal Language Selector (ULS). I am very proud to be one of its developers. My team in Wikimedia developed it over the last year or so, during which it underwent a rigorous process of design, testing with dozens of users from different countries, development, bug fixing and deployment. In addition to webfonts it provides an easy way to pick the user interface language, and to type in non-English languages (the latter feature is disabled by default in the English Wikipedia; to enable it, click the cog icon near “Languages” in the sidebar, then click “Input” and “Enable input tools”). In the future it will provide even more abilities, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>If you edit Wikipedia, or want to try editing it, one way in which you could help with the deployment of webfonts would be to make sure that all foreign strings in Wikipedia are marked with the appropriate HTML lang attribute; for example, that every Vietnamese string is marked as <span lang=”vi” dir=”ltr”>. This will help the software apply the webfonts correctly, and in the future it will also help spelling and hyphenation software, etc.</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be possible without the help of many, many people. The developers of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Opera, who developed the support for webfonts in these browsers; The people in Wikimedia who designed and developed the ULS: Alolita Sharma, Arun Ganesh, Brandon Harris, Niklas Laxström, Pau Giner, Santhosh Thottingal and Siebrand Mazeland; The many volunteers who tested ULS and reported useful bugs; The people in Unicode, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Everson\">Michael Everson</a>, who work hard to give a number to every letter in every imaginable alphabet and make massive online multilingualism possible; And last but not least, the talented and generous people who developed all those fonts for the different scripts and released them under Free licenses. I send you all my deep appreciation, as a developer and as a reader of Wikipedia.</p>

Much of the work was done in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=655877\" title=\"Bug 655877 – SVG text should use CSS text frames to gain support for various text layout features\">bug 655877</a>, which ended up being a series of 50 patches<sup>(!)</sup>, with about 40 followup bugs to get the code into shape so that it could be turned on by default.</p>
<p>Improvements resulting from this work include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration\">text-decoration</a>’ property is now honoured, so underlines, strike-throughs and overlines are painted.</li>
<li>Searching for text on a page will now search through and highlight SVG text.</li>
<li>Text can be selected with the mouse.</li>
<li>Layout of bidirectional text when there are multiple child nodes of a <code><text></code> element is now correct.</li>
<li>The ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space\">white-space</a>’ property now applies to SVG text.  In the future, in SVG 2, ‘white-space’ will be recommended method to control white space handling rather than <code>xml:space=\"\"</code>.  ‘white-space’ can be used to render manually wrapped text when using the <code>pre</code> and <code>pre-line</code> values.  ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height\">line-height</a>’ is used to determine the spacing between lines.</li>
<li>Various <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-fonts/\">CSS3 Font properties</a>, including the new ‘font-variant’ related properties to turn on and off OpenType features, now apply to SVG text.</li>
<li>The <code>:first-letter</code> and <code>:first-line</code> pseudo-elements now apply to SVG text.</li>

I had recently joined Mozilla, and about one or two months in, a wiki page surfaced. It was called <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2g\">B2G</a>.</p>
<h3>The beginning</h3>
<p>B2G stod for Boot to Gecko, a name implying that you would boot into Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, and a codename that stuck around for about a year. Apparently it was about building a mobile operating system based on, and targeted at, the Open Web. The wiki page took most of us by surprise, including our Press  and Evangelism team, since it got some traction in press before we got briefed about what it actually was. We scurried around and had meetings to come to a conclusion to what it actually was.</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://robertnyman.com/images/1307/b2g-wiki-page.png\" /></p>
<p>Almost two years ago I wrote my first article for the Mozilla Hacks blog about it: <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/07/announcing-boot-to-gecko-b2g-booting-to-the-web/\">Announcing Boot to Gecko (B2G) – Booting to the Web</a>.</p>
<p>Over time, the project developed and a lot of things were ironed out, in establishing what the main focus would be, what the core undertaking encompassed and how to move forward.</p>
<h3>What it really is</h3>
<p>The idea with Firefox OS is to develop a mobile platform that is completely open, and which gives a lot more possibilities to developers, partners and, ultimately, consumers. As I’ve stated many times, the idea is not to compete with iPhones and high-end Android phones, but rather to offer an alternative to emerging markets. How can people who have no phones, or old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone\">feature phones</a>, get access to a smartphone for a really low cost?</p>
<p>How can we continue to ensure that the Internet is as democratic as it can be, that as many as possible can take part and contribute without having to pay many hundreds of US dollars to just get in through the front door?</p>
<p>There’s an estimate of two billion (!) more people coming online in the next few years, and a vast majority of them will do it through mobile. How can we help them, give them affordable options?</p>
<p>We at Mozilla believe we can do that through a completely open device, enabling everyone to contribute to it, afford it and also inspire and influence other players in the mobile field to make their devices more open, more powerful when it comes to the Open Web and priced at a realistic level.</p>
<h4>True open source</h4>
<p>From day one, the repository was available on GitHub. Day one. Everything that has been developed since then has been real-time, and possible for anyone to see, analyze and contribute to. The project first lived in a person’s own repository, but was then moved into a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G\">Mozilla one</a>.</p>
<h3>Introducing WebAPIs</h3>
<p>My own belief – and I’ve stated this many times – is that where I personally think Apple took the wrong path was with how to build things for the iPhone. With the first version they said that all should be the web and you could access it through the mobile Safari web browser. The problem was, of course, that no web site could access anything on the device, like contacts, camera etc. Basically, while the iPhone was a massive leap forward for mobile phones, developers were less than excited with the lack of possibilities for them to build things.</p>
<p>Then Apple went down the path with Objective-C, The App Store and the rest is history. I much more wish that they had chosen to make the web part much stronger, give it access to local device APIs and evolve into the powerful platform it deserves to be. But alas, that didn’t happen, and they went with their own closed and proprietary approach.</p>
<p>So, someone else had to make it happen. In August of 2011, I wrote the <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/08/introducing-webapi/\">first blog post about our WebAPIs iniative at Mozilla</a>, which targeted just that need of improving access for the web layer. Since then I’ve written a number of articles about various APIs and our dedication to standardize these – because if we only did it for us, we wouldn’t do the best for the Open Web.</p>
<p>My most extensive post on APIs was <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/02/using-webapis-to-make-the-web-layer-more-capable/\">Using WebAPIs to make the web layer more capable</a>, which I believe is a good introduction to just how many things you can do from the web layer.</p>
<h3>Apps – what are they and do we need them?</h3>
<p>With Apple’s move with the App Store, <em>everyone</em> wanted to create their own store, where they had complete control, their own APIs and with the goal of making a lot of money. Which is fair, they are businesses and they protect their interests.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe the web and just using URLs to get something is the most powerful thing we have, and something we should cherish and protect for the future. And then if you need a shortcut (bookmarks, anyone?) you can add a web page/URL to your home screen and that’s it.</p>
<p>Users will gain from this and developers will need to build with one technology – the web – instead of having a separate team for each mobile platform. With Firefox OS, the goal has not been to have developers learn something from scratch, but rather utilize and reuse heir existing Open Web technologies.</p>
<p>Since user’s have gotten so used to apps, we are offering that possibility in Firefox OS as well, but have made sure that it’s based on the Open Web (I’ve written more in detail about this in <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/02/getting-started-with-open-web-apps-why-and-how/\">Getting started with Open Web Apps – why and how</a>).</p>
<p>We also have a <a href=\"https://marketplace.firefox.com/\">Firefox Marketplace</a> where you can submit your apps, for findability, payments and more. What’s crucial to know here, though is that you don’t have to build an app if you don’t want to, you don’t have to use the Marketplace – apps are installable from anywhere. Over time, we hope that other people can create their own dedicated Marketplaces as well, for certain topics or local interests.</p>
<p>You could just as well continue to build your own mobile HTML5 web site – with Responsive Design, of course – and you will be good to go on Firefox OS. I see apps an optional approach, not the one and only. The choice is <em>yours</em>.</p>
<h4>Finding mobile web sites that are only on the web</h4>
<p>Also, for users, if you swipe to the left from the home screen in Firefox OS, you will get to the <a href=\"http://blog.everything.me/2013/02/25/exciting-times-at-everything-me/\">integrated Everything.me service</a> – finding mobile web sites out there that you can test first, and then pin to your home screen if you want to.</p>
<h3>Along came Web Activities</h3>
<p>With above mentioned WebAPIs, there are some things on a mobile that are to sensitive to expose and give complete access to, like telephony or SMS. But, naturally there are use cases where you’d want to trigger and interact with them from your content or app. Therefore, we <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/01/introducing-web-activities/\">introduced Web Activities</a>, which gives you a simple and powerful way to do just that, and with a connected user experience and approval.</p>
<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://robertnyman.com/images/1307/Web-Activities.png\" /></p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>It has also been interesting to see how tools and options have developed, to test this open platform in a simple and lightweight manner. I’m tremendously grateful for the work by Myk Melez and others on the <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/firefox-os-simulator-3-0-released/\">Firefox OS Simulator</a>, and I’ve happy to have been able to help developers by creating the <a href=\"https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App\">Firefox OS Boilerplate App</a> – all based on developers’ needs and input.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App-new-UI.png\" /></a></p>
<h3>When it took off</h3>
<p>When it really got exciting, and things started to take off, was about six months after the initial announcement. It was time for the massive <a href=\"http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/\">Mobile World Conference</a> in Barcelona, <em>the</em> place to be at if you were doing something in the mobile sector.</p>
<p>I watched it from afar, and tried to assist the announcements and attention with writing about it in <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/mozillas-boot-to-gecko-the-web-is-the-platform/\">Mozilla’s Boot to Gecko – The Web is the Platform</a> and <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/gaia-mozillas-user-interface-for-boot-to-gecko-all-web-technologies/\">Gaia, Mozilla’s user interface for Boot to Gecko – all web technologies</a>. It gained an enormous interest and from then, it has been busy days.</p>
<h3>Mobile World Conference, anno 2013</h3>
<p>This year I decided to go to Mobile World Congress, I had to be a part of what was going on. And it was such a wonderful and extremely intense experience! Working from early morning till <em>late</em> nights, talking, learning, sharing. It was wonderful to see all the interest and hope around Firefox OS, something that I believe must be somewhat akin to the 1.0 release of Firefox. How can we create something open and make a difference?</p>

<h3>Today’s the day</h3>
<p>Yesterday <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/07/01/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">we announced that the first Firefox OS devices are coming into the market</a>, and today the very first devices will be available for sale in Madrid, Spain. There are a number of other countries and places to be announced in the very near future, and with a lot of hardware and operator partners, this is so exciting!</p>
<p>There has been so much hard work by so many people going into this: to make it work, to get through the hard times, to seal the the deals, to understand, educate and inspire developers. A lot of effort has gone into this, but for me, I don’t regret one second. And <strong>thank you</strong> to eveyone for all your contributions to this project!</p>
<p>I was there day one. I was along for the entire ride, from the first code commit to seeing the actual devices being launched, to people owning them. It has been a magic experience, and frankly, I’m a bit touched. Within one’s career, I don’t believe many get the chances to be there from the initial spark to the the launch of a completely new mobile operating system.</p>
<p>And this is not the end. It has just begun.</p>

I figured it was about time I'd update people reading along with some of the stuff that I've been working on lately(of course with the help of the rest of the Graphics team and others!). I will be using the term Moz2D in this post to refer to our new graphics API that was formerly known under the name 'Azure'.</p>
<p><strong>Moz2D Stand-Alone Build & Repository</strong></p>
<p>In order to make it easier for both ourselves, partners and potential 3rd parties interested in using Moz2D to build and work with the Moz2D API, I now have a stand-alone repository that contains the Moz2D basic library code, the player and some testing applications. The exact status of this repository is still to be determined, and no automation is applied to it yet, however we are making sure it keeps building and remains up to date! It can be found <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/users/bschouten_mozilla.com/moz2d/\">here</a>. Some basic build instructions are available <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX#Testing.2C_replaying.2C_building_Moz2D\">here</a>, I will try to post more detailed build information, also for the different dependencies such as Cairo and Skia, somewhere in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Direct2D 1.1 Integration</strong></p>
<p>We've been working towards a Direct2D 1.1 backend in Moz2D. Direct2D 1.1 was included with Windows 8 and is provided as an update to Windows 7 users. It includes a wide range of API additions, several of which give us the ability to implement the Moz2D feature set with reduced and cleaner code. In addition to that some of the API additions should promise some performance improvements. We have refrained from using some of the new APIs in the Direct2D 1.1 implementation as of yet however, since at the moment they seem to increase the complexity without offering the expected performance benefits. As we begin rolling out Direct2D 1.1 integration to actual firefox users I'll attempt to provide more information on what we discover along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Moz2D Recording & Performance Analysis Improvements</strong></p>
<p>Another thing that we've been working on has been increased recording abilities as well as an increased ability to get useful information out of these recordings. Although the priority for this has been relatively low, steady improvements are being made and it has proven to be a large asset in the creation of new Moz2D backends.</p>
<p>First of all it's now possible to create a recording of a specific page using a single command when using Firefox nightly, an example looks like this (assuming 'recording' is a valid, clean profile of firefox):</p>
<blockquote><p>firefox -no-remote -P recording -recording file://C:\\Users\\Bas\\Dev\\mytest.html -recording-output mytest.aer</p></blockquote>
<p>We're currently still working out some problems which will often cause recordings to be terminated prematurely and therefore come up empty. But this should be fairly easy to fix. Do note this needs to be done on a system where Moz2D content is enabled, for now, this is only windows, although it should soon include OS X as well!</p>
<p>Once the recording is completed several (experimental) possibilities have been added. First of all the Moz2D player has gotten additional features, see a screenshot below for the updated look:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.basschouten.com/media/blogs/blog/azure/player2dscr.png\"><img alt=\"Player2D Screenshot\" src=\"http://www.basschouten.com/media/blogs/blog/azure/player2dscr.png\" title=\"Player 2D (click for a larger version!)\" width=\"450\" /><br />Click for a larger version</a></p>
<p>Note that it's now possible to replay the recording with different drawing backends (depending on your build). This easily makes it possible when adding backends to find flaws in new implementations by comparing drawing results with established backends. We've also added the possibility to analyze timings on a per-call basis to find performance bottlenecks for different backends. In addition to that a separate application called 'recordbench' has been added which is in a very early stage, this essentially is a very simple tool that reports timings for a recording across a range of backends. Trough this application we should be able to do automated performance comparisons between different drawing backends.</p>
<p>Finally we've added a micro-benchmark suite that allows us to make detailed performance comparisons on a per-backend basis. The intention of all this being to give us the ability to make well-informed decisions in the future as to what drawing backends to prefer on specific platforms/configurations.</p>

The performance team also joined us as there are various joint projects between our teams. After the week is over it’s interesting to look back and see what was accomplished during the week and what it opened as guidance for our future work. Here is my personal recap, some of the highlights of what I did and what I saw during the week. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally met with Irving, with whom I’ve been working in the past few months in our project to move the Add-ons Manager storage from SQLite to JSON and making it off-main-thread (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853389\">bug 853389</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853388\">bug 853388</a>)</li>
<li>We did a triage of performance-related bugs to classify them into high impact and low impact and figure out where to focus</li>
<li>Got to see some of the great progress that Tim Taubert and Avi has done on the tabstrip animations and got Tim to help me use the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=453650\">reflow observers</a> to do some experiments of my own in the UI. I didn’t find any obvious low hanging fruits, which is expected since he has fixed various offenders since introducing these reflows observers, but the attempt was worthwhile</li>
<li>Using the profiler I noticed some long stacks for text reflowing during tab animations, but these didn’t translate into any measurable slowness. In any case, I started some hacking to see if it was possible to improve it anyway. The issue is that the title in a tab has to be constantly remeasured for cropping while a tab opening animation is happening. I wrote a patch to only display the tab title and favicon after the animation has completed, and then got together with Avi to run his tab animation FPS tests and see what changes. The answer was: not much, there were no visible gains. In hindsight, there’s an obvious reason: even though we can hide the text in the tab that is opening, we can’t do it for the other open tabs, which will all be potentially shrinking and re-cropping at the same time. However, the investigation was very useful nonetheless, because we discovered two issues with the APIs used to measure the FPS on Mac: a telemetry measurement have been inactive since OMTC has been activated; and the framerate was always stuck on vsynced even with different values for layout.frame_rate (which is useful to tweak when doing animation stress tests)</li>
<li>Got together with Paolo to discuss the plans and current state of the Downloads API off-main-thread project, which I’ll be joining to help (starting with <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=852482\">bug 852482</a>)</li>
<li>Watched Vladan present his findings about <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/vdjeric/2013/05/01/running-nightly-23-from-an-sd-card/\">running Firefox on an SD card</a>. I had already seem the video through his blog post but watching it again and going into more details was very interesting, as the extreme slow disk IO is not only an artificial case produced on SD cards, but also something that many users have to face daily on machines with older hard drives and anti-virus software than can significantly worsen the problems.</li>
<li>Vladan’s talk was also of particular interest to me as it serves as motivation and validation for the work I’ve been involved with in the last significant number of months: the Add-ons Manager work and now the Downloads API.</li>
<li>And various converstations about <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis\">Electrolysis</a>, including a good talk with Yoric to understand how the ongoing work on session restore and e10s will interact</li>
</ul>
<p>And beyond that there were also various other topics that benefited from having the team all together in one place, specially Social API and Australis. To me personally the week was immensely helpful as a motivator and as a way to get consensus and clarity into our upcoming projects, not to mention the fine chance of directly interacting with the entire team which not often happens as we’re all spread around the around!</p>
<p>As a side note, this blog post was an exercise in itself as one of the outcomes for me from the Summit Assembly meeeting we had at the week before. There’s more on it that needs a separate blog post to explain, but a personal action that I’ve taken from that event is to increase the transparency and involvement with the community about the work I do.</p>

<p>I just switched from an Android phablet made by Samsung, device I came to hate for many reasons, to a Firefox OS Geeksphone Keon. That was my second Android phone, I switched because I got it for free<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/pnote-839-1\" id=\"rev-pnote-839-1\">1</a>]</sup>, needed a carrier that worked better than the failure that is WIND Mobile on which I was using my Nexus One<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/pnote-839-2\" id=\"rev-pnote-839-2\">2</a>]</sup> and said Nexus One was just abandoned in OS upgrade by HTC AND Google after 22 month. I have to admit I missed the Nexus One, still, as Samsung didn't make Android better, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Back to the point. I got that Geeksphone Keon, provided by my employer: Mozilla.</p>
<p>This is not a review of the phone, BTW, and all of this also applies to the <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/07/01/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">just released Firefox OS phone in Spain</a>.</p>
<p>On my Android phablet<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.figuiere.net/pnote-839-3\" id=\"rev-pnote-839-3\">3</a>]</sup> I used 4 applications: the web browser, a twitter client (not Twitter's own though), Instagram and Foursquare.</p>
<p>On my Firefox OS phone, I had to scrap the last two. Why? Because despite requiring an internet connection and having some sort of web interface, their are unusable on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Web browser</strong></p>
<p>On Android I used Firefox for Android as my web browser. It is currently the best solution for web browsing is designed to protect your privacy and to run on more devices than Google's own Chrome. Call me biased if you want but truth is I have been using Firefox on the desktop too.</p>
<p>Firefox OS web browser is basically the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong></p>
<p>Twitter is a bit hurtfull. It is designed from the ground up to be used as a web application. Twitter has a mobile version that is meant to work well on small screen. They even have a packaged version for the Firefox OS Marketplace. Where it hurts is that Twitter web UI remains awful, either deliberately (given that the iOS client is awfull too) or because we got spoiled by third-party clients. On Android I was using Twicca (no source code) or Twidere (broke a bit at one point), but it should be noted that Twitter gave the finger to third parties when they added restriction on the development of client ; as well as bickering with Instagram to not show their content inline.</p>
<p>They get almost full marks for being a web app and treating it as first class.</p>
<p><strong>Foursquare</strong></p>
<p>On the desktop, if you go to Foursquare you get a decent web application, albeit you can do the major feature that Foursquare calls for: check-in.</p>
<p>On mobile, if I visit the website on Firefox for Android I get prompted to download an app.</p>
<p>On Firefox OS it is worse. Looks like their detection fail and they offer the desktop website that is mostly unusable on such a small screen. I filed <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=878132\">bug 878132</a> for our tech evangelism to eventually have a look at.</p>
<p>Seems like they didn't go all the way to make it relevant on mobile web. Sadly. What was an experiment I started by the end of last year when I signed up for the service stopped here right at Firefox OS. It seems that I don't need it. They lost a user.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong></p>
<p>This one is the worst of the worst. First and foremost their web interface for desktop is very limited. Secondly, it doesn't scale at all on mobile - some content scale better than other. Third, they bickered with Twitter so that their content is not viewable inline.</p>
<p>Why does that last one matter? Try viewing the instagram content in the Twitter mobile web client.</p>
<p>I give a F as a mark.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Simply make your mobile app web based. It will run on iOS, Android, Firefox OS, Blackberry, etc. and people will be able to follow when they change phone and you won't need to spend a lot of resources for each platforms.</p>
<p>Also if you really want to have a packaged app, remember there are technologies like <a href=\"http://phonegap.com/\">PhoneGap</a> whose purpose is exactly that.</p>

<p>Initially, I planned for this post to include an epic infographic showing all of the places I’ve been, the people I’ve talked to, and so on. But that task would take a whole day of my time – and that’s time I haven’t got! Working at Mozilla is exciting, but busy. Suffice to say that <strong>I’ve attended 53 events in the 52 weeks I’ve been at Mozilla</strong> and I’ve usually been speaking at or running workshops at them. When you factor in Christmas shutdown at PTO (a.k.a. holiday) then that’s pretty impressive/scary.</p>
<p>I’ve been many places this past year evangelising Mozilla’s mission and, in particular, the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI). I’ve been to Canada (twice), several places in the US, the Netherlands (twice), Belgium, Portugal, Ireland, all over the UK… the list goes on. That sounds great but, as any business traveller will tell you, you don’t usually get to do the touristy things; most of what you see is the inside of airports, hotels, planes, trains and automobiles. Having said that, it beats sitting at the same desk day-in, day-out. <img alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> </p>

<p>I’m often asked what it’s like to work for Mozilla. As people ask that question their eyes often light up as if it’s a magic wonderland. It’s <em>not</em> unicorns and rainbows all the time and I certainly recognise the ‘inability to switch off’ problem that Rob Hawkes mentioned in his post upon <a href=\"http://rawkes.com/articles/on-leaving-mozilla\">leaving Mozilla</a>. In that post he talked about stress and burnout as well. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it) I experienced stress, burnout and working crazy hours as a teacher and senior leader while still in my 20′s. That means both I and my family are well-equipped to spot and deal with the tell-tale signs of stress. I know when to rest and how to look after myself these days.</p>
<p>But working at Mozilla is, if not a magic wonderland, certainly <em>different </em>and<em> pretty awesome</em>. I’ve never experienced such freedom and devolved responsibility as I do here. Nor have I ever worked with people who are so talented, motivated and great at communicating using technology. It’s also wonderful knowing that you’re playing a part in making a difference on a global scale. <em>Especially</em> with the work that I’m involved in around <a href=\"http://openbadges.org\">Open Badges</a> and the <a href=\"http://mzl.la/weblitstd\">Web Literacy Standard</a> I feel like this is stuff that could significantly improve the educational and career opportunities of the next generation. Given that’s my children’s generation, it makes me proud to work for a global non-profit where <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/\">doing good is part of our code</a>.</p>

One thing of interest mentioned in the announcement today was “One of our<a href=\"http://www.appcelerator.com/thinkmobile/surveys/\"> recent surveys</a> found Firefox OS to be more compelling to developers over Tizen, Blackberry and Kindle Fire” and I totally agree with this.

When enterprises (and others) are customizing Firefox, I get asked pretty much the same questions every time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I disable private browsing?</li>
<li>How do I turn off Firefox Sync?</li>
<li>How do I prevent access to about:config?</li>
<li>How do I prevent the installation of add-ons?</li>
<li>How do I prevent access to the add-ons manager?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Doing any of these things properly is actually quite difficult, because none of the people that developed these features ever thought that someone would want to disable them. I think the primary reason for this is that most people that create software have only ever experienced how one type of person uses a computer. They believe that everyone uses a computer like they do; they have full access to the computer, they can do whatever they want and they can customize the computer however they want. This narrow view causes them to create software for people like them.
</p>
<p>
The reality is that people use computers in many different ways. In many industries, organizations, governments and educational institutions, there is a need to prevent people from having too much access to the computer and the browser. And it's not just things like kiosks. It could be shared computers at a hospital or bank, or it could be simply that the employees are not very computer literate and you want to make sure they have limited access. Or maybe the browser is used on a piece of equipment and you want to make sure it can't be messed with. There are tons of reasons why someone would want to disable certain features.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you create a new feature, you should ask yourself this questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there a good reason why someone would want to disable this feature?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is yes, you should provide a single global preference that removes the entire feature. You should also ensure that when this preference is locked, any associated UI associated with that feature is disabled.
</p>
<p>
Asking this simple question before implementing a new feature will go a long way towards making sure Firefox is enterprise ready.</p>" nil nil "73a3d6ab3a09bcda1febc005e255800f") (176 (20946 37587 450676) "http://ednapiranha.com/2013/you-wont-know-unless-you-try/" "Jen Fong-Adwent: You Won't Know Unless You Try" nil "Mon, 01 Jul 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "Everyone has at least one idea.

I worked with the system, I helped developers port their apps to it and I spend hours and hours writing about it, making demos and talking to the press and anyone who’d stand still long enough (or sit on a plane next to me). Today I got my reward with the FirefoxOS movement going from “Idea” via “Prototype” to “Developer Preview” and now “Launch”.</p>
<p>As announced today on the Mozilla blog <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/press/2013/07/mozilla-and-partners-prepare-to-launch-first-firefox-os-smartphones/\">Mozilla and Partners Prepare to Launch First Firefox <span class=\"caps\">OS </span>Smartphones</a> and by prepare this means adding the shiny bow to the boxes containing phones that end users will be able to buy.</p>
<p>According to the <a href=\"http://pressoffice.telefonica.com/jsp/base.jsp?contenido=/jsp/notasdeprensa/notadetalle.jsp&id=0&origen=portada&idm=eng&pais=1&elem=20030\">Telefonica blog announcement</a> this will be very soon indeed and the offer is pretty amazing:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Movistar to offer the <span class=\"caps\">ZTE </span>Open for €69, including €30 of balance for prepaid customers and a 4GB microSD card.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Not only is the price very competitive, you <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu8q-oISbas\">get a great phone for that</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve said this many times before, but let me now here repeat the things that really get me excited like a 5 year old on sugar rush about Firefox OS:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Firefox OS kills the idea of mobile web connectivity only being for the rich in the western world.</strong> Yes, for us in the US or the UK having a new shiny phone every half year is not an issue as companies are killing each other trying to underbid the price and offers of the others. But a usable Android that is not generations behind and hard-wired to a terrible stock browser or an iPhone is just not affordable to everyone. Even worse, if you have no credit card you couldn’t even buy apps for them. This is unfair, elitist and plainly against anything the web stands for. FirefoxOS is affordable, and apps can be bought on prepay or on your phone bill and the OS is the browser which means updates are easy</li><li><strong>FirefoxOS does not assume a fast, stable and always available connection</strong>. When traveling I start hating my Android phone which I love to bits otherwise. Having dozens of megabyte updates over roaming is out of the question and neither is using flaky and slow wireless connections. Firefox OS has no native apps – all of them, including the system apps are written in <span class=\"caps\">HTML</span>, CSS and JavaScript. Thus they are much smaller and can have atomic updates instead of having to be replaced as a unit every single time.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS is the web in your pocket.</strong> It is Firefox and nothing else (other than a Linux core to access the hardware). Thus I will not be told to “download the native app” when I go to web sites that are perfectly fine to use.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS is the platform <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> deserves</strong> For developers, our <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> solutions are finally first-class citizens. We are not shoved into a slower web view and told we can not access the hardware.</li><li><strong>Firefox OS apps are web distributed apps.</strong> Users can go to the marketplace and find our apps by hand or via review or they could search for a certain song, movie, football team and dish and find our app that way. App discovery is as simple as using the web and finding web sites. Instead of having to pay as a developer and be at the mercy of the T&C of closed marketplaces I can publish a Firefox OS app by adding a button and calling the open web apps <span class=\"caps\">API</span>. That way my current web site is the ad for my app and all my visitors potential app users.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>All of this is obvious to me as a geek but doesn’t mean anything if we don’t get devices in the hands of end users. And this is what happens now – big time! Alcatel, <span class=\"caps\">ZTE</span>, Telefonica, Deutsche Telekom, Spain and Poland. The fox really is out of the bag now. And oh how it will roam and run into many other directions. Be part of this, as a web developer, it is the most rewarding platform that will not change from under you at the whim of company goals or shareholder demands.</p>

<p>Mozilla’s goal is to build openness, innovation, and opportunity into online life.   One of our biggest levers is of course building products.   We build products that provide a great user experience and engender openness, innovation and opportunity into the technology of the Web itself.</p>
<p>Firefox has done this in many ways.  Firefox was a pioneer in the world of open source consumer products, in open techniques for feedback, support, and quality, just to name a few examples.  We have always built Firefox to give developers huge opportunities for innovation in areas they care about.  We do not seek to control the ways developers can innovate, or the way people take control of their software.</p>
<p>As a result, Firefox helped usher in a whole new era of Web computing, bringing new experiences for users and new freedoms for developers.  Today Firefox continues to pioneer new technologies and features that benefit users.  Some recent examples include features such as Do Not Track, which allows people to tell websites they do not wish to be tracked around the Web, and our Social API that makes the browsing experience more personal and customizable.</p>
<p>With Firefox OS we hope to do something similar with the mobile computing environment.  We want to bring the power of the open Web to this world.  We want to bring the same kinds of flexibility, opportunity and freedom to this computing environment that the original Firefox brings to the desktop.  More specifically, we want  Firefox OS to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prove that the Web is the platform, surprise people with what HTML5 is capable of on mobile devices.</li>
<li>Advance adoption of mobile Web standards and APIs across the industry, including on other operating systems.</li>
<li>Spur developer innovation; break the mold of what a mobile app is capable of.</li>
<li>Make the open Web accessible to more people.</li>
<li>Spur competition in making the Web the platform for mobile computing.</li>
<li>Excite people.</li>
<li>Provide a powerful, exciting and open alternative to the current closed ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll note that I haven’t included something like “we want to ship X numbers of phones.”  Ultimately, we want enough people choosing Firefox OS to confirm we’ve built a great product and to move us toward  a more open mobile computing platform based on the Web.    Our goal is to provide an alternative that has a deep and exciting user experience based on openness, choice and competition.</p>" nil nil "b2ad1bc6be718225ed0961606fa07a27") (172 (20945 21910 604326) "http://mcc.id.au/blog/2013/07/firefox-svg-text-improvements" "Cameron McCormack: Improved SVG text support in Firefox Nightly" "Cameron McCormack" "Mon, 01 Jul 2013 08:48:19 +0000" "<p>On the weekend, I landed the final patch in what turned out to be quite a long running project to overhaul Firefox’s SVG text support to reuse the same text layout and rendering code that it uses for HTML.

<p>Improvements resulting from this work include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration\">text-decoration</a>’ property is now honoured, so underlines, strike-throughs and overlines are painted.</li>
<li>Searching for text on a page will now search through and highlight SVG text.</li>
<li>Text can be selected with the mouse.</li>
<li>Layout of bidirectional text when there are multiple child nodes of a <code><text></code> element is now correct.</li>
<li>The ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space\">white-space</a>’ property now applies to SVG text.  In the future, in SVG 2, ‘white-space’ will be recommended method to control white space handling rather than <code>xml:space=\"\"</code>.  ‘white-space’ can be used to render manually wrapped text when using the <code>pre</code> and <code>pre-line</code> values.  ‘<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height\">line-height</a>’ is used to determine the spacing between lines.</li>
<li>Various <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-fonts/\">CSS3 Font properties</a>, including the new ‘font-variant’ related properties to turn on and off OpenType features, now apply to SVG text.</li>
<li>The <code>:first-letter</code> and <code>:first-line</code> pseudo-elements now apply to SVG text.</li>

The data collected was largely what we call <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis\">traffic analysis</a></em> data: who talked to whom, where, when, using what mechanism.  It was mostly <em>not</em> the actual contents of the conversations, but so much can be deduced from “who talked to whom, when” that this should not reassure you in the slightest.  If you haven’t seen the demonstration that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/06/prism_metadata_analysis_paul_revere_identified_by_his_connections_to_other.single.html\">just by compiling and correlating membership lists, the British government could have known that Paul Revere would’ve been a good person to ask pointed questions about revolutionary plots in the colonies in 1772</a>, go read that now.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s safe to assume we know <em>anything</em> about the <em>details</em> of this data collection: especially not the degree of cooperation the government obtained from telcos and other private organizations.  There are too many layers of secrecy involved, there’s probably no one who has the complete picture of what the various three-letter agencies were <em>supposed</em> to be doing (let alone what they actually <em>were</em> doing), and there’s too many people trying to bend the narrative in their own preferred direction.  However, I also don’t think the details matter all that much at this stage.  That the program existed, and was successful enough that the NSA was bragging about it in an internal PowerPoint deck, is enough for the immediate conversation to go forward.  (The details may become very important later, though: especially details about who got to make use of the data collected.)</p>
<p>Lots of other people have been writing about why this program is a Bad Thing: Most critically, large traffic-analytic databases are <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/174851/strange-case-barrett-brown#ixzz2X1oYM1xV\">easy to abuse for politically-motivated witch hunts</a>, which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover#Investigation_of_subversion_and_radicals\">can and have occurred in the US in the past</a>, and arguably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/26/nsa-revelations-response-to-smears\">are now occurring as a reaction to the leaks</a>.  One might also be concerned that this <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/06/preventing_cell.html\">makes it harder to pursue other security goals</a>; that it gives other countries an incentive to partition the Internet along national boundaries, <a href=\"http://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2013/06/provoking-national-boundaries-internet-chilling-thought\">harming its resilience</a>; or that it <a href=\"https://medium.com/surveillance-state/f77088fd4c28\">further harms the US’s image abroad</a>, which was already not doing that well; or that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/29/tomorrows-surveillance/\">the <em>next</em> surveillance program will be even worse if this one isn’t stopped</a>.
(Nothing new under the sun: Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis’ argument in “<a href=\"http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/Brandeisprivacy.htm\">The Right to Privacy</a>” in 1890 is still as good an explanation as any you’ll find of why the government should not spy on the general public.)</p>
<p>I want to talk about something a little different; I want to talk about why the <em>secrecy</em> of these ubiquitous surveillance programs is at least as harmful to good governance as the programs themselves.</p>

<h3>Secrecy culture</h3>
<p><a href=\"http://www.owlfolio.org/media/2013/06/loose-lips-sink-ships-posters2.jpg\"><img alt=\"World War II-era propaganda poster of sinking steamship with the words “Loose LIPS Sink Ships” superimposed.\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1514\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.owlfolio.org/media/2013/06/loose-lips-sink-ships-posters2-196x300.jpg\" width=\"196\" /></a></p>
<p>If you’ve had any exposure at all to the US military-industrial complex, you will have noticed two things: its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/jun/12/prism-nsa-powerpoint-graphic-design\">institutional idiom of horrible PowerPoint slide decks</a>, and its obsession with secrecy. No doubt this started with the entirely appropriate goal of <em>operational</em> secrecy: you don’t make it easy for the enemy to find and sink your troopships. But secrecy is contagious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you decide that something is so dangerous that the entire world
hinges on keeping it under control, this sense of fear and dread
starts to creep outwards. The worry about what must be controlled
becomes insatiable—and pretty soon the mundane is included with
the existential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so <a href=\"http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/2012/08/29/forbidden-spheres/\">all round objects become classified</a>. (quote is from linked article) This culture of secrecy is especially obvious where nuclear bombs are concerned, but it pervades every part of the complex, even to the groups and organizations that aren’t doing anything that’s formally secret. The default action is not to talk, and the default policy is to lock up the files. Publishing one’s research is an unusual action that must be justified and approved. Going on public record about an agency’s plans and activities is positively aberrant. I think this is why the US government collectively, quite a few officials personally, an awful lot of reporters in <a href=\"http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/yearning-to-be-subjects-journalist.html\">the “establishment” news media</a>,  and <a href=\"http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2013/06/one-of-things-i-find-most-fascinating.html\">a truly depressing number of private citizens</a>, have been acting as if <em>reporting that spying is going on</em> is far, far worse than the spying itself. In the mind of someone invested in secrecy culture, leaking a secret is worse than anything. It <em>isn’t done</em>.  And what with the military-industrial complex being the single largest employer in the country, and its attitudes trickling down to state and local government as well, it wouldn’t surprise me if nearly every citizen has had <em>some</em> contact with secrecy culture.</p>
<p>This hit me personally last weekend. I was at my grandmother’s 90th birthday party and one of my relatives wanted to know what I thought of the news. The conversation went around in circles for a while because we were both agreeing with each other that we were disgusted that such a thing could happen, but it turned out that <em>I</em> was disgusted by the spying and <em>he</em> was disgusted by the government’s failure to keep the spying secret.  Once this became clear, I said to him that I didn’t think the spying should have been secret in the first place, and that made so little sense to him that it ended the conversation.</p>
<h3>Kerckhoffs’ Principle</h3>
<p>The thing is, too much secrecy turns out to be self-defeating. This is well-understood in cryptography; it is the famous principle proposed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Kerckhoffs\">Auguste Kerckhoffs</a> in 1883:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The system [that is, the algorithm for encrypting messages] must not
be required to be secret. It must be able to fall into the hands of
the enemy without  inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is counterintuitive. Why <em>wouldn’t</em> you conceal your encryption algorithm from the enemy? Indeed, even though Kerckhoffs wrote in 1883, up till about 1977 everyone did just that, believing that it couldn’t <em>hurt</em>. And some people, not to mention some major industrial standards organizations who ought to know better, still do. Unfortunately, it turns out that it <em>does</em> hurt.  Cryptographic algorithms are difficult to design, and unforgiving of errors.  A design that hasn’t been vetted by lots of people is almost surely flawed.  If you publish an algorithm and invite feedback, you attract attention from many more cryptographers than you could hope to employ internally, and they’ll tell you when they find a problem.  Meantime, <em>whether or not</em> you publish an algorithm, the odds are that the enemy will find out how it works.  But when <em>they</em> find a flaw, they won’t tell you about it; they’ll just <em>use</em> it to read your messages. If you’re very lucky, before this happens, someone relatively well-disposed to you will discover your secret algorithm, find the flaws, and <a href=\"http://www.owlfolio.org/research/the-conference-formerly-known-as-oakland-day-1/#dont-trust-satellite-phones\">tell you about it in a highly public and embarrassing manner</a>.</p>
<p>But Kerckhoffs’ Principle is not just for cryptographic primitives.  It applies to network protocol design, which is very nearly as unforgiving, and not as codified: nowadays security analysts are far more likely to find a mistake in the way a protocol <em>uses</em> a cipher than to break the cipher itself.  It also applies to software in general: there’s a <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceschneier/2012/05/30/the-vulnerabilities-market-and-the-future-of-security/\">black market for “zero-day exploits”</a> (that is, not-yet-fixed security-critical bugs) in both open- and closed-source software, but open-source software attracts more attention from people who would rather see the bugs fixed, because open source (as a social phenomenon) is more inviting of experimentation and feedback.</p>
<p>We can generalize even further, past computer ’ware to other complex systems: such as nation-states and their governments.  The logic of Kerckhoff’s principle predicts that when a political decision <em>isn’t</em> made in public with full knowledge of the situation, it will be more likely to be a bad decision, specifically a decision which can be exploited.  Yet that is precisely the sort of decision making that secrecy culture demands.
If the NSA’s blanket surveillance programs had been public knowledge from the get-go, we could have <a href=\"https://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/06/13/3-questions-about-nsa-surveillance/\">asked pointed questions</a>, starting with “Is this worth the sacrifice of civil liberties?” but also including things like “Does this actually <em>work</em> against criminals who know their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradecraft\">tradecraft</a>?” and “You want <em>how much</em> money?” and of course “That wouldn’t happen to be your father’s brother’s nephew’s cousin’s former roommate’s defense contracting firm you’re proposing to hire, would it now?”</p>
<p>But they weren’t, and we didn’t, and oddly enough, it seems that we have spent <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_12744661\">billions of dollars</a> on a system which <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-23/u-s-surveillance-is-not-aimed-at-terrorists.html\"><em>doesn’t</em> work against competent criminals</a> but which invites <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/06/26/195045/memories-of-stasi-color-germans.html\">unflattering comparisons with the Stasi</a>.  Worse yet, the NSA’s surveillance programs look suspiciously like <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2013/06/07/u-s-never-really-ended-creepy-total-information-awareness-program/\">a continuation of the “Total Information Awareness” program that Congress axed in 2003</a>, which means the secrecy culture is prepared to <em>ignore</em> decisions by its elected overseers that don’t go its way, or twist arms behind the scenes till the decision is—secretly, of course—reversed.  At that point, can we call this a democracy anymore?</p>" nil nil "9e539136d4aa1f30f209f99d394baa4b") (170 (20945 14374 616329) "http://blog.mozilla.org/planet/2013/06/30/planet-additions-class-of-6302013/" "Planet Mozilla Blog: Planet Additions: Class Of 6/30/2013" "raccettura" "Sun, 30 Jun 2013 18:35:52 +0000" "<p><a href=\"http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/\">Michael Coates</a> (<a href=\"http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss\">feed</a>) – I currently have a <a href=\"http://michael-coates.blogspot.com/\">security blog</a> that is listed on planet based on my Mozilla tag.

<p>Of all the trips I’ve taken this year, I think the Mozilla Summit Planning Assembly was the one I looked forward to most – a chance to help shape the future of Mozilla and have great conversations with people who are passionate about the same things I am! I also admit I was really worried that we were too big of a group to get anything done. Turns out I was not alone. We all showed up ready to set the content and agenda for the Mozilla Summit.</p>
<p><strong>A day of tough discussions and building trust</strong></p>
<p>We had some excellent conversations Friday night and Saturday. We did a number of different exercises designed to start conversations and pull out key themes. For example, we started out  Saturday with an “unpanel”. Four people sit in the middle of the group. They have a conversation. There’s an empty chair as well and whenever someone in the audience wants to join the conversation, they slide into the empty seat and one of the four sitting there self selects to go back to the bigger circle leaving an empty chair as an invitation for the next person. While at first it didn’t seem very different than a big group conversation where you passed around the mic, it turned out to be a great way to keep the audience engaged in the conversation. Every one was listening hard. The topics we covered were varied but a lot of it centered around non paid staff vs paid staff relationships – culture and responsibilities. We also talked about things like whether there’d be technical roadmap decisions made at the Summit, how people like to communicate, etc. One of the key takeaways for many of us was that we were all worried about similar issues!</p>
<p>Over the course of the day, <strong>two themes arose</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><strong>Old timers and new hires are having a hard time trusting each other at Mozilla.</strong> I’m sure I didn’t get all the nuances but it felt to me like old timers think new hires might not have the “Mozilla DNA” and might not have an appreciation for our mission and open source methods. And new hires think old timers are stuck and so concerned with consensus they aren’t always getting things done.  Over the weekend, I think we made great progress in killing that stereotype and building good relationships that bridge the gap. (<a href=\"http://lukasblakk.com/my-big-shift/\">Lukas Blakk wrote</a> about this experience as well.) I have to admit that personally I’m not sure where I fell on this stereotype other than feeling rather annoyed at both groups and some how personally responsible for both stereotypes. As a hiring manager, I’ve hired many of those new people. As a long time open source community member, I feel like it’s my job to make sure the “open source” way is considered and well represented.  I also think that part of the problem is how members of each group introduce themselves and represent themselves to the world – more on that later.</span></li>
<li><strong>Mozillians like to get stuff done!</strong> By the end of the day, we were all extremely uncomfortable with all of the discussions, panels and world cafe exercises with no clear idea of how it was going to produce an agenda for the Summit. Luckily our leaders and the Unconference organizers heard all of our concerns and when we turned up the second day, we got to create a rough outline of an agenda and topics for the Summit!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Getting down to work</strong></p>
<p>On the second day we did a “World Cafe” exercise. We had about 7 rooms and 3 time slots and everyone wrote in the topic they wanted to cover in one of the slots. We then did some consolidation and managed to squeeze everything into the ~20 slots.</p>
<p>The idea was to cover themes or topics we thought should be covered at the Mozilla Summit. Each session was to identify Session Title, Goals and Outcomes, People for Followup and What has to happen between now and the Summit. They were all captured in etherpads.</p>
<p>All the sessions I went to had great conversation. It was rather tricky to focus on how that topic would be covered at the Summit instead of just discussing the topic. We tried to focus on how the conversation would best happen at the Summit: what type of presentation it would be, how much should be a proposal vs a discussion, if it was one presentation or a theme, etc. Some times the topic you signed up for was not the topic your group ended up proposing. I attended discussions on communication, diversity (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mozdino\">Dino</a> and <a href=\"http://lukasblakk.com/\">Lukas</a> have a great diagram for a starting conversation!) and helping companies that aren’t used to “open” work with effectively with us.</p>
<p>Then <a href=\"https://commonspace.wordpress.com/\">Mark</a>, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/debbiecohen\">Debbie</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\">Mitchell</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/krnasz\">Kate</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2013/06/20/what-is-was/\">Mardi</a> grouped all of the topics into themes – interestingly “People” had the most topics. Other themes included Strategy, Product, Process and Purpose.</p>
<p>So now we have themes for the Summit. And a lot of proposed topics.</p>
<p>I found it really valuable to spend this time as a group planning for a big event. When you are going to bring 2,000 people together (in groups of 600) I think it’s essential to spend some time uncovering what the real issues that we need to discuss are.</p>
<p><strong>My take aways:</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the bigger goal of planning the Summit, I took away a few more key things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s important to <strong>work together, preferably in person</strong>. We built a lot of trust over the weekend – trust that would have taken much more time to build during our regular day-to-day lives and over the internet. I hope we can take that experience and bring it to the Mozilla Summit.</li>
<li>Mentors. After a conversation with <a href=\"http://diary.braniecki.net/\">Gandalf</a>, I came away thinking part of the solution might be <strong>holding mentors more accountable</strong> and some how measuring their success over time. We also discussed short term mentorship projects too.</li>
<li>How you introduce your self matters. With a few exceptions, most of the <strong>volunteer Mozillians introduced themselves as being “a community member”</strong> or a “Rep”. Most of <strong>paid staff introduced themselves by their functional role</strong> or team, “Firefox for Android”. This is natural as while we all feel like part of the greater Mozilla community, paid staff has in general been hired to do a particular role. But I feel like it’s a big part of the disconnect.</li>
<li><strong>Lots of communication formats</strong> are needed. <a href=\"http://lawrencemandel.com/\">Lawrence Mandel</a> pointed out that not everyone does well speaking in front of large groups at conferences, so whatever format the Summit takes, it needs to enable lots of communication vehicles, meetings, parties, irc, etherpads, newsgroups, … a way for everyone to find enough of their comfort zone so that they can be comfortable enough to participate fully.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Mozilla Summit Planning Assembly was one of the trips I was most looking forward to attending this year and it lived up to my expectations! I’m very excited for the Summit now! (And for all the planning that still has to happen before then!)</p>

<a href=\"https://login.persona.org\">Persona</a> conversations. As part of an
<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/2013/Auth_Jam_Session\">Auth Jam session</a>, a few of us explored the idea of adding
non-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth\">OAuth</a>-based authentication mechanisms to
<a href=\"https://indieauth.com\">IndieAuth</a>.</p>
<p>While <a href=\"http://aaronparecki.com\">Aaron</a> and <a href=\"http://ozten.com\">Austin</a> got
<a href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth/commit/1e5581b2a91b4d455be1310f833026a8c343ec71\">SMS</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth/commit/2dd7d58e26b65af53ea0a3c8659e1779dcb7be41\">Persona</a> working as IndieAuth providers during one of the Sunday hack
sessions, I wanted to explore the idea of IndieAuth (an implementation of
<a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth\">RelMeAuth</a>) as a
<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona/Implementing_a_Persona_IdP\">Persona identity provider</a>.</p>
<h3>Using IndieAuth on any Persona-enabled site</h3>
<p>The goal of this effort was to allow Indie Web developers to use their
preferred email address with Persona and have IndieAuth authenticate them
using any supported IndieAuth provider (e.g. <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/implementing-sign-twitter\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://developer.github.com/guides/basics-of-authentication/\">Github</a>).</p>
<p>This work will help bridge the gap between these two projects and allow
IndieAuth developers to log into more website using their
<a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/How_to_set_up_IndieAuth_on_your_own_domain\">hard-earned credentials</a>.</p>
<h3>User setup</h3>
<p>In order to take advantage of this, users have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Serve a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona/.well-known-browserid\">support document</a> on their <em>email</em> domain declaring
<code>indieauth.com</code> as the authority for their domain.</li>
<li>Include a <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me\"><code>rel=\"me\"</code></a> link for their preferred
email address on their <em>personal</em> domain.</li>
<li>Advertise their <em>personal</em> domain on their <em>email</em> domain via
<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-webfinger\">WebFinger</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, Aaron would use the following support document at
<code>https://parecki.com/.well-known/browserid</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{
\"authority\": \"indieauth.com\"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then he would ensure that there is a <code>rel=\"me\"</code> link on <code>aaronparecki.com</code>
pointing to his preferred email address, <code>aaron@parecki.com</code>:</p>
<pre><code><a href=\"mailto:aaron@parecki.com\" rel=\"me\">Email me</a>
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, because his <em>email</em> domain (<code>parecki.com</code>) is different from his
<em>personal</em> domain (<code>aaronparecki.com</code>), they would need to be linked
together via WebFinger. Thankfully, he found a clever way to do this with
<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/aaronpk/5846789\">a simple Apache rewrite rule and some static files</a>.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Aaron and I worked out the the details of how this will work and wrote a
<a href=\"https://github.com/fmarier/indieauth-personaidp-spec\">walkthrough</a> to illustrate it.</p>
<p>The gist of it is that Persona will ask IndieAuth to certify an email
address and IndieAuth will convert that email address to a personal domain
(using WebFinger) before authenticating the user with one of the IndieAuth
providers enabled on that domain.</p>" nil nil "b669d374b755f8047f880a4bcfd21b0a") (167 (20945 14374 610820) "http://informationisart.com/19" "=?utf-8?Q?Sta=C5=9B_Ma=C5=82olepszy=3A?= Frequently asked questions about L20n" nil "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 23:47:00 +0000" "<p>I'm typing this on a train from Poznań to Warsaw, on my way back from
a <a href=\"http://chemikpil.pl/meet-js-wracamy-w-poznaniu/#post-1744\">meet.js</a> event organized by <a href=\"http://chemikpil.pl/\">Michał Maćkowiak</a>.  It was a great pleasure
to attend the event and to have an opportunity to talk about <a href=\"http://l20n.org\">L20n</a> to Polish
developers.</p>
<p>Whenever I try to explain L20n to people, I first try to understand
what they already know about localization.  I found that it's useful to ask if
a developer has ever shipped a multilingual product, or if an end-user has ever
seen anything similar to the image below, where all but one word of the message
was truncated to fit the screen (there's a good chance they have).</p>
<p class=\"noindent\">
<img src=\"http://informationisart.com/images/responsive.jpg\" />
</p>
<p>Another great way to better know your audience is to listen to questions.  Good
questions are a sign that the audience was able to relate to the problem L20n
is trying to solve.  (To see why the solution is compelling, one has to first
acknowledge the problem.)</p>
<p>I was really happy with the the questions I got after my talk at meet.js.  They
were insightful and inspiring and each one brought something more to the
conversation.  Below I try to recap my answers to recurring and common themes.</p>
<h3>Only localizers know what they need</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Do you expect localizers to have programming experience?</em></p>
<p>No.  We're realistic.  We expect localizers to be experts in localization, not
programming. We're not imposing any complex syntax nor require to write macros
and dict-like data structures.  We do give localizers the freedom to get as
complex as they need, when they need it.  After all, only the localizers know
what is it that they need, and L20n doesn't make any assumptions about the
language it's used to localize into.  It's grammar-agnostic to the extreme.</p>
<p>Fortunately, more often than not there is no need to get any more complex than
the baseline.  When it comes to simple cases, L20n is pleasantly simple :</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><identifier</span> <span class=\"s\">\"A translated value\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
<span class=\"nv\"><multiline</span> <span class=\"s\">\"\"\"</span>
<span class=\"s\">      Multiline strings are easy to read and edit </span>
<span class=\"s\">      thanks to the triple-quote syntax.</span>
<span class=\"s\">    \"\"\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Localizing Mozilla projects has taught us that as many as 90-95% of messages
found in the UI are simple key-value pairs that won't require any advanced
knowledge of L20n's features.</p>
<p>For instance, the <a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/blob/master/tools/perf/example.lol\">file that we use to measure the performance</a> of real-life
usage of L20n, consists of over 500 strings, only 4 of which <em>are not key-value
pairs</em>.  The file is based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/v1.0.1/apps/settings/locales/settings.en-US.properties\">localization file</a> of Firefox OS's largest
app, Settings.</p>
<p>So why develop L20n at all?  Because it's the remaining 5% that make or break
the UI of your app.  They're too important to ignore and they are responsible
for the experience of the user.</p>
<p>L20n was created to cater to these 5%, and admittedly, L20n examples can get
rather complex (see <a href=\"http://l20n.github.io/tinker/\">L20n Tinker</a> for an example).  We're trying to show off
advanced features to explain what's possible with the framework and how it
handles common challenges of the UI design.</p>
<p>The vast majority of languages and use cases probably won't even need them.<br />
L20n's motto say it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep simple things simple.  Make complex things possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Common helpers for each language</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Will there be plural macros built into L20n for each language?</em></p>
<p>We may consider adding common rules for all languages at some point in the
future, but for the 1.0 release we decided to keep the framework lean and leave
them out.</p>
<p>Instead, we're hoping that more experienced localizers, preferably with some
programming knowledge, will step in and create common L20n files to be included
by others in their own projects.  Such files would include commonly-used
helpers like plural macros, translations of the names of the months and the
days of the week, formal and informal greetings depending on the time of day
<em>et cetera</em>.</p>
<p>Consider the following L20n file, <code>common.lol</code>:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">     <span class=\"nv\"><plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$n</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">$n</span> <span class=\"nb\">== </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"nv\">?</span> <span class=\"s\">\"zero\"</span> <span class=\"err\">:</span>
<span class=\"nv\">$n</span> <span class=\"nb\">== </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"nv\">?</span> <span class=\"s\">\"one\"</span> <span class=\"err\">:</span>
<span class=\"s\">\"many\"</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nb\">> </span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You could use the above plural macro in another file by using L20n's handy <code>import</code>
statement.</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\">import</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"ss\">'common.lol</span><span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>
<span class=\"nv\"><unread</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">plural</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">$unreadMessages</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">zero</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"No unread messages.  Good job!\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">one</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"You have one unread message.\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*many</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"You have {{ $unreadMessages }} unread messages.\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Thanks to this approach, the localizer keeps the control over even such basic
features of the localization as the plural selector, which allows for great
flexibility (if needed).</p>
<p>We'd love to see such common files created organically by the community and
shared among localizers in a decentralized manner.</p>
<h3>Context data and for-loops</h3>
<p>Question: <em>If the context data is global, how do I built multi-item UIs?</em></p>
<p>The interface between L20n's context and the data that developer wants to
expose to it indeed makes the data available context-wide.  In other words, if
the developer defines the context data as follows:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"json language-json\">    <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nt\">\"currentUser\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nt\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Jane\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>
<span class=\"nt\">\"gender\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"feminine\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…it will be available to the localizer as <code>$currentUser</code> and can be used in any
entity.  This is an important design concept of L20n which goes back to the
idea that only the localizers can know what they need to properly localize
a message in the UI.  English may not require the user's gender to build
grammatically-correct sentences, but other languages certainly do.</p>
<p>To achieve the same in other localization frameworks, the developer would need
to pass the <code>currentUser</code> object in every call the the framework, just in case
the requested string makes use of that information in some language.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you want to build the UI out of repeating blocks and
exposing data needed by each block would lead to naming conflicts.  In such
cases, you can pass data on a per-entity basis as a second argument to
<a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/tree/1.0.0b3#ctxgetid-string-ctxdata-object\"><code>Context::get</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/tree/1.0.0b3#ctxgetentityid-string-ctxdata-object\"><code>Context::getEntity</code></a>.  Consider the following JavaScript
code:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">    <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">l10n</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'ready'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// ... </span>
<span class=\"nx\">notifications</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">forEach</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">notification</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nx\">nodes</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">].</span><span class=\"nx\">textContent</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">l10n</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">get</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'notification'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// pass notification.fromUser as $fromUser to the requested entity</span>
<span class=\"nx\">fromUser</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">notification</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">fromUser</span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
<span class=\"c1\">// ... </span>
<span class=\"p\">});</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how the developer only asks for the value of the <code>notification</code> entity
and passes <code>notification.fromUser</code> as <code>$fromUser</code>.  Here's what the
corresponding L20n code could look like:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><notification</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants to add you as a friend\"</span><span class=\"nv\">></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or assuming <code>$fromUser</code> has a <code>gender</code> property:</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><notification</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">$fromUser.gender</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants you to add her to your friends\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants you to add him to your friends\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} wants you to add them to your friends\"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It's still possible, of course, to use the context-wide <code>$currentUser</code> variable
in the translation.  In the following example in Polish, the \"wants you
to add\" part needs to be accorded with the gender of the recipient, so it makes
use of both <code>$fromUser</code> passed to it directly and <code>$currentUser</code> available
context-wide.</p>
<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"clojure language-clojure\">    <span class=\"nv\"><notification</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">$fromUser.gender</span>, <span class=\"nv\">$currentUser.gender</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodała ją do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodał ją do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce zostać twoją znajomą\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>
<span class=\"nv\">feminine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodał go do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">masculine</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce, żebyś dodał go do znajomych\"</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce zostać twoim znajomym\"</span>
<span class=\"p\">}</span>,
<span class=\"nv\">*unknown</span><span class=\"err\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"{{ fromUser.name }} chce dodać cię do znajomych\"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>See how this example can progressively get more complex?  It's interesting to
realize that the <code>unknown</code> case for both genders is, in fact, enough to get the
message across in a gramatically correct sentence.  Using more advanced featurs
of L20n, however, allows us to create a much more user-friendly interface which
seamlessly adapts to the user's gender.  As <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_and_Ray_Eames\">Charles Eames</a> famously put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The details are not the details. They make the design.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>L20n is declarative</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Can L20n automatically create declensions of unknown nouns?</em></p>
<p>It's tempting to try to create a framework that—with enough rules codified in
it—would be able to automatically decline nouns or conjugate verbs.  This has
sadly proven to be extremely difficult a task in practice which has been
keeping linguists and programmers busy for years.  Natural languages have too
many rules, too many exceptions and are not context-free.  </p>
<p>I could imagine tools built into L20n that would help create heuristics for
grammatical inflection.  For instance, we could add a method to check if a word
or an <em>n</em>-tuple starts or ends with a given string of characters.  This would
likely lead, however, to localizations becoming state machines, <em>imperatively</em>
trying to guess the correct inflection.  Unfortunately, state machines don't
model the intricacies of natural languages well.</p>
<p>L20n takes a <em>declarative</em> approach to localization, working around grammar
when needed.  Looking at examples of L20n code, it's important to remember that
they are not trying to codify the entire logic of the language's grammar, but
instead, they aim at declaring possible messages that the user might see in the
interface.</p>
<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/l20n/preso/blob/master/meetjs-poznan-2013/miasta.l20n\">one of the examples</a> I demoed during my talk at meet.js, I built a local
entity to store declensions of common city names.  The entity only defined
a nominative and a locative as these were the only cases that mattered in the
use case.  Furthermore, even though the locative case in Polish works with such
prepositions as <em>in</em>, <em>inside</em>, <em>on</em>, <em>ontop</em> and <em>about</em>, the example only
made use of <em>in</em>.  I ended up declaring my own case which I dubbed
<em>locativeIn</em>, which included the preposition.  This allowed me to easily handle
exceptions where the Polish word for <em>in</em> changes slightly to make the whole
expression sound better (<em>w Warszawie</em>—in Warsaw, but <em>we Wrocławiu</em>—in
Wrocław).</p>
<h3>Redundant by design</h3>
<p>Question: <em>Do I need to repeat the entire sentence just to change one
preposition?</em></p>
<p>The last example that I showed was a tiny website that I created during one
coffee break that counted down days and hours to my vacation.  The <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/stasm/5893026\">L20n
resource file</a> for this example is just one macro and one string, and yet
it's 34 lines long.  We designed L20n to be like this on purpose.</p>
<p>The goal was the encourage some repetition and redundancy in the syntax in
order to allow for more customization.  All for the sake of being able to
create better UI.</p>
<p>ICU's <a href=\"http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/text/MessageFormat.html\">MessageFormat</a> and its <a href=\"https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js\">JavaScript implementation</a> handle redundancy
by allowing branching locally inside of localizable strings.  While this is
technically possible (or almost possible) in L20n by using local entities,
I actually think that some redundancy can be healthy and can help improve the
readability of L20n code.</p>

<p>Dear Entrepreneur,</p>
<p>We need you. We – that is the world. Yes, you read that right. The world needs you.</p>
<p>Let me explain: Spain's youth unemployment rate is now close to 60%. Sixty percent. That is more than every second person under the age of 30 being unemployed. Italy's youth unemployment rate recently smashed through the 40% mark. The same is true for many other countries all around the globe. We have more than 7 billion people inhabiting this planet with an annual growth rate of 1.3%. That means we double the population every 50 years. A friend recently told me that we need 600 million sustainable jobs by 2020.</p>
<p>I fundamentally believe that the only way to get there is through entrepreneurship. We need people like you who are building companies, solving some of the most pressing problems in the world and create jobs doing so.</p>
<p>These are pretty scary and incredibly exciting times. While there is revolutions and uprisings looming, we will also witness the world's online population double in the next 5-10 or so years. Imagine what it will mean for the planet to have 2 billion more people with access to the web, Wikipedia and the global marketplace.</p>
<p>With that being said – we have our work cut out for us. Now is the time. Let's get cranking.</p>" nil nil "a5ccfc02f3a6eb5778d6ebee01ed4c6e") (165 (20945 14374 606222) "http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1615" "David Humphrey: Reading =?utf-8?B?4oCcV29yZHPigJ0=?=" "david.humphrey" "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 13:47:40 +0000" "<p>You’ve no doubt seen Justin Jackson’s excellent web site, <a href=\"http://justinjackson.ca/words.html\">Words</a>.  I loved it before I was half-way finished reading the whole way through.  The idea is powerful.  Words are powerful.  The web is powerful.</p>
<p>A few days later I saw Roman Schmitz riffing on the same idea with <a href=\"http://slopjong.de/words.txt\">words.txt</a>.  Roman ends with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Start with some initial words and continue with your fancy designs, responsive layouts, and scripts that do magical things.</p></blockquote>
<p>I loved this too.  There’s some excellent ideas in both pages, which I encourage you to read and ponder.</p>
<p>I want to say something about how these pages are constructed.  Earlier this year I had an interesting chat with David Ascher about what a modern web page is, and what it means to make something for the web.  We were doing planning work for Webmaker, and trying to think about what a person in 2013 needs to know and do in order to make something on the web.  David made the point that the web is no longer just HTML, CSS, and JS, but also metadata, analytics, APIs, and a host of other connective tissue beneath a skin of browser content.</p>
<p>Words and words.txt provide an interesting opportunity to explore this idea.  What is a web page in 2013, one that is intentionally stripped down, aware of itself, and trying to be nothing more than words?</p>
<p>We can’t do a pure diff of Words and words.txt, since the content isn’t identical, but if we did we see that Words is made of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>words</li>
<li>a doctype</li>
<li>a handful of HTML elements, including <code>html, head, meta, title, body, div, h1, p, strong, em, a</code></li>
<li>a few HTML entities for quotes</li>
<li>a dozen or so URLs</li>
<li>a tiny amount of CSS styling</li>
<li>a small script block with JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>What I find interesting is how Words situates itself within the web.  Because there is so little that isn’t words, it’s useful to consider what is there.</p>
<p>For one, there are links to two different social networks, Twitter and Google+.  It’s also interesting to look at that script.  This script, the so called <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/asyncTracking\">GA or Google Analytics script</a>, is so ubiquitous on the web, it’s almost not worth mentioning, and Justin doesn’t mention it.  I don’t say that because I attribute nefarious intentions to him; quite the opposite, I point it out because it’s so common now that you probably won’t visit many pages today that don’t also have it.  It’s simply become a de facto standard for making web pages.  Whether that’s good or bad is another discussion separate from the fact that it’s reality.</p>
<p>The web isn’t just HTML, CSS, and JS anymore.  The difference between Words and words.txt is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and <em>analytics</em>.  We don’t just write words on the web in 2013–we style them, lay them out, link them to other sites, and then <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115056462967470089501/posts/Ck215SzLx7Y\">watch and count people as they read them</a>.</p>
<p>In 2013, the web is words with awareness, words with analytics.</p>" nil nil "b6988c6885d031aeedad1ac2ac9e7914") (164 (20945 14374 604799) "http://christianheilmann.com/2013/06/29/in-praise-of-intelligent-paper-maps-map%c2%b2-on-kickstarter/" "Christian Heilmann: In praise of intelligent paper maps =?utf-8?B?4oCTIG1hcMKy?= on Kickstarter" "Chris Heilmann" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 23:52:58 +0000" "<p>I am currently in Barcelona, a gorgeous but quite confusing town.

<h3>Investigating SQLite Performance via Telemetry</h3>
<p>Years ago I tweaked our SQLite clients to use a larger page size. In my testing this seemed to achieve a speedup of 0.2-2x, see <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=416330\" title=\"Suboptimal SQLite page size\">bug 416330</a>. Unfortunately, ~30% of our users are still on the old page size (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=634374\" title=\"Fix page_size of WAL databases\">bug 634374</a>). We used a <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/jydoop\">jydoop</a> query to figure out if it’s worth developing a feature to convert these users over using two different (time spent <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/jydoop/blob/master/scripts/places4k.py\">reading</a> & time spent <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/jydoop/blob/master/scripts/places4k-slowsql.py\">executing</a> a query) ways to measure performance differences. According to both methods there is a 4x reduction in sqlite IO waits with the larger page size, so we’ll be adding code to convert people over more aggressively.</p>
<p>This was a cool investigation because it highlighted how much more confidence we have when making performance decisions now (due to telemetry) vs a few years ago.</p>" nil nil "b755e1c7aef30de349acf58c9d1d4e83") (160 (20945 14374 602625) "http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1610" "David Humphrey: Webmaker.org after 9 weeks, in 9 weeks" "david.humphrey" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 20:23:56 +0000" "<p>This week I spent a few days meeting with the Mozilla Foundation’s Webmaker engineering and design team in the Toronto office.  It was a great time of reflection after the <a href=\"http://www.cassiemcdaniel.com/blog/the-future-of-webmaking/\">past 9 weeks</a>, and a time to plan the next 9 weeks.  I left feeling like we’re on track, and excited about what’s next, and wanted to share some of my observations.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7321/9162209906_d5de301614.jpg\" title=\"Webmaker planning meeting at MoTo\" width=\"500\" /></p>
<p>For various reasons, our planning horizon has been, and continues to occupy a 9 week period.  Trying to forecast software projects beyond two months is fraught.  The team has really come together around a period of time that honours proper design-first development, and one that also gives engineers space to follow a rigorous process of review, iteration, and deployment (dev, staging, production).  Combining this with our ability to ship to users in short order (everyone on the team can ship, we have proper staging environments, push-button automated deploys, etc), I think the coming 9 weeks are going to be awesome in the way they let us move more quickly.</p>
<p>In order to launch the first iteration of the new <a href=\"https://webmaker.org\">webmaker.org</a>, we had to bring up 5 new apps all at once, with various dependencies between each.  This was hard to do in stages, and so we had to do a “1.0″ style release that happened all on one day.  Over the summer, this won’t be necessary, since we can now iterate on our platform, apps, and content in parallel.  Even weekly trains, as we did with Popcorn Maker in the early winter, feels too slow now, and we’ll be shipping multiple times a day going forward.</p>
<p>So what will we be shipping?  In the next 9 weeks, our goal is <strong>follow-through</strong>.  We shipped an MVP with the new webmaker.org, and we had, and have, many plans that go much further than what’s there now.  We’re ready to dive into some of these now.  At a high-level, this includes working toward shipping the following in the coming months:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webmaker Localization (l10n)</strong>:  I’ve <a href=\"http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1605\">already written about this</a>, and we remain bullish on localizing webmaker.org by the end of the summer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Ray Goggles:</strong> everyone who has ever used it loves this tool, and we do too.  <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875991\">Making it work in the new webmaker.org</a> is a high priority for us.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open MakeAPI to 3rd Party Users</strong>: we think the MakeAPI, with its idea of cataloging and making discoverable the things one makes, is useful beyond just working with our own tools.  We’ve already heard from 3rd party apps that want to use it, and we’re going to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=888285\">update it so this is possible</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on Mobile Experience:</strong> having webmaker.org work in mobile and be more responsive, is something we’re excited to do.  We’ve already started in this direction, and plan to make it better and better as the summer unfolds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Webmaker Mobile Web App:</strong> we also want to try our hand at creating a new Webmaker tool specifically for mobile, and geared to allowing users to publish to the MakeAPI more seamlessly.  This is at the early design phase, so I won’t anticipate direction by saying more.  What I can say is that we’re planning to leverage the open web platform (hi there, Firefox OS!).  I know Cassie, Kate, and others will have more to say on it soon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improve makes.org:</strong> the user publishing makes.org domain is one of our most loved features in the new site, and we have plans to take it further, adding things like user profile pages, better page and URL naming, analytics, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Media Sync</strong>: making on the web means using a variety of services, tools, and publishing platforms.  Users of the web know that one doesn’t use just a single site or work only using one account or identity.  With webmaker.org, we want to make it possible to more easily access and use the disparate bits one has created across the web.  We’d like to allow users to access their work on YouTube, Flickr, SoundCloud, etc., and use it to make and remix new work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI and UX Improvements in our Tools:</strong> we have lots of ideas to improve how our existing tools work, make them more fun and easier to use.  Some of these are small and others will take many weeks.  Watch for things to evolve.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scripts in Thimble:</strong> we’ve been working hard toward allowing our users to safely include JavaScript in their published makes for some time.  Doing this properly has meant a bunch of engineering work in our publishing code, and we’re still putting the final touches on it.  But we’re really close, and I know Pomax is currently getting the final pieces in place.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content, Content, Content:</strong> the new webmaker.org is built around content and enabling newer and better content types is something we’re already working to do.  Additionally, we have UI changes that we need to ship to make this content easier to find and remix</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tutorials:</strong> our current solution for tutorials is really a first effort at an MVP.  There’s a lot more we can do, and figuring out how to do them well is on our list.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to some of these big ticket things, there’s a host of other work that will occupy us as we go forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying down technical- and design-debt</li>
<li>Creating a Style Guide for our UI and UX</li>
<li>Creating Documentation for ourselves and users</li>
<li>Doing more User Testing</li>
<li>Figuring out how to do proper QA and User Support</li>

<a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone</a> which I’ve decided to port to <a href=\"http://angularjs.org/\">Angular</a>.  The reasons why are largely beside the point of this

Backbone seemed to be confusing me more than helping me, and Angular got a
<em>lot</em> of good press at <a href=\"http://fluentconf.com/fluent2013\">FluentConf</a> this
year.</p>
<p>So this morning’s task in <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/commits/feature/angular\">the re-write</a> was to
re-hook up the <a href=\"https://login.persona.org/about\">Persona</a> integration.  I had
read recently that when you had a lot of dom-manipulation functions, you should
probably put that code in a directive, and since I hadn’t written an Angular
directive yet, I figured this would be a great time to learn how.  Writing <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/blob/feature/angular/views/index.html#L30\">the
html</a>
was pretty easy, of course, and most of the code from the existing
implementation (which was largely based on the code from the <a href=\"https://github.com/jbuck/express-persona/blob/master/README.md\">express-persona
readme</a>) could
be ported over fairly quickly.  The only tricky part I ran into was figuring
out that I needed to include <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/angular-tools/blob/master/persona.js#L36\"><code>restrict: 'E'</code></a> in the
<a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive#directivedefinitionobject\">Directive Definition Object</a>.  After I
was done, I noticed that there really wasn’t that much in the code that had
anything to do with the tool I’m writing, and thus I pulled it out into a
separate repo so that other people can use it.</p>
<p>And with that, I announce <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/angular-tools/\">Angular-Tools</a>, a repo containing one or more tools

ads because of third party cookies, and in general about the lack
of privacy on the internets</p>
<p>I made the decision to not depend on a couple of big companies
anymore for all my data in the cloud and to pay for the services
I really needed & use the proper Firefox addons to cut down
on the ads.</p>
<p>I slowly moved away from Google.</p>
<p>I moved to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.newsblur.com/\">NewsBlur</a>
instead of Google Reader - before Reader was planned to be stopped.</p>
<p>I moved from Gmail to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://fastmail.fm\">fastmail.fm</a>. That was the
hardest one because I was on Gmail since 2004. Fastmail, it turns
out, has its servers in the U.S. too, but I guess having a
separate service for my e-mails is breaking the all-things-at-google
scheme. I am also trying to have my network use PGP when we exchange
e-mails, so they're stored encrypted on those servers I don't own.</p>
<p>Last, I moved from the Google search engine to DuckDuckGo, then
to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://startpage.com/\">StartPage</a>. The latter gives better
results than DuckDuckGo in general because it's a proxy on the
top of Google search engine. It just secures your privacy and
unlike DDG, you won't get <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/privacy\">Amazon referral links in your results</a>  I'd rather pay a yearly
rate at DDG rather than this referral system.</p>
<p>Anyways, I kept my Google account for two reasons: redirecting mails
to my fastmail account and using Google+ because I like this service
a lot. The redirection is not important anymore. After over a year of
redirection - people should know how to reach me :)</p>
<p>I also had Facebook to stay connected with my non-geek friends
mostly. I also use Twitter a lot.</p>
<p>However, the recent privacy scandals made me think a bit about
how I use all these services.</p>
<p>First of all, G+ and Facebook provide features to share <strong>privately</strong>
some data to a specific set of people. We've seen that our privacy
is not guaranteed. They'll give your data away if they're asked.</p>
<p>And well, they are commercial companies that need to sell ads,
so your private content is used anyways. Just look at the ads that
are displayed besides your e-mail when you use GMail.</p>
<p>So while there's an incentive to let you share data thinking
it's not public, shit happens. So I don't see the point of pushing
anything non-public in those silos. And it turns out that I am mostly
a consumer. Too bad G+ is a private club and you can't see its
content if you don't have a Google account.</p>
<p>If I have cool stuff to talk about, I can blog and probably
do a better job in one blog post than in numerous G+ or FB posts.</p>
<p>Twitter on the other hand, is mostly shouting out in public your
opinions, promoting your projects. I barely use the DM feature.</p>
<p>Twitter is not different of course from Google & Facebook - they
need to sell ads and your data is used for this, but at least it's
easier to control that you're only pushing public stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Given all of this, I have deleted my Google and Facebook accounts yesterday</strong></p>
<p>(well, for FB unfortunately I reactivated it today because I lost
access to my Spotify Premium account - so until this is solved, my FB
is still active but it's a matter of days.)</p>
<p>All of this if of course is the tip of the iceberg since we eventually
found out that governments can just extract content from the flow that
goes through undersea cables.</p>
<p>But what I am doing is still important. It's a political act that will
shape the future if we're a bunch of people acting like this.
We need to show through our online habits and actions that we care about
our privacy.</p>
<p>On the phone side, I guess I am in a pretty good shape since I use Firefox OS.
The only part that worries me now is the hardware.</p>
<p>Now my next task is to teach my kids how important privacy is, so that they
clearly understand what's going on when they are using the internets.</p>" nil nil "0122eaa06623e9a0a727e46c2ba305b1") (154 (20941 34153 179621) "http://blog.seanmartell.com/2013/06/27/rebuilding-a-simplified-firefox-logo/" "Sean Martell: (Re)building a simplified Firefox logo" "mart3ll" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 18:51:39 +0000" "<div class=\"top-image-1129\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-0.png\" width=\"500\" /></div>
<p>Today we are excited to announce a visual evolution of our Firefox brand that will better fit its extended usage beyond that of a desktop web browser. An overview of our brand history and the reasons for this evolution are <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/creative/?p=138\">covered on our Creative blog</a>, so this article will have a brief look at the previous version and then dive into the various visual changes we’ve made with the new design.</p>
<h3>What was new is now old</h3>
<p>The 2009-2013 Firefox logo is an amazing piece of artwork. That launch visual evolution focused on creating a refined visual element that spoke to the power and newness of the browser – a beautiful asset for a beautiful product. I use that logo every day in my work, and thanks to the Mozilla brand guide and assets repository, more and more people are using it as well. </p>
<p>Through my work and interacting with others who used it in video, print and web, it has become clear that though beautiful, the artwork does come with a few usage concerns like SVG compatibility and color consistency. We’ve listened to feedback over the years and documented these examples. Now, with the desire to reshape the look to reflect our brand evolution, this is the perfect time to step back and solve these issues.</p>
<div class=\"large-image-1129\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"657\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-4.png\" width=\"992\" /></div>
<h3>Make the logo simpler</h3>
<div class=\"large-side-1129\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-2.png\" width=\"300\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~smartell/blog/20130627/1129-3.png\" width=\"300\" />
<div class=\"callout-1129\">Simplifying a style doesn’t always mean bringing it down to basic geometric shapes and solid colors.</div>
</div>
<p>Simplifying a style doesn’t always mean bringing it down to basic geometric shapes and solid colors. You can in fact bring simplicity to a visual by better balancing color, contrast, shape, and detail. To that last point, we removed quite a bit of detail in this latest revision but purposely added more detail where needed to accommodate today’s high resolution screens. The simplification process not only focused on the look but also the structure by making it SVG compatible and more accessible for the broader Mozilla community.</p>
<p>The first step in the rebuild was to go in and strip out all the detail that was using blend mode layering such as multiply, screen and overlay – mostly found in the tail area <span class=\"point-1129\">1</span>. As stated, a key goal of the redesign was to make it work flawlessly in SVG as well as open up the possibility to rebuild all the internal structure using SVG and CSS gradients. Having reduced the logo down to its shape-tweaked forms <span class=\"point-1129\">2</span> and softer gradients, we continued to remove any detail we thought wasn’t critical to the overall image. This tied into another goal of having the image hold up with greater clarity at smaller sizes.</p>
<p>Once we had removed a fair amount of detail in the logo, it was time to look at introducing enhanced detail where it would be needed when scaled to larger sizes. Stephen Horlander recreated all the continents <span class=\"point-1129\">3</span> on the globe with high resolution displays in mind and we paired those with a removal of the high gloss <span class=\"point-1129\">4</span> to create a softer, deeper color globe. Combining these deeper blues with now lighter oranges in softer detailed fur <span class=\"point-1129\">5</span>, we achieved that greater contrast that would create better separation of the elements at all sizes.</p>
<p>A final touch that you may notice in the new logo (and one that makes me very happy) is the arm of the fox now extends from a shoulder instead of layering behind his chest <span class=\"point-1129\">6</span>. It’s a small detail, but it really seems to unify the form of the fox and make him feel more cohesive a brand element.</p>
<p>So there it is. Not a logo redesign, but a simplification in form and function. We hope you are as excited about the new look as we are about using it!

"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 10:43:00 +0000" "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">We use Mercurial to manage the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla source tree</a>. Locally I use the Mercurial Queues (mq) extension to manage my patch queue. Mq keeps a stack of patches and provides commands (qnew, qpush, etc.) for applying, updating, and managing patches. The patches are kept in a 'patches' subdirectory in the project's .hg directory. Also in that directory are two files of meta-data - 'status' and 'series'. The former is binary data and keeps track of which patches are currently applied. The latter is text and contains an ordered list of your patches. By fiddling with the 'series' file you can manually add, remove, and re-order patches in a queue.<br /><br />I have several real and virtual machines with multiple copies of the tree on each (not always the same tree - moz-central vs inbound, for example). Keeping the patches in sync is a pain. I have to do this when testing on different platforms and when landing patches (moving from my dev tree to my clean clone of inbound). One solution is creating a user repo in the patch queue. You can then manage your queue as another repo. This is nice because you get history and can wind back mistakes, as well as backup and synchronisation. However, it is a bit cumbersome. I would prefer something more convenient for syncing between repos on the same and different machines. So, I thought what if I could use Dropbox to sync the patch queues? After all for keeping files in sync, Dropbox is as convenient as it gets. It turns out to be not that easy because Dropbox will not sync files outside of the Dropbox directory and hg will not allow you to use any directory other than '.hg/patches' for your patch queue. Furthermore you can't just use a symlink because you really don't want to synchronise the 'status' file, only the patches (and Dropbox will not exclude files). (Sometimes I want to synchronise the 'series' file, and sometimes not).<br /><br />My solution is to patch the mq extension to allow specifying the path to patches and the meta-data files (yay for open source!). I can then set up symlinks from the subdirectories to my Dropbox directory and we're good to go. The path is to patches is fairly well hard coded into the extension, I couldn't find a way to refer to a completely different directory, which would mean not needing the symlinks. The syncing between repos is not quite real-time, it only happens when I qrefresh, but that's as good as it can get, really. I have to be a bit careful to keep the repos at similar ages so that the patches cleanly apply. Which patches are actually applied is also not synced, so I have to manually track that. And even if a patch is synced, it is not automatically re-applied to the tree. I have to do a manual qpop/qpush. Still, I think this is a real improvement on my workflow. It also means it is easy for people to see what I'm working on in almost real-time, which is pretty cool.<br /><br />If you use qqueue to manage multiple patch queues, this technique should work cleanly with that. Each queue will need a subdirectory for each named path you specify. Each can be symlinked to a different directory in Dropbox or wherever.<br /><br /><b>Instructions</b><br /><br />If you want to set up something like this yourself, you will need to:<br /><br />grab the mercurial source<br />grab my patches<br />apply them<br />build mercurial<br />set up symlinks<br />configure mq<br /><br />Start by cloning the <a href=\"http://selenic.com/hg\" target=\"_blank\">hg repo</a> (I guess we could use a source bundle, but we may as well get the bleeding edge). The easiest way to apply my patches is using a queue, so qinit in the new hg directory. Download and extract the <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74741329/hg/mq_paths.tar.bz2\" target=\"_blank\">patches and series file</a> and un-tar into the hg patches directory. hg qpush -a.<br /><br />Then we need to build mercurial. On Linux this was easy, I needed to install the python-dev package and then just run 'make local' in the hg directory (I'm not going to install the new hg as the default one in case something breaks). Then pop an alias to the new hg in your .bashrc.<br /><br />Building and installing in Windows was much more of a pain, I think in part because I have a load of different versions of Mercurial installed in different places. Also I work half in real windows and half in the moz-build flavour of MinGW. Anyway, the following worked. More information <a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WindowsInstall\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/BuildingOnWindows\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br /><br />After cloning the hg repo, I installed a fresh version of MinGW (I had Python, and I guess its headers). I had to explicitly add '/c/MinGW/bin' or whatever to my PATH (export PATH... in MinGW, not the system-wide Windows version). Then I ran 'python setup.py build --force -c mingw32' from the MinGW console (this failed from the windows command prompt, even after playing with the path environment variable). I then manually copied all the .pyd files from 'hg\\build\\lib.win32-2.7\\mercurial' to 'hg\\mercurial' (where 'hg' is where I cloned hg to). Then I created an alias to the new version of hg similarly to on Linux.<br /><br />Next the symlinks. Actually, it turns out you can't use symlinks (on Linux ), because hg throws a hissy fit because \"security\". But you can use mount - 'mount -o bind $target $link' where target is inside dropbox and link is inside .hg/patches. You can put the mount in your /etc/fstab to re-mount on startup.<br /><br />On Windows use 'mklink /J $link &target'. Note the order of link and target is reversed (compared to mount on Linux) and that you will have to use '\\' not '/'. This only works in the windows command propt, not the MinGW console.<br /><br />Finally you need to configure mq. You do this by editing the hgrc file in the projects '.hg' directory (I guess you could use your ~/.hgrc file (Mercurial.ini on Windows) if you want to use the same sub-paths for all your repos, but I didn't). Add an mq section, you can then set 'seriespath', 'statuspath', 'patchespath', and 'guardspath' to add a sub-path for the various kinds of files. Any kind you don't specify a path for gets put in the usual place (.hg/patches). For example,<br /><br />[mq]<br />seriespath = shared<br />patchespath = shared<br /><br />will result in your patches and series file ending up in '.hg/patches/shared' and your status file in '.hg/patches'. (This is what I do for most of my repos, for some I don't specify seriespath so I can do different things there).<br /><br />Note: sometimes on Windows (never Linux, which is why I haven't fixed this) I see an error message when doing 'hg qnew'. But the patch gets created just fine, so it seems to be fine to ignore this.<br /><br />Finally, if you would like to see what I am working on, you can find my patches <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74741329/ncameron.org/patches.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</div>" nil nil "038a50daeb5984c18865e8a9c5e8b58b") (152 (20941 30430 986601) "http://michellethorne.cc/2013/06/making-a-difference-by-making-the-web/" "Michelle Thorne: Making a difference by making the web" "thornet" "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 10:19:10 +0000" "<p>These days, with all the Prism/Tempura surveillance we’re learning about, <strong>one can feel quite powerless.</strong></p>

<h3>A Third Way: Teach the Web</h3>
<p>We believe in <strong>user empowerment that balances free expression online with a respect for user privacy.</strong></p>
<p>We want to help people take control of their digital lives—and <strong>foster a user-centric web.</strong> We can <a href=\"http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html\">rebuild the web we lost</a>.</p>
<p>To get there, we <strong>need to help people discover the joy of making things on the web.</strong> It’s important to show that the web is not a scary place. It is fun and useful to participate online while still controlling your data. This is a valuable lesson and one that should trump flashy apps or simple convenience.</p>
<p>I’d like to share some stories about <strong>people who volunteer to <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106022863174952221205\">teach the web</a>.</strong> Be it in their homes, their neighborhood shops, their city squares, or wherever, these are real stories about people who want to empower users of the web.</p>
<p><strong>It’s grassroots, it’s modest, but it’s a start.</strong></p>
<h3>Teach your family</h3>
<p><strong>Activism starts at home.</strong> You begin with the people you care about, the people closest you.</p>
<p>Like the <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Convince-Your-Parents-to-Let-You-Download-Firefox\">activists who install Firefox for their friends and families</a>, <strong>teaching the web at home doesn’t cost anything and is sustainable.</strong> You don’t have to worry about big budgets or outreach. Just help the people in your living room.</p>
<p>This is Unnati, a 14 year-old webmaker. Under the mentorship of <a href=\"http://trendsincomputer.blogspot.de/\">Gauthamraj</a>, she’s gone from learning about the web to teaching it. At home, she’s taught her mother and father how to make the web. And now this year, bolstered by her new confidence in teaching, she’s organizing a <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/events/55\">bigger event in her city</a>.</p>

<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2314\" height=\"782\" src=\"http://michellethorne.cc/wp-content/uploads/ertops-e1372411424696.jpg\" title=\"ertops\" width=\"550\" /></p>
<h3>Teach the teachers</h3>
<p>Once you’ve taught your family and your neighbors, the next step is to <strong><a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/05/webmaker-train-the-trainer/\">teach other people how to teach the web.</a></strong> This means helping others develop techniques and tools that they can use to teach their family and neighbors.</p>
<p>This step is harder, but ultimately very powerful. <strong>It can increase the impact of grassroots engagement by an order of magnitude.</strong></p>
<p>Lawrence and San James organized their <strong><a href=\"http://www.newslibre.com/news/webmaker-mentor-training-kampala/\">first “train the trainer” event in Kampala, Uganda.</a></strong> They wanted to host a multi-stop webmaking tour to local schools, and in order to teach all those students, they needed more mentors.</p>
<p>Using techniques from <a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/05/webmaker-train-the-trainer/\">our training in Athens</a>, Lawrence and San James successfully mentored 40 new teachers. Lawrence noted, “It didn’t feel like a training but like a collaborative exchange of knowledge and ideas on hacking the web.”</p>
<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2317\" height=\"359\" src=\"http://michellethorne.cc/wp-content/uploads/train-the-trainers-kampala-e1372412408842.jpg\" title=\"train the trainers kampala\" width=\"540\" /></p>
<p>To scale these efforts even more, we launched an online training/collaboration called <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/\">Teach the Web</a>. With nearly 6,000 participants, and despite <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/teachtheweb-so-you-want-to-run-a-cmooc/\">all the associated challenges of coordinating and mentoring so many people</a>, it was incredibly rewarding to find so many kindred spirits who care about making the web.</p>
<p>These are stories from the participants in this course. <strong>And there are many more.</strong></p>
<h3>The Web is made by people</h3>
<p>As the first iteration of the #teachtheweb course comes to a close this week, we’re asking ourselves: <strong>what next?</strong></p>
<p>There are a several promising opportunities. Several mentors are <strong><a href=\"https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/articulos-weblitstd/\">localizing the course</a></strong> and will run the it again in different languages, including Spanish, French and hopefully others.</p>
<p>We’d also <strong>like to repeat the course,</strong> rolling in <a href=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/teachtheweb-so-you-want-to-run-a-cmooc/\">what we learned this time around</a>. Likely, the course will be shorter (3 weeks instead of 9) and perhaps involve more tools than just webmaker ones.</p>
<p>I’d also love to see <strong>more resources on how to teach privacy.</strong> I whipped up a <a href=\"https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/lh00/\">prototype to teach encryption</a>, using material from the EFF. But there’s a lot more we can do to make these topics approachable, fun and easy to learn.</p>
<p>As we look to what else we can do, how we can promote a third way of online participation, I’m reminded of a story <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/113905697837976594807/posts\">Jeannie</a> told. She was helping a young learner make his first website. After publishing on the web, something clicked for him. <strong>He said, “Wow, so if I can make and share something on the web, does that mean that everything on the web is made by people?”</strong></p>
<p>Yes, yes it is. And we can do our part to help more people not be intimated or indifferent about the web, but <strong>instead to make things together and celebrate our shared, connected humanity.</strong></p>

This post is a reflection on the meta structures and processes that created the experience. <strong>It's also only <em>mildly</em> reflective of the learning that occurred.</strong> <strong>These observations completely delude the very human and personal feelings I have towards the #teachtheweb community and all the individuals within it. </strong><em>[Update: Luckily, <a href=\"http://michellethorne.cc/2013/06/making-a-difference-by-making-the-web/\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle nails the human side of this story in her post.</a>]<strong>
</strong></em>
Although this post is going to sound a bit academic, a couple of my colleagues are going to be writing about the amazing stories and community members that made <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb</a> so incredibly awesome. And I'm sure I'll have more to say about my newly expanded <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Personal learning network\">personal learning network</a> and the KICK ASS MOZILLIANS who participated in #teachtheweb.
<h3>After #teachtheweb, I'm working under two assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are lurkers in this community.</strong> Lurkers are reading, looking, observing, maybe even making things, but they're not sharing in this community, or they're not sharing often.</li>
<li><strong>Activity fluctuates.</strong> Some people have time for #teachtheweb all at once or in spurts. Others take a certain amount of time each week. Some people dip in only on certain topics, others are fairly constant throughout.</li>
</ul>
[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<img alt=\"\" class=\" \" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ShZp9A2.png\" width=\"500\" /> Well, we didn't have at least one person from EVERY country, but...[/caption]
<h3>And three absolute certainties:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our metric overview is flawed.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter much because people are definitely learning together.</li>
<li><strong>#teachtheweb is an unmitigated success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Metrics and Multiple Channels</h3>
In the #teachtheweb experience, we have multiple channels where people can participate, so we have multiple channels to collect metrics from. Unfortunately, <strong>collecting accurate metrics is next to impossible</strong> for a couple of reasons:
<ol>
<li>We didn't get Analytics onto the <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb site</a> until AFTER the first week (oops.)</li>
<li>The sign up mechanism is connected to <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">webmaker.org/teach</a>, but signing up is not required for participation because everything is open. We cannot differentiate between traffic from participants and traffic from people who never signed up.</li>
<li>People don't always tag their stuff. Sometimes there are typos (e.g. #teactheweb).</li>
<li>We encouraged self created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/zythepsary.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al0Wg7eR7tHcdDRGVEJCMEFXbmRwV3RUamhHRVlfRHc#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">Study Groups</a> (not oops, but a fail if we're talking about metrics). Study Groups may be using other hashtags and special lists. There are several untrackable study groups using private groups, communities, forums, email, etc.</li>
<li>We are sure to miscount membership. There's members vs active members vs people who are also members of the main G+.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Data Viz</h4>
Finding better ways to collect metrics and share them as data visualizations would up participation. When people feel like they're alone in their learning experience, they're much more likely to reserve their participation until others join them. People are hungry for social learning experiences, and data viz is an easy way to show learners that they're not alone.
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://infogr.am/teachtheweb-27148\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"490\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uiZjlxS.png\" width=\"500\" /></a>Here's a shoddy infographic on #teachtheweb.</p>
<h3>Community and tiers of engagement</h3>
At the beginning of #teachtheweb, we talked about three levels of engagement. These levels may eventually be associated with Mozilla Mentor Badges.
<ol>
<li><strong> Mentor-in-Making (level 1)</strong> Be explicit about the agency people have over their own learning by helping them understand there are no deadlines, responsibilities, or criteria for participation. Give them permission to work at their own speed. People aren't used to this. For someone to move from a Mentor-in-Making level to Mentor, <strong>community at higher levels need to serve as examples</strong> in the way they moderate and mentor. The progression to Mentor is extremely transient – Mentors-in-Making who are enthusiastic about their learning will undoubtedly make resources or run events that fulfill the criteria for the Mentor badge.</li>
<li>
[caption id=\"attachment_1929\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"100\"]<img alt=\"Mentor Badge\" class=\" wp-image-1929    \" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mentor-badge-150x150.png\" width=\"100\" /> Mentor Badge[/caption]
<strong>Mentor (level 2)</strong> Progression happens when Mentors-in-Making begin to mentor their peers and creating new open educational resources or run in-person events that teach openness and web skills. <strong>Celebration of participation at this level is as important as participating itself.</strong> The more interaction the typical learner receives from the community and moderators, the more they participate. Helping mentors understand their own agency in this process is very important as well. Advancing through the tiers of engagement requires people at higher engagement levels actively monitoring and mentoring in the various channels and being examples for their peers. Peer to peer learning and support is integral to sustaining the community. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/introducing_mentor_badges\" target=\"_blank\">We've launched this level</a> as the <strong>first Mozilla Webmaker Mentor Community badge</strong>. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/mentor\" target=\"_blank\">Apply for your Mentor badge!</a></li>
<li><strong> Super Mentor (level 3)</strong> Inspiring people to advance to Super Mentor status requires a personal touch and an ambient personification of open values. Again, celebration from the community as well as core staff is massively important. At the highest level, the community is looking for collaborators, mentorship and advice from the \"experts\" in the field. Finding ways to connect Super Mentors with Mentors is important for the cross over from Mentor to Super Mentor. Super Mentors are linked to sustained contribution – be it creating resources for someone else to teach with, running events or mentoring others. <strong>We'll be figuring out more succinct criteria and issuing for the Super Mentor Badge in the coming months.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Moderation + Mentoring</h4>
<strong>Be open from the get-go.</strong> Asking active community members to moderate and mentor potential community members displays trust, which leads to empowerment. <strong>A mistake to avoid</strong> is trying to select only certain community members to contribute to the planning and moderation of the online learning experience. Instead, certain community members should receive personal outreach and asks, but the community as a whole should receive an invitation to contribute.
<h3>Content Creation</h3>
<a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/planning/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Planning #teachtheweb\">Asking for \"braindumps\"</a> was a great way to get a lot of different ideas, but we may have gotten more contribution had we prepared more topic specific questions that helped people formulate their thoughts around base ideas. Keeping the it in an open form, like <a href=\"http://etherpad.mozilla.org\" target=\"_blank\">Etherpad</a>, allowed people to riff off each other's ideas, which made it easier to find patterns and threads.
However, content contributions dropped steadily throughout the nine weeks. Here's a graph:<img alt=\"contentcontributors_graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1924\" height=\"394\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contentcontributors_graph.png\" width=\"498\" />
<strong>It's draining to do active engagement while concurrently creating content.</strong> Because active conversation needs to take place if we want people to move up the tiers of engagement, preparing content and content creation mechanisms in advance is recommended. This procedure can, in and of itself, be an outreach method and works well under specific deadlines.
It might help to ask specific people to contribute to specific things based on interest and expertise. No amount of begging will help in the content creation department though, so <strong>be prepared to do the heavy lifting!</strong>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" height=\"738\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cfLzl5r.png\" />If we intend to do multiple initiatives like #teachtheweb, it would be useful to have a place where all this content can land. Wordpress might be the right technology, but our structure needs to change. Having better tools for filtering and connecting the <a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\">G+ Community</a> to the wordpress structure would be helpful. We might just need to take more time and more expertise setting up wordpress to be more user friendly for online learning.
The G+ firehose is also something to think about. <strong>There are pros and cons to using G+</strong>. For administration, there is no overview of G+, no substructuring, no archiving and it's difficult to find things (unless you know very specifically what something is called, who posted it, etc). It's a social network rather than a knowledge management system.
Additionally, despite attempts at categories, people don't tag and organize their own posts beyond the default stream. A more useful tool, in my view, would be some sort of a kick ass forum where everyone is together, could separate into groups within the structure, can tag, comment and share. <a href=\"http://discourse.org/\">Yes, I'm thinking something specific here.</a>
The facts that we've already built such a large community and that our potential community is likely already using G+ means that it would be difficult to move people from G+ to another system. However, it is something to consider.
If we intend to do multiple online learning experiences like teachtheweb, with a variety of audiences, topics and hashtags – we should think about modifying the existing system to <strong>make it easier for everyone to see what's happening in the community</strong> without having to invest the hours it would take to get an overview of this experience.
<h3>Duration & Modularity</h3>
Something that wasn't clear with the #teachtheweb online learning experience is that someone can join in any time. Advertising the experience as \"a nine week course\" was both true to form and misleading, particularly because we transitioned into <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/party\" target=\"_blank\">Maker Party</a> and aren't actually going anywhere.<strong> The only thing that's different now is that we won't send curated content every week.</strong> We're still active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> and in<a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\" target=\"_blank\"> the G+ community</a>.
Instead of having new topics each week, we might think about having monthly themes. It's lower bar than a 9 week collection of topics, but it means we'll have various groups dipping in and out of content.
<strong>#teachtheweb had a comparatively low attrition rate.</strong> In #teachtheweb approximately 18% of participants were still active in the final week.<strong> This is pretty awesome</strong>, considering that the average MOOC has less than 10% of participants in the final week*. This data is mostly speculative because I didn't really take the time to do full analysis week by week of participants and their online actions. I just compared share and tweet numbers between Week 1 and Week 8, if someone wants to do a full analysis, let me know, and I'll share the data I have :)
If we're going to run varying lengths and varying content, we should think about finding a way that this form of work can always tie together, yet stand alone. It has a lot to do with the tiers of participation, and the technology we use to post this content.
<h4>Time Boxing Pros and Cons</h4>
<div style=\"width: 53%; float: left; margin-right: 1em;\">
<strong> Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>lots of excitement and involvement right away</li>
<li>easy to set a rhythm for production, meetings, etc</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style=\"float: left; width: 44%;\">
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>people think it ends and, therefore, don't sign up if they feel they are late</li>
<li>no room for schedule shifts</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Subversive engagement + humor</h3>
Finding ways to joke and play in an online space like #teachtheweb seems really important. Experimenting with subversive +mentioning in G+, random tweeting at people and sharing relevant but goofy things from across the web helps with keeping contribution up. It might not seem like something you need to plan for, but it actually is. Finding humorous and relevant shares and/or makes can be time consuming.
<h3>Making</h3>
<a href=\"https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-make-a-kit-template/remix\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/images/assembly_thumb.png\" width=\"150\" /></a>We launched the <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">hackable templates</a> through #teachtheweb. We launched dirty prototypes, and people took them and used them in ways we'd never imagined. These templates have already become staple in Mozteach content. They continue to be an extremely successful model for Mentor content creation.
<strong>Make stuff.</strong> Give optional readings. Maybe some videos. But <strong>focus on making stuff.</strong> No discussion to be had. Inspire people to make and then be blown away by what happens.
<h3>Tell Me Stuff</h3>
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this post and am happy to answer questions. It's a long post, but could have been much longer.

<p>Today we are excited to announce a visual evolution of our Firefox brand that will better fit its extended usage beyond that of a desktop web browser. An overview of our brand history and the reasons for this evolution are <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/creative/?p=138\">covered on our Creative blog</a>, so this article will have a brief look at the previous version and then dive into the various visual changes we’ve made with the new design.</p>
<h3>What was new is now old</h3>
<p>The 2009-2013 Firefox logo is an amazing piece of artwork. That launch visual evolution focused on creating a refined visual element that spoke to the power and newness of the browser – a beautiful asset for a beautiful product. I use that logo every day in my work, and thanks to the Mozilla brand guide and assets repository, more and more people are using it as well. </p>
<p>Through my work and interacting with others who used it in video, print and web, it has become clear that though beautiful, the artwork does come with a few usage concerns like SVG compatibility and color consistency. We’ve listened to feedback over the years and documented these examples. Now, with the desire to reshape the look to reflect our brand evolution, this is the perfect time to step back and solve these issues.</p>

<p>Simplifying a style doesn’t always mean bringing it down to basic geometric shapes and solid colors. You can in fact bring simplicity to a visual by better balancing color, contrast, shape, and detail. To that last point, we removed quite a bit of detail in this latest revision but purposely added more detail where needed to accommodate today’s high resolution screens. The simplification process not only focused on the look but also the structure by making it SVG compatible and more accessible for the broader Mozilla community.</p>
<p>The first step in the rebuild was to go in and strip out all the detail that was using blend mode layering such as multiply, screen and overlay – mostly found in the tail area <span class=\"point-1129\">1</span>. As stated, a key goal of the redesign was to make it work flawlessly in SVG as well as open up the possibility to rebuild all the internal structure using SVG and CSS gradients. Having reduced the logo down to its shape-tweaked forms <span class=\"point-1129\">2</span> and softer gradients, we continued to remove any detail we thought wasn’t critical to the overall image. This tied into another goal of having the image hold up with greater clarity at smaller sizes.</p>
<p>Once we had removed a fair amount of detail in the logo, it was time to look at introducing enhanced detail where it would be needed when scaled to larger sizes. Steven Horlander recreated all the continents <span class=\"point-1129\">3</span> on the globe with high resolution displays in mind and we paired those with a removal of the high gloss <span class=\"point-1129\">4</span> to create a softer, deeper color globe. Combining these deeper blues with now lighter oranges in softer detailed fur <span class=\"point-1129\">5</span>, we achieved that greater contrast that would create better separation of the elements at all sizes.</p>
<p>A final touch that you may notice in the new logo (and one that makes me very happy) is the arm of the fox now extends from a shoulder instead of layering behind his chest <span class=\"point-1129\">6</span>. It’s a small detail, but it really seems to unify the form of the fox and make him feel more cohesive a brand element.</p>
<p>So there it is. Not a logo redesign, but a simplification in form and function. We hope you are as excited about the new look as we are about using it! Enjoy!</p>" nil nil "3584d9d9263cc363e291e8d031e2b826") (147 (20941 17502 41567) "http://mozillamcoates.blogspot.com/2013/06/fighting-good-fight-direction-for.html" "Michael Coates: Fighting the Good Fight =?utf-8?Q?=E2=80=93?= A Direction for Mozilla to Lead the Open Web" "Michael Coates" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 16:38:00 +0000" "<div class=\"MsoNormal\">Mozilla found its way over ten years ago when       we saw the web       spiraling into peril. The web was stagnating, it was controlled,       and users had       no choice or voice in the future of the web. Here began Firefox, a       collective       effort where individuals around the world could contribute and       build the web       that they wanted to see. Fast-forward and we now see a healthy web       where       competition in browsing options spurs advancement and growth. </div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">But the web is transforming again. The battle       is not for       what browser you chose to use at your desk, but the entire       ecosystem that       powers the computer in your pocket. Not unlike the monopoly we saw       years ago       that stifled the web, we are now watching a distinct divide being       built in       mobile. This divide isolates users and forces them to choose which       part of the       web they want to live in. Developers can no longer just build for       the web;       instead they must build for each device a user brings to the web,       undermining       the very unity that made the web successful.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">Today Mozilla fights for mobile. To liberate       users from       closed ecosystems and enable developers to build for the web in       whatever shape       it is accessed – be that from desktop or mobile devices. We are       bringing       technologies that have powered the web into the foundation of a       mobile operating       system. This is combined with a design that enables developers to       use the       technologies they know and that have powered the web to easily       build powerful       mobile apps. We see a future of the web where mobile is not       different from the       web, only a different size serving different needs of the user. In       the end, the       technologies that power the web should be harnessed to also power       the web       experienced on mobile.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">But while we focus on the battleground of today       we must also       look forward to see what is next. The future always seems distant       until it is       right upon you. Mozilla must continue to be competitive so that we       can fight       for the users and be a driving force in the open web. We must look       past the fog       of today’s concerns to prepare for how to guide and shape the web       in the next       major phase. We’ve seen the web transform from something accessed       purely by a       desktop device to a mobile web that you carry with you in your       pocket. In       mobile, the web is where wherever the user goes, provided they       have their       device. But just as mobile has grown it too will one day yield to       the next       major shift of the web. I believe that shift will be to a user       centric web.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">A user centric web does not care what device       you use to       access the web. Desktop computer, mobile phone, tablet, TV screen,       car console,       wearable device and more - the web will be synonymous with the       user and the web       will follow the user wherever they go. Users will be less       concerned about       static web sites and apps, but more about their world, the way the       web       integrates into their daily lives and activities and every device       that the user       interacts with. To prepare for the next phase of the web Mozilla       must invest in       technologies that bring the web to the user regardless of their       device. The       center of the web will be the user.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">This requires a focus on identity, cloud, and       broadening the       reach of our platform. A user must be in control of their identity       on the web       with the ability to easily and seamless represent their identity       wherever they       may be. A user may have several devices they use often, but the       web will be       expected to function equally wherever they may be. To achieve this       Mozilla must       invest in cloud and creating a representation of a user, their       profile, their       identity and desires that is not tied to a particular device, but       rather to the       user directly. We also must continue to expand the platform to       other closed       ecosystems. Many companies will want to harness the web to attract       users, but a       closed ecosystem is an ecosystem that does not empower users and       rarely       represents the user’s desires and voice.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">The future is murky and can easily pivot at any       moment. The       choices of today’s technologies, many of which are heavily       debated, can greatly       influence what comes next. But if Mozilla is truly a leader of the       open web       then we must look past the obstacles of today and envision what       will come tomorrow.       Instead of waiting to liberate users from the next stranglehold,       let’s build       the foundation for the next phase of the open web. A web that       represents the       user, enables developers, and supports advancement in       technologies. </div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\">Mozilla was built on the power of a massive       worldwide       community that fought the good fight for no other reason than it       was the right       thing to do. Let’s look forward and prepare to lead what comes       next for the       web.</div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>mcoates</span></div><span>    </span><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>mozillian </span></div>" nil nil "800138f4eef9ca98a68abf2fcd50ce71") (146 (20941 17502 39789) "http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/teachtheweb-so-you-want-to-run-a-cmooc/" "Laura Hilliger: #teachtheweb: so you want to run a cMOOC" "Laura Hilliger" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 13:13:11 +0000" "<p><img alt=\"contentcontributors_graph\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contentcontributors_graph-150x150.png\" width=\"150\" /></p>The <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb</a> experience was about <a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\" target=\"_blank\">gathering people</a> together to learn and share and collaborate. It was about people who care about the web and web literacy and working together to find ways to spread skills to learners. This post is a reflection on the meta structures and processes that created the experience. <strong>It's also only <em>mildly</em> reflective of the learning that occurred.</strong> <strong>These observations completely delude the very human and personal feelings I have towards the #teachtheweb community and all the individuals within it.
</strong>
Although this post is going to sound a bit academic, a couple of my colleagues are going to be writing about the amazing stories and community members that made <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb</a> so incredibly awesome. And I'm sure I'll have more to say about my newly expanded <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Personal learning network\">personal learning network</a> and the KICK ASS MOZILLIANS who participated in #teachtheweb.
<h3>After #teachtheweb, I'm working under two assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are lurkers in this community.</strong> Lurkers are reading, looking, observing, maybe even making things, but they're not sharing in this community, or they're not sharing often.</li>
<li><strong>Activity fluctuates.</strong> Some people have time for #teachtheweb all at once or in spurts. Others take a certain amount of time each week. Some people dip in only on certain topics, others are fairly constant throughout.</li>
</ul>
[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<img alt=\"\" class=\" \" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ShZp9A2.png\" width=\"500\" /> Well, we didn't have at least one person from EVERY country, but...[/caption]
<h3>And three absolute certainties:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our metric overview is flawed.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter much because people are definitely learning together.</li>
<li><strong>#teachtheweb is an unmitigated success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Metrics and Multiple Channels</h3>
In the #teachtheweb experience, we have multiple channels where people can participate, so we have multiple channels to collect metrics from. Unfortunately, <strong>collecting accurate metrics is next to impossible</strong> for a couple of reasons:
<ol>
<li>We didn't get Analytics onto the <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb site</a> until AFTER the first week (oops.)</li>
<li>The sign up mechanism is connected to <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">webmaker.org/teach</a>, but signing up is not required for participation because everything is open. We cannot differentiate between traffic from participants and traffic from people who never signed up.</li>
<li>People don't always tag their stuff. Sometimes there are typos (e.g. #teactheweb).</li>
<li>We encouraged self created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/zythepsary.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al0Wg7eR7tHcdDRGVEJCMEFXbmRwV3RUamhHRVlfRHc#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">Study Groups</a> (not oops, but a fail if we're talking about metrics). Study Groups may be using other hashtags and special lists. There are several untrackable study groups using private groups, communities, forums, email, etc.</li>
<li>We are sure to miscount membership. There's members vs active members vs people who are also members of the main G+.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Data Viz</h4>
Finding better ways to collect metrics and share them as data visualizations would up participation. When people feel like they're alone in their learning experience, they're much more likely to reserve their participation until others join them. People are hungry for social learning experiences, and data viz is an easy way to show learners that they're not alone.
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://infogr.am/teachtheweb-27148\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"490\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uiZjlxS.png\" width=\"500\" /></a>Here's a shoddy infographic on #teachtheweb.</p>
<h3>Community and tiers of engagement</h3>
At the beginning of #teachtheweb, we talked about three levels of engagement. These levels may eventually be associated with Mozilla Mentor Badges.
<ol>
<li><strong> Mentor-in-Making (level 1)</strong> Be explicit about the agency people have over their own learning by helping them understand there are no deadlines, responsibilities, or criteria for participation. Give them permission to work at their own speed. People aren't used to this. For someone to move from a Mentor-in-Making level to Mentor, <strong>community at higher levels need to serve as examples</strong> in the way they moderate and mentor. The progression to Mentor is extremely transient – Mentors-in-Making who are enthusiastic about their learning will undoubtedly make resources or run events that fulfill the criteria for the Mentor badge.</li>
<li>
[caption id=\"attachment_1929\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"100\"]<img alt=\"Mentor Badge\" class=\" wp-image-1929    \" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mentor-badge-150x150.png\" width=\"100\" /> Mentor Badge[/caption]
<strong>Mentor (level 2)</strong> Progression happens when Mentors-in-Making begin to mentor their peers and creating new open educational resources or run in-person events that teach openness and web skills. <strong>Celebration of participation at this level is as important as participating itself.</strong> The more interaction the typical learner receives from the community and moderators, the more they participate. Helping mentors understand their own agency in this process is very important as well. Advancing through the tiers of engagement requires people at higher engagement levels actively monitoring and mentoring in the various channels and being examples for their peers. Peer to peer learning and support is integral to sustaining the community. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/introducing_mentor_badges\" target=\"_blank\">We've launched this level</a> as the <strong>first Mozilla Webmaker Mentor Community badge</strong>. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/mentor\" target=\"_blank\">Apply for your Mentor badge!</a></li>
<li><strong> Super Mentor (level 3)</strong> Inspiring people to advance to Super Mentor status requires a personal touch and an ambient personification of open values. Again, celebration from the community as well as core staff is massively important. At the highest level, the community is looking for collaborators, mentorship and advice from the \"experts\" in the field. Finding ways to connect Super Mentors with Mentors is important for the cross over from Mentor to Super Mentor. Super Mentors are linked to sustained contribution – be it creating resources for someone else to teach with, running events or mentoring others. <strong>We'll be figuring out more succinct criteria and issuing for the Super Mentor Badge in the coming months.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Moderation + Mentoring</h4>
<strong>Be open from the get-go.</strong> Asking active community members to moderate and mentor potential community members displays trust, which leads to empowerment. <strong>A mistake to avoid</strong> is trying to select only certain community members to contribute to the planning and moderation of the online learning experience. Instead, certain community members should receive personal outreach and asks, but the community as a whole should receive an invitation to contribute.
<h3>Content Creation</h3>
<a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/planning/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Planning #teachtheweb\">Asking for \"braindumps\"</a> was a great way to get a lot of different ideas, but we may have gotten more contribution had we prepared more topic specific questions that helped people formulate their thoughts around base ideas. Keeping the it in an open form, like <a href=\"http://etherpad.mozilla.org\" target=\"_blank\">Etherpad</a>, allowed people to riff off each other's ideas, which made it easier to find patterns and threads.
However, content contributions dropped steadily throughout the nine weeks. Here's a graph:<img alt=\"contentcontributors_graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1924\" height=\"394\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contentcontributors_graph.png\" width=\"498\" />
<strong>It's draining to do active engagement while concurrently creating content.</strong> Because active conversation needs to take place if we want people to move up the tiers of engagement, preparing content and content creation mechanisms in advance is recommended. This procedure can, in and of itself, be an outreach method and works well under specific deadlines.
It might help to ask specific people to contribute to specific things based on interest and expertise. No amount of begging will help in the content creation department though, so <strong>be prepared to do the heavy lifting!</strong>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" height=\"738\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cfLzl5r.png\" />If we intend to do multiple initiatives like #teachtheweb, it would be useful to have a place where all this content can land. Wordpress might be the right technology, but our structure needs to change. Having better tools for filtering and connecting the <a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\">G+ Community</a> to the wordpress structure would be helpful. We might just need to take more time and more expertise setting up wordpress to be more user friendly for online learning.
The G+ firehose is also something to think about. <strong>There are pros and cons to using G+</strong>. For administration, there is no overview of G+, no substructuring, no archiving and it's difficult to find things (unless you know very specifically what something is called, who posted it, etc). It's a social network rather than a knowledge management system.
Additionally, despite attempts at categories, people don't tag and organize their own posts beyond the default stream. A more useful tool, in my view, would be some sort of a kick ass forum where everyone is together, could separate into groups within the structure, can tag, comment and share. <a href=\"http://discourse.org/\">Yes, I'm thinking something specific here.</a>
The facts that we've already built such a large community and that our potential community is likely already using G+ means that it would be difficult to move people from G+ to another system. However, it is something to consider.
If we intend to do multiple online learning experiences like teachtheweb, with a variety of audiences, topics and hashtags – we should think about modifying the existing system to <strong>make it easier for everyone to see what's happening in the community</strong> without having to invest the hours it would take to get an overview of this experience.
<h3>Duration & Modularity</h3>
Something that wasn't clear with the #teachtheweb online learning experience is that someone can join in any time. Advertising the experience as \"a nine week course\" was both true to form and misleading, particularly because we transitioned into <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/party\" target=\"_blank\">Maker Party</a> and aren't actually going anywhere.<strong> The only thing that's different now is that we won't send curated content every week.</strong> We're still active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> and in<a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\" target=\"_blank\"> the G+ community</a>.
Instead of having new topics each week, we might think about having monthly themes. It's lower bar than a 9 week collection of topics, but it means we'll have various groups dipping in and out of content.
<strong>#teachtheweb had a comparatively low attrition rate.</strong> In #teachtheweb approximately 18% of participants were still active in the final week.<strong> This is pretty awesome</strong>, considering that the average MOOC has less than 10% of participants in the final week*. This data is mostly speculative because I didn't really take the time to do full analysis week by week of participants and their online actions. I just compared share and tweet numbers between Week 1 and Week 8, if someone wants to do a full analysis, let me know, and I'll share the data I have :)
If we're going to run varying lengths and varying content, we should think about finding a way that this form of work can always tie together, yet stand alone. It has a lot to do with the tiers of participation, and the technology we use to post this content.
<h4>Time Boxing Pros and Cons</h4>
<div style=\"width: 53%; float: left; margin-right: 1em;\"><strong> Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>lots of excitement and involvement right away</li>
<li>easy to set a rhythm for production, meetings, etc</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style=\"float: left; width: 44%;\"><strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>people think it ends and, therefore, don't sign up if they feel they are late</li>
<li>no room for schedule shifts</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Subversive engagement + humor</h3>
Finding ways to joke and play in an online space like #teachtheweb seems really important. Experimenting with subversive +mentioning in G+, random tweeting at people and sharing relevant but goofy things from across the web helps with keeping contribution up. It might not seem like something you need to plan for, but it actually is. Finding humorous and relevant shares and/or makes can be time consuming.
<h3>Making</h3>
<a href=\"https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-make-a-kit-template/remix\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/images/assembly_thumb.png\" width=\"150\" /></a>We launched the <a href=\"https://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">hackable templates</a> through #teachtheweb. We launched dirty prototypes, and people took them and used them in ways we'd never imagined. These templates have already become staple in Mozteach content. They continue to be an extremely successful model for Mentor content creation.
<strong>Make stuff.</strong> Give optional readings. Maybe some videos. But <strong>focus on making stuff.</strong> No discussion to be had. Inspire people to make and then be blown away by what happens.
<h3>Tell Me Stuff</h3>
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this post and am happy to answer questions. It's a long post, but could have been much longer.

I’ve been paying special attention to the time required to reach the “first paint” startup milestone: the point in time when the first Firefox window becomes visible.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The analysis has mostly consisted of profiling the latest Firefox Nightlies using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Performance/Profiling_with_Xperf\">XPerf</a> on a reference dual-core Windows 7 laptop with a magnetic HDD. I’ve been working on several bugs arising from the investigation (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881575\">bug 881575</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881578\">bug 881578</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=827976\">bug 827976</a>,  <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=879957\">bug 879957</a>, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=873640\">bug 873640</a>) and I have many more coming. This is an overview of a few challenges I’ve run into over the last month.</p>
<h3>Making Startup Times Reproducible</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wanted to evaluate the impact of my experimental code changes by comparing startups, but I quickly discovered that there is a tremendous amount of variation in startup times in my test environment. I then turned off <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefetcher\">Windows Prefetching</a> & <a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/windows-vista-superfetch-and-readyboostanalyzed,1532-2.html\">Windows SuperFetch</a>, two performance features responsible for pre-fetching files from disk based on the user’s usage patterns, but I still recorded excessive variation in start times.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I then turned off a plethora of 3rd-party and Windows services that were running in the background and accessing the disk: Windows Update & Indexing Service, OEM “boot optimizer” software, Flash & Chrome automatic updaters, graphics card configuration & monitoring software bundled with drivers, etc. After rebooting the laptop several times and disabling any remaining programs causing disk activity, I was finally able to achieve reproducible startup times. I expected that cold starts would be dominated by disk I/O, but I was suprised by just how heavily I/O operations dominated startup time in a vanilla Firefox install.</p>
<h3>Startup time has improved almost 30% over the last year</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In an attempt to reproduce the startup regression reported in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=818257\">bug 818257</a>, I compared time to first paint for Firefox 13.0.1 and Firefox 21.0 using my test setup. To my surprise, I found Firefox 21.0 (current release channel) requires roughly 4.6 seconds to reach first paint during cold starts, while Firefox 13.0.1 (release channel from a year ago) required ~6.4 seconds! This is almost a 30% reduction in startup time.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aq4ElA0owpEbdDhMNjh0V3pDT09Hck82UnZRaWJRTXc&single=true&gid=0&output=html\">See the raw results from 5 runs in a Google Docs spreadsheet here</a></p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was surprised by this result because I expected increases in code size and the overhead from initializing new components added over the course of a year to cause regressions in startup. On the other hand, many people have landed patches to improve startup by postponing component initialization and generally reducing the amount of work done before the first-paint milestone. I haven’t tried to identify the patches responsible yet, but from a quick look at the XPerf profiles for each version, it looks like there were gains from fixing <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=756313\">bug 756313</a>  (“Don’t load homepage before first paint”) and from changing the list of Mozilla libraries pre-loaded at startup (see <em>dependentlibs.list</em>).</p>
<h3>We are still FSYNC-ing too much at startup</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apparently, the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364439%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\">FlushFileBuffers</a> function on Windows causes the OS  to flush everything in the write-back cache as it <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ce_base/archive/2006/03/15/increasefsthroughput.aspx\">“does not know what part of the cache belongs to your file”</a>. As you can imagine, calling FlushFileBuffers is bad news for Firefox startups even it’s done off the main thread — other I/O requests will be delayed while the disk is busy writing data. Unfortunately we are currently calling this method on browser startup to write out the <em>webapps.json</em> file, the <em>sessionstore.js</em> file, and several SafeBrowsing files. The flush method isn’t being called directly, rather it’s the <em>SafeFileOutputStream</em> and <em>OS.File.writeAtomic()</em> implementations that force flushes for maximum reliability. In general, we should avoid calling methods that fsync/FlushFileBuffers unless such reliability is explicitly required, and I’ve asked <a href=\"http://dutherenverseauborddelatable.wordpress.com/\">Yoric</a> to change <em>OS.File.writeAtomic()</em> behavior to forego flushing by default.</p>

This work is technically part of the effort to make subframes asynchronously scrollable in OMTC, but it has helped us to fix other bugs as well. This post a braindump of the coordinate systems I've uncovered and the mental model I have.
<br />
<br />As of this writing, I have defined four \"pixel\" types in <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/Units.h\">layout/base/Units.h</a>. These are CSSPixel, LayoutDevicePixel, LayerPixel, and ScreenPixel. CSSPixel is the simplest - it represents a CSS pixel, which is what web content authors use to specify dimensions of things. Almost every Web API [1] deals with CSS pixels.
<br />
<br />In the days of yore, 1 CSS pixel corresponded exactly to one screen pixel. That is, when you created a div that was 50 CSS pixels wide, it would show up as 50 pixels wide on your screen. If you have a desktop monitor that is 1024 pixels wide [2] and you create a div that is 1024 CSS pixels wide, it takes up your entire monitor width. Makes sense, right?
<br />
<br />Now, let us enter the world of HiDPI display devices. On HiDPI devices, the screen pixels are so small and packed together so tightly that mapping 1 CSS pixel to 1 screen pixel doesn't make sense any more. Sure, you can fit more on the screen, but it's too tiny to be readable or useful. So we have this concept of a widget scale. The <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/xpwidgets/nsBaseWidget.cpp#l421\">nsIWidget::GetDefaultScale()</a> returns a scaling factor to account for HiDPI displays. For example, see the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/gonk/nsWindow.cpp#l557\">gonk implementation</a> which makes B2G perform a scale amount based on the actual DPI of the device. This introduces a new coordinate system that layout refers to as \"device pixels\" and what I've called LayoutDevicePixels.
<br />
<br />In the layout code, the widget scale affects two main things. One is the size of the CSS viewport [3]. If we have a widget scale of 2.0, then each CSS pixel is 2 screen pixels wide, which means that on a 1024x768 screen with a maximized browser window, you can only fit 512 CSS pixels across. So the CSS viewport width is adjusted to account for this. The other is the scale factor from app units [4] to screen pixels. Instead of the usual 60 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel you would normally get, setting a 2.0 widget scale results in 30 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel. This effectively makes each CSS pixel twice as wide when being rendered to the screen, which is the point of the whole exercise.
<br />
<br />But that's not all! There is another factor that comes into play between CSS pixels and LayoutDevicePixels, and that is the \"<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsPresContext.cpp#l1399\">full zoom</a>\". This is when, on desktop Firefox, you perform the \"Zoom In\" or \"Zoom Out\" actions. Doing a \"Zoom In\" action increases the full zoom, which works almost identically to increasing the widget scale. That is, setting a zoom of 110% is pretty much equivalent to having a widget scale of 1.1. The only difference I'm aware of is that if you specify your CSS dimensions in real-world units such as inches, then they are affected by the widget scale but not by the \"full zoom\". Tricksy!
<br />
<br />So to summarize what we have so far: in a world with just CSSPixels and LayoutDevicePixels, dimensions are specified in CSSPixels by content authors, and the browser maps them to LayoutDevicePixels based on the widget scale and full zoom. These LayoutDevicePixels are then displayed 1:1 on screen pixels as defined by the underlying platform.
<br />
<br />But what about mobile? Welcome to the land of OMTC and pinch-zoom. OMTC stands for off-main-thread compositor, and is what allows you to pinch a page on Fennec and have it instantly zoom. What's happening here is the painted page is transformed in OpenGL [5], without Gecko really knowing about what's going on. Since Gecko isn't repainting anything, this is super fast, and allows us to animate pinch-zoom at 60 frames per second (or close to it).
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, it also introduces a new coordinate system, because the LayoutDevicePixels that Gecko produced are no longer displayed 1:1 on the screen. Gecko could have painted something 10 LayoutDevicePixels wide (and so the texture uploaded to the graphics hardware would be 10 pixels wide) but then the user does a pinch-zoom and BAM! now it's taking up 20 pixels on the screen, because we told OpenGL to scale it up by 2x. So here we have our third pixel type defined: the ScreenPixel. In the preceding example the pinch-zoom produced a scale factor of 2.0 and so 10 LayoutDevicePixels would get mapped to 20 ScreenPixels.
<br />
<br />Now say you're viewing a page in Fennec and zoom in using pinch-zoom. And then you zoom in some more. And then some more. If all we did was take the LayoutDevicePixels and tell OpenGL to render them bigger by scaling it in hardware, you would end up with a very pixellated and blurry view of the page. In order to make it look good again, we have to go back to Gecko and tell it to repaint the visible area of the page at a higher density, allowing us to remove the OpenGL scaling. For example, instead of rendering a paragraph of text into a texture and scaling that up in OpenGL to display a single word really big, we can tell Gecko to just render that one word really big, and to use up the entire texture to do it. This is done by a call to <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsIPresShell.h#l1217\">nsIPresShell::SetResolution()</a>.
<br />
<br />Setting the resolution doesn't change our definition of CSSPixels or LayoutDevicePixels, but it does change something. To describe this change, we need to introduce a new coordinate system. This is the LayerPixel [6], and it sits between LayoutDevicePixel and ScreenPixel. That is, the resolution changes how many LayerPixels are produced for each LayoutDevicePixel, and now pinch-zooming affects the scale between LayerPixels and ScreenPixels. This is a little cyclical because as you perform a pinch-zoom, LayerPixels and ScreenPixels get farther apart in size. Then, once you finish the zoom, we tell Gecko to re-render the content at a new resolution such that LayerPixels and ScreenPixels are the same size once again, and we render the new LayerPixels at a 1:1 scale on the screen. When this happens the visible content goes from being blurry back to being sharp, which you can see in Fennec if you pay close attention when zooming in.
<br />
<br />So to summarize, here is what we have now:
<br />CSSPixel x widget scale x full zoom = LayoutDevicePixel
<br />LayoutDevicePixel x resolution = LayerPixel
<br />LayerPixel x OMTC transforms = ScreenPixel
<br />
<br />And so ends my braindump. Hopefully what I've written above will not change going forward, and the terms I've used can become part of the Gecko developer vocabulary, so that when dealing with code in different coordinate systems it's much easier to agree on what we mean.
<br />
<br />Notes:
<br />[1] <strike>The only exception I can think of is window.outerWidth, which is in screen pixels.</strike> (Edit 2013-06-27: I was wrong, I think outerWidth is also in CSS pixels.)
<br />[2] Note that the number of screen pixels displayed on a physical device may be modified by the operating system. For example, you can change your screen resolution from 1024x768 to 800x600, which changes the size and number of screen pixels. That's fine - we don't need to account for that in our code as the OS takes care of it.
<br />[3] The CSS viewport affects how wide the page is laid out by the layout code. One way of visualizing this is that if you have a page with just plain text, the text will be wrapped so that it doesn't exceed the CSS viewport width.
<br />[4] App units are what layout does all of its calculations in. One app unit is exactly one-sixtieth of a CSS pixel. The \"60\" was chosen because it has many integer factors and so allows representing common fractions losslessly.
<br />[5] The actual graphics system in use depends on the platform. OpenGL is just an example.
<br />[6] When Gecko paints the various elements on a page, it flattens them into \"layers\" that it hands off to the graphics stack. This is where the term LayerPixel comes from.</p>" nil nil "6b13122e4b1217987de2b13a4e1b0606") (143 (20940 21544 511623) "http://xulforge.com/blog/2013/06/android-in-4-easy-steps/" "Jorge Villalobos: Make your add-on support Android in 4 easy steps" "jorge" "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 14:25:50 +0000" "<p>As you may know by now, we’re running an add-on developer contest called <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/amp-your-firefox/\"><strong>Amp Your Firefox</strong></a>. We’re very excited about it and there are various categories you can compete in, but we <em>especially</em> care about the mobile categories. We want to grow our collection of <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/android/\">add-ons for Android</a>, so that Android users can enjoy the fully customizable experience that is Firefox.</p>
<p>I have been working on making many of my add-ons Android-compatible (alas, I don’t qualify for the contest, being both an employee and a judge!). So I wanted to give you a quick primer on how easy it is to convert add-ons or create new ones that work for Android, from the perspective of someone who has already worked on desktop add-ons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Add Android compatibility to your manifest.</strong> That means supporting <code><em:id>{aa3c5121-dab2-40e2-81ca-7ea25febc110}</em:id></code> in your target applications, and adding <code><em:bootstrap>true</em:bootstrap></code> to make it restartless.</li>
<li><strong>Set up your <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions\">bootstrap.js</a> script.</strong> This replaces a good chunk of your overlay. This script is responsible for setting up and then clearing any UI elements that you want to add, and running any startup scripts. The <code>chrome.manifest</code> file is loaded normally, so any additional XUL, locale files and CSS are also loaded. Keep in mind that add-on UI on Android is pretty much limited to the content area, but you can still load XUL pages using <code>chrome</code> or <code>about</code> URLs. XPCOM and JS Modules are pretty much the same.</li>
<li><strong>Set up your bootstrap.js script, like, for real.</strong> It’s likely you want your add-on to work both for Android and desktop, so your bootstrap script should handle multiple windows well and clean up after itself. <a href=\"http://www.oxymoronical.com\">Mossop</a> wrote a <a href=\"http://www.oxymoronical.com/blog/2011/01/Playing-with-windows-in-restartless-bootstrapped-extensions\">great post with sample code</a> you can reuse to make sure you’ve covered your bases during install, uninstall, and windows opening and closing.</li>
<li><strong>Read the docs!</strong> Should this be the first step? … maybe, what do I know. You can find everything you need here: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile\">Extensions for Android</a>. You’ll especially want to get acquainted with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile/API/NativeWindow\"><code>NativeWindow</code></a> object, for Android-specific UI, and the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile/API/BrowserApp\"><code>BrowserApp</code></a> object, which is sort of the replacement of the <code>gBrowser</code> object / <code><tabbrowser></code> element.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was surprised at how easy it was to create add-ons that work on Android, and to port some of the ones I had already created. Userscript-type add-ons work very well because they generally don’t need UI outside of the content, so porting my <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/AMO-Admin-Assistant\">AMO Admin Assistant</a> add-on was pretty much trivial. More UI-heavy add-ons like <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/Remote-XUL-Manager\">Remote XUL Manager</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/CTP-Manager\">Click-to-Play Manager</a> required more thought. They both open a XUL window, which I ended up converting into an <code>about</code> page in the mobile version. I also created the <a href=\"https://github.com/jvillalobos/Mobile-Installer\">Mobile Installer</a> add-on exclusively for Android, which is more of a sample add-on I made for a talk, but uses more of the Android-specific APIs in <code>NativeWindow</code>. It’s also a nice little tool that makes it easier to install XPIs after you’ve copied them to your device.</p>
<p>All of the add-on links above point to Github, in case you’re interested in looking at their code and using some of it on your own add-ons. I hope this motivates you to give Android add-ons a try, and step up to the challenge in Amp Your Firefox. All you need is to submit your entry and have your add-on approved on AMO to win an awesome t-shirt, so I really don’t know what additional motivation is needed <img alt=\";)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://xulforge.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> .</p>

It was about people who care about the web and web literacy and working together to find ways to spread skills to learners. This post is a reflection on the meta structures and processes that created the experience. <strong>These observations completely delude the very human and personal feelings I have towards the #teachtheweb community and all the individuals within it. It's also only <em>mildly</em> reflective of the learning that occurred.
</strong>
Although this post is going to sound a bit academic, a couple of my colleagues are going to be writing about the amazing stories and community members that made <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb</a> so incredibly awesome. And I'm sure I'll have more to say about my newly expanded <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Personal learning network\">personal learning network</a> and the KICK ASS MOZILLIANS who participated in #teachtheweb.
<h3>After #teachtheweb, I'm working under two assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are lurkers in this community.</strong> Lurkers are reading, looking, observing, maybe even making things, but they're not sharing in this community, or they're not sharing often.</li>
<li><strong>Activity fluctuates.</strong> Some people have time for #teachtheweb all at once or in spurts. Others take a certain amount of time each week. Some people dip in only on certain topics, others are fairly constant throughout.</li>
</ul>
[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<img alt=\"\" class=\" \" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ShZp9A2.png\" width=\"500\" /> Well, we didn't have at least one person from EVERY country, but...[/caption]
<h3>And three absolute certainties:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our metric overview is flawed.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter much because people are definitely learning together.</li>
<li><strong>#teachtheweb is an unmitigated success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Metrics and Multiple Channels</h3>
In the #teachtheweb experience, we have multiple channels where people can participate, so we have multiple channels to collect metrics from. Unfortunately, <strong>collecting accurate metrics is next to impossible</strong> for a couple of reasons:
<ol>
<li>We didn't get Analytics onto the <a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb\" target=\"_blank\">#teachtheweb site</a> until AFTER the first week (oops.)</li>
<li>The sign up mechanism is connected to <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/teach\" target=\"_blank\">webmaker.org/teach</a>, but signing up is not required for participation because everything is open. We cannot differentiate between traffic from participants and traffic from people who never signed up.</li>
<li>People don't always tag their stuff. Sometimes there are typos (e.g. #teactheweb).</li>
<li>We encouraged self created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/zythepsary.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al0Wg7eR7tHcdDRGVEJCMEFXbmRwV3RUamhHRVlfRHc#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">Study Groups</a> (not oops, but a fail if we're talking about metrics). Study Groups may be using other hashtags and special lists. There are several untrackable study groups using private groups, communities, forums, email, etc.</li>
<li>We are sure to miscount membership. There's members vs active members vs people who are also members of the main G+.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Data Viz</h4>
Finding better ways to collect metrics and share them as data visualizations would up participation. When people feel like they're alone in their learning experience, they're much more likely to reserve their participation until others join them. People are hungry for social learning experiences, and data viz is an easy way to show learners that they're not alone.
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://infogr.am/teachtheweb-27148\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"490\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uiZjlxS.png\" width=\"500\" /></a>Here's a shoddy infographic on #teachtheweb.</p>
<h3>Community and tiers of engagement</h3>
At the beginning of #teachtheweb, we talked about three levels of engagement. These levels may eventually be associated with Mozilla Mentor Badges.
<ol>
<li><strong> Mentor-in-Making (level 1)</strong> Be explicit about the agency people have over their own learning by helping them understand there are no deadlines, responsibilities, or criteria for participation. Give them permission to work at their own speed. People aren't used to this. For someone to move from a Mentor-in-Making level to Mentor, <strong>community at higher levels need to serve as examples</strong> in the way they moderate and mentor. The progression to Mentor is extremely transient – Mentors-in-Making who are enthusiastic about their learning will undoubtedly make resources or run events that fulfill the criteria for the Mentor badge.</li>
<li>
[caption id=\"attachment_1929\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"100\"]<img alt=\"Mentor Badge\" class=\" wp-image-1929    \" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mentor-badge-150x150.png\" width=\"100\" /> Mentor Badge[/caption]
<strong>Mentor (level 2)</strong> Progression happens when Mentors-in-Making begin to mentor their peers and creating new open educational resources or run in-person events that teach openness and web skills. <strong>Celebration of participation at this level is as important as participating itself.</strong> The more interaction the typical learner receives from the community and moderators, the more they participate. Helping mentors understand their own agency in this process is very important as well. Advancing through the tiers of engagement requires people at higher engagement levels actively monitoring and mentoring in the various channels and being examples for their peers. Peer to peer learning and support is integral to sustaining the community. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/introducing_mentor_badges\" target=\"_blank\">We've launched this level</a> as the <strong>first Mozilla Webmaker Mentor Community badge</strong>. <a href=\"http://blog.webmaker.org/mentor\" target=\"_blank\">Apply for your Mentor badge!</a></li>
<li><strong> Super Mentor (level 3)</strong> Inspiring people to advance to Super Mentor status requires a personal touch and an ambient personification of open values. Again, celebration from the community as well as core staff is massively important. At the highest level, the community is looking for collaborators, mentorship and advice from the \"experts\" in the field. Finding ways to connect Super Mentors with Mentors is important for the cross over from Mentor to Super Mentor. Super Mentors are linked to sustained contribution – be it creating resources for someone else to teach with, running events or mentoring others. <strong>We'll be figuring out more succinct criteria and issuing for the Super Mentor Badge in the coming months.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Moderation + Mentoring</h4>
<strong>Be open from the get-go.</strong> Asking active community members to moderate and mentor potential community members displays trust, which leads to empowerment. <strong>A mistake to avoid</strong> is trying to select only certain community members to contribute to the planning and moderation of the online learning experience. Instead, certain community members should receive personal outreach and asks, but the community as a whole should receive an invitation to contribute.
<h3>Content Creation</h3>
<a href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/planning/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Planning #teachtheweb\">Asking for \"braindumps\"</a> was a great way to get a lot of different ideas, but we may have gotten more contribution had we prepared more topic specific questions that helped people formulate their thoughts around base ideas. Keeping the it in an open form, like <a href=\"http://etherpad.mozilla.org\" target=\"_blank\">Etherpad</a>, allowed people to riff off each other's ideas, which made it easier to find patterns and threads.
However, content contributions dropped steadily throughout the nine weeks. Here's a graph:<img alt=\"contentcontributors_graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1924\" height=\"394\" src=\"http://www.zythepsary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contentcontributors_graph.png\" width=\"498\" />
<strong>It's draining to do active engagement while concurrently creating content.</strong> Because active conversation needs to take place if we want people to move up the tiers of engagement, preparing content and content creation mechanisms in advance is recommended. This procedure can, in and of itself, be an outreach method and works well under specific deadlines.
It might help to ask specific people to contribute to specific things based on interest and expertise. No amount of begging will help in the content creation department though, so <strong>be prepared to do the heavy lifting!</strong>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright\" height=\"738\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cfLzl5r.png\" />If we intend to do multiple initiatives like #teachtheweb, it would be useful to have a place where all this content can land. Wordpress might be the right technology, but our structure needs to change. Having better tools for filtering and connecting the <a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\">G+ Community</a> to the wordpress structure would be helpful. We might just need to take more time and more expertise setting up wordpress to be more user friendly for online learning.
The G+ firehose is also something to think about. <strong>There are pros and cons to using G+</strong>. For administration, there is no overview of G+, no substructuring, no archiving and it's difficult to find things (unless you know very specifically what something is called, who posted it, etc). It's a social network rather than a knowledge management system.
Additionally, despite attempts at categories, people don't tag and organize their own posts beyond the default stream. A more useful tool, in my view, would be some sort of a kick ass forum where everyone is together, could separate into groups within the structure, can tag, comment and share. <a href=\"http://discourse.org/\">Yes, I'm thinking something specific here.</a>
The facts that we've already built such a large community and that our potential community is likely already using G+ means that it would be difficult to move people from G+ to another system. However, it is something to consider.
If we intend to do multiple online learning experiences like teachtheweb, with a variety of audiences, topics and hashtags – we should think about modifying the existing system to <strong>make it easier for everyone to see what's happening in the community</strong> without having to invest the hours it would take to get an overview of this experience.
<h3>Duration & Modularity</h3>
Something that wasn't clear with the #teachtheweb online learning experience is that someone can join in any time. Advertising the experience as \"a nine week course\" was both true to form and misleading, particularly because we transitioned into <a href=\"http://webmaker.org/party\" target=\"_blank\">Maker Party</a> and aren't actually going anywhere.<strong> The only thing that's different now is that we won't send curated content every week.</strong> We're still active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> and in<a href=\"http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker\" target=\"_blank\"> the G+ community</a>.
Instead of having new topics each week, we might think about having monthly themes. It's lower bar than a 9 week collection of topics, but it means we'll have various groups dipping in and out of content.
<strong>#teachtheweb had a comparatively low attrition rate.</strong> In #teachtheweb approximately 18% of participants were still active in the final week.<strong> This is pretty awesome</strong>, considering that the average MOOC has less than 10% of participants in the final week*. This data is mostly speculative because I didn't really take the time to do full analysis week by week of participants and their online actions. I just compared share and tweet numbers between Week 1 and Week 8, if someone wants to do a full analysis, let me know, and I'll share the data I have :)
If we're going to run varying lengths and varying content, we should think about finding a way that this form of work can always tie together, yet stand alone. It has a lot to do with the tiers of participation, and the technology we use to post this content.
<h4>Time Boxing Pros and Cons</h4>

<strong> Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>lots of excitement and involvement right away</li>
<li>easy to set a rhythm for production, meetings, etc</li>

<h3>Subversive engagement + humor</h3>
Finding ways to joke and play in an online space like #teachtheweb seems really important. Experimenting with subversive +mentioning in G+, random tweeting at people and sharing relevant but goofy things from across the web helps with keeping contribution up. It might not seem like something you need to plan for, but it actually is. Finding humorous and relevant shares and/or makes can be time consuming.
<h3>Making</h3>

We launched dirty prototypes, and people took them and used them in ways we'd never imagined. These templates have already become staple in Mozteach content. They continue to be an extremely successful model for Mentor content creation.
<strong>Make stuff.</strong> Give optional readings. Maybe some videos. But <strong>focus on making stuff.</strong> No discussion to be had. Inspire people to make and then be blown away by what happens.

<p>So in what is probably a rather poorly kept secret I now no longer work for the Mozilla Foundation, in fact my last day was last week but in an attempt to stay ‘offline’ for a little while after that I’m only starting to look at the blogs and that kind of stuff again now. </p>
<h3>tl;dr</h3>
<ul>
<li>with everything that they’re doing, and everything not work related that I’ll now need to be doing it felt like a good time to go</li>
<li>not sure what the future hold yet – but let me know of anything interesting you have (rossbruniges at gmail dot com)</li>
<li>mozilla is a great place to work – I’m happy to have done so and hopefully left a good legacy of websites, standards and friends!</li>
</ul>
<p><span id=\"more-313\"></span></p>
<h3>But why?!</h3>
<p>I was there over 2 years and saw us grow from a team of roughly 15 (possibly not even that) to one that’s now well over 60 – it was quite and growth and it’s now quite a team but when I look at things it was a good time for me to go. At a time when they needed me at my very best I had <a href=\"http://www.thecssdiv.co.uk/2013/05/the-bad-week/\">too many external things happening</a> to also give them what I wanted, a lot of the sites that I made last year were in the process of being re-written and a couple of projects I helped get off the ground are now coming to a close; hopefully I’ve left a good stable launch pad for their next attack on making the next generation of webmakers.</p>
<h3>So what have I left behind?</h3>
<p>A lot of websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://mozillaignite.org\">Mozilla Ignite</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://mozillaopennews.org\">Mozilla Open News</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://www.thecssdiv.co.uk/source.mozillaopennews.org\">source.mozillaopennews.org</a></li>
<li><a href=\"https://gameon.mozilla.org\">GameOn (2012)</a></li>
<li>Mozilla Festival:
<ul>
<li><a href=\"http://mozillafestival.org\">Mozilla Festival (2012)</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://2011.mozillafestival.org\">Mozilla Festival (2011)</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>including a couple that are now no longer around (<a href=\"https://drumbeat.org\">mozilla drubmeat</a>) and the ‘old’ (or better sounding version 1.0) of <a href=\"https://webmaker.org\">webmaker.org</a>. I also contributed code to <a href=\"https://mozillalabs.com/projects/\">Mozilla Labs</a>, <a href=\"https://mozilla.org\">mozilla.org</a> and even removed a <blink> from <a href=\"http://myfavoritebeer.org/\">the very first demo-site showing Mozilla Persona</a>!</p>

<p>An office that hopefully will continue to hold awesome webdev events (I’ve hosted Djugl and LWS there in recent months), hackdays and Mozilla parties; and one that I’m looking to head back to for epic events soon.</p>
<h3>So what’s next?</h3>
<p>As of right now I don’t really have any future plans – no new job lined up and I’ve not put too much thought into where I go next; after a long time of work, work work I’m going to re-charge my batteries, get writing again and play around with a few things that I’ve yet to play with and be around for some people who could do with my help right now.</p>
<p>Saying that if you’ve got a cool job going or know of one then I’ve got time to meet up and talk so let me know – rossbruniges at gmail dot com</p>
<h4>Speaking opportunities?</h4>
<p>Something that has meant that I’ve not done as much of this as I would like is that it always takes me a while to write a talk – but I now have a bit of time, so if you want to hear me talk about things, how things work at Mozilla, working remotely, getting things done or anything else let me know – rossbruniges at gmail dot com.</p>
<h3>Is Mozilla still a good place to work at?</h3>
<p><strong>YES</strong> – and they’re hiring so head over to <a href=\"http://careers.mozilla.org/#sections\">careers.mozilla.org</a> and see what is there. There are coding jobs but also account manager, project and events manager roles and if you love the web and want to work with other people who do then this is an awesome, challenging but also rewarding place to be. I you want to ask about any of the roles please feel free to get in touch and I’ll see what I can say and try and put you in touch with the right people. But the very best thing you can do is apply – that’s what I did over two years ago and it was a great ride from then on.</p>
<p>They say ‘once Mozilla, always Mozilla’ – and I’m proud to be able to be included in that collective now.</p>" nil nil "fbd6c13d91b43df4276f9e9f92693990") (139 (20940 7891 24806) "http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2013/w3c-webdriver-face-to-face-june-2013.html" "David Burns: W3C WebDriver Face To Face - June 2013" nil "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 09:19:32 +0000" "<p>A couple weeks ago was the latest face to face of the W3C Browser Automation (WebDriver) Working Group.

The purpose of the event was to generate ideas, topics and hot issues that should drive different themes and tracks at the upcoming Mozilla summit.<br /><br />The planning event was organized as an \"unconference\". There were many merits to the open nature of this approach. It surfaced important issues and gave flexibility for the day to focus on important issues on people's minds. However, I would encourage those that are leading an unconference event to set a bit of high level context. Free flowing structure is great, but a little bit of overall goal setting is also a good complimentary item.<br /><br />During the event I led two micro sessions on topics that were important to me. The first sessions was \"Building a Framework for Decision Making at Mozilla\". This micro session was merged with another related topic suggested by Jishnu titled \"The Nature of Dissent\". The micro session was well attended with a lot of great ideas. More to come on this over the coming weeks. I'm planning to work with the team to flush out the framework and present at brown bags leading up to the summit.<br /><br />The second microsession was centered around understanding the end user when designing security and privacy features. A strong point that was raised during this micro session was the idea of identifying the user types, their desires for greater security controls, and the types of trade offs they may be interested in making (if any) for these additional features. The main point was that an understanding of the target audience is required when building additional features and security & privacy features are no different here. We have more work to do on this topic, but there's a lot of valuable information that can come from this.<br /><br />The next steps after the summit assembly are to continue working with group leads to flush out the various summit tracks. Much more information to come. But based on the energy and enthusiasm at the assembly planning event I think we're going to have a fantastic Summit in just a few months.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: small;\"></span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: small;\">--<br /></span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span>mcoates</span></span><span> </span><br /><span>mozillian</span>" nil nil "7bea6d628478cf5bbaa14e9b08945976") (137 (20939 63888 226733) "http://globau.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/happy-bmo-push-day-52/" "Byron Jones: happy bmo push day!"

"selena" "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 23:29:22 +0000" "<p><em>This is a lightly edited version of an email I sent to pgsql-hackers today.</em></p>
<p>Josh Berkus asked:</p>
<p><strong>> How should reviewers get credited in the release notes?</strong></p>
<p>Without getting into how the community might decide to do this, I thought it might be helpful to share the reasons why I believe recognizing and expressing gratitude to reviewers is a helpful, useful and gratifying exercise for the Postgres community.</p>
<p>I support crediting reviewers in a more formal way than we currently do for a few different reasons.</p>
<p>First, I believe it’s worth finding a way to say “Hey, you just did something great for Postgres”, publicly, to a bunch of people who could have spent their valuable time and energy in some other way.</p>
<p>Second, reviewers get better at their work by reviewing multiple times – so I’d like to encourage people to review more than once.</p>
<p>Third, reviewers don’t always need to be expert developers, or experts at Postgres to get started, but many people who do open source work have no idea this is true. Public recognition helps make it clear that we have people who give useful reviews and are relative novices.</p>
<p>We also have several different kinds of reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>“does it compile”</li>
<li>style/typo/easily seen bug passes</li>
<li>in-depth discussion of design choices, use case, interface</li>
<li>complex testing cases</li>
<li>performance testing</li>
<li>pre-commit checks for more subtle bugs or committer preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those, except probably the very last, can be done by people who are familiar with Postgres or its configuration, but aren’t necessarily Postgres or C experts.</p>
<p>Fourth, we have very few accepted ways to recognize contributions to Postgres. Naming in Release Notes is one way this community has consistently supported as a <em>public</em> way to say “hey, you just did something great for Postgres”. The complete list of ways I’m aware of are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recognizing major, minor and emeritus contributors</li>
<li>Making someone a committer</li>
<li>Being part of the -core group</li>
<li>Naming authors by name in commit messages (but without consistent metadata, making it difficult to count well)</li>
<li>Naming authors in release notes</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s pretty much it. That’s great for the people who have already secured positions through seniority, or because they’re amazing C hackers. I don’t know if I need to lay out for everyone the value of public recognition – if you want me to I can enumerate them. But the benefits of public recognition are huge — both in a social and a financial sense.</p>
<p>Currently, the only way I know of to be recognized for work on Postgres that is <em>not</em> seniority or code-related is #1. If you’re a reviewer, there’s almost no chance you’ll be recognized in our list of contributors without some additional, very significant contribution to our community. (Please let me know if I’m mistaken about this — I only know what I know!) Adding names to Release Notes (or some variant of Release Notes) seems like a minor concession for work that we as a community need, value and want to encourage.</p>
<p>We are so few in terms of patch contributors – somewhere between 300-400 people contribute code to PostgreSQL each year based on the names I try to pull out of commits. I haven’t counted how many reviewers we have who do not also contribute patches separately.</p>
<p>Giving people appreciation for the review work they’re doing, for free, is a good thing for everyone. Naming more names helps describe the true scope of our community. Spreading gratitude is good for those who thank and those who receive thanks (like, proven scientifically!). And we increase the number of people who benefit directly from the work that they do here, by giving them something they can point their boss, their company and their colleagues to.</p>
<p>So, when we’re debating <em>how</em> recognition might be done, please don’t lose sight of <em>why</em> this is important in the first place.</p>" nil nil "4dc0fefccbb58fa11254c3247473436f") (135 (20939 63888 224929) "http://work.erikvold.com/pathfinder/2013/06/26/introducing-addon-pathfinder.html" "Erik Vold: The Add-on Pathfinder" "Erik Vold" "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "<p>I took all of my Jetpack modules and put them in the <a href=\"https://github.com/erikvold/addon-pathfinder\">Add-on Pathfinder</a>.</p>
<h3>Add-on Pathfinder</h3>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>I’ve created this repository for a lot of reasons, and that is always the best one. It’s not worth going through them all however, so here are the ones worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the Add-on SDK needs a place where people can contribute to experimental modules rapidly, this means everything should happen on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a>, tests are optional, and auto-repacks are not an issue. I don’t think the SDK should become this, in my eyes the SDK should be the land of stable modules, and Pathfinder would be a land of experimental or nearly stable modules.</li>
<li>I feel I do my best work in a bottom-up design approach, which is how I see Pathfinder growing, I see the SDK as being developed in the opposite manner which has merits as well, such as stability. I am just one person tho and stability is just not something that I can offer for my range of modules, so I don’t feel that is the right approach for me. Teams have much greatly ability to offer stability.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>APIs will change in the Pathfinder, modules may move around too, be forewarned!</p>
<p>When this happens I will blog about it, and I’ll probably start a wiki page about this kind of thing too so that everyone has a reference that they can check.</p>
<p>Documentation badly needs updating..</p>
<p>I’m telling you all about Pathfinder now, despite the obvious need of work because I have abondoned the old repositories, and fixed many bugs in Pathfinder already which I have no intention of back porting.</p>
<h4>Modules</h4>
<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/erikvold/addon-pathfinder\">Add-on Pathfinder</a> is a collection of modules which include, in no particular order:</p>

The project has done a reasonable job at this so far with respect to this. We check if items are in the DOM, we check the visibility of items and we normalise text from the browser, amongst our other amazing talents!
</p><p>Our default position is we enforce the idea of emulation. \"How would a user do this action?\" is the main question we ask ourselves! So when a bug that doesn't meet that we tend not to implement it. One of these times is bug 141 - WebDriver lacks HTTP response header and status code methods. This is one of the most contentious bugs in the Selenium repository. People see Selenium as more than browser automation library, they see it as a web testing framework. Yes, Selenium RC was like this but then again Selenium RC also had ~140 methods hung off one object. We made a mistake in the past, let's try not to repeat it! Anyway, I digress,  in a web testing framework world there may be times where there are use cases where you need to find out data from the response header and status codes.
</p><p>So is this a feature we want to add to WebDriver? No. \"But David, we do!?!?!?\" I hear you cry! The use case that comes up regularly is I want to know if a server is returning a 404 or 500 when I access a page. Why is there a need to start a browser to find this out? When I asked this question on twitter, my friend and fellow committer Kevin Menard said that it could be useful to to see the page response on failure and some pages can only be accessed with a real browser. The use cases that Kevin had is you want to check that the endpoint that you originally hit might might change based on the user agent passed in or there might be a site that follows the single page idea and breaks push state and therefore most of the web semantics. I admit Kevin is right with those use cases. However its only looking at a small part of the issue and there are a lot of corner cases. The major one for me is watching XHRs. What if one of your XHR returns a 500 and you get an error? Should WebDriver show you that information as well? I am sure you can see how quickly this can escalate. If you start worrying about all requests, and you should if you are worried about the initial request to a page, then you want the browser to capture all of this information and return it in a standard format. There just happens to be a format called Http Archive (HAR).
</p><p>So does the project take the task of creating a mechanism for extracting a HAR from the browser? That could be near impossible on browsers that don't readily share network usage information. So we go from WebDriver being a browser automation framework for user emulation to browser automation framework for user emulation and networking information gathering. That might be a little obtuse but its meant to be.
</p><p>While Selenium's main use case is for test automation, is not solely designed for that. We want to be the best at browser automation. Proxies are really good at managing network information and reporting on it in standard formats. Examples are fiddler and browsermob-proxy. And you can even hook them into Selenium WebDriver! Like the following:
</p><p></p><pre class=\"brush: python\">from browsermobproxy import Server
server = Server(\"path/to/browsermob-proxy\")
server.start()
proxy = server.create_proxy()
from selenium import webdriver
profile  = webdriver.FirefoxProfile()
profile.set_proxy(proxy.selenium_proxy())
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile)
proxy.new_har(\"google\")
driver.get(\"http://www.google.co.uk\")
proxy.har # returns a HAR JSON blob
server.stop()
driver.quit()
</pre>
<p>Yes it might be a little verbose to use them but if you really want to see that type of information then you should do it properly otherwise the real errors, that you originally wanted, will go missing.
</p><p>Putting in half a solution into Selenium is just going to create scope creep and a large number of bugs because its not doing the \"right\" thing. The \"right\" thing is far too subjective for it to be done correctly.</p>" nil nil "7ee5aff8042c1e480b35cd3f55cb139c") (133 (20938 55084 353955) "http://oduinn.com/blog/2013/06/26/release-engineering-as-a-force-multiplier-at-google-techtalks/" "John O'Duinn: =?utf-8?Q?=E2=80=9CRelease?= Engineering as a Force =?utf-8?Q?Multiplier=E2=80=9D?= at Google TechTalks" "John" "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 08:31:51 +0000" "<p>I was super honored to present as part of the Google TechTalks series.

I've never been passionate about being a people manager, and I've always looked to reduce or eliminate that part of my role, but our pace of hiring always outstripped my ability to send my direct reports to other managers. Lately that's changed, partly because our hiring has slowed in the areas I touch, but also because we have more and better managers in the platform team to take up load.

</li></ul>
<p>Over the coming weeks I’d like to introduce some of the key concepts as well as some of the issues that need your input.</p>
<p>First, I’d like to give an overview of where the spec comes from and what it covers.</p>
<h3>Why Web Animations? A summary of happenings until now</h3>
<p>On the Web today we have <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/\">CSS Animation</a> (including <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/\">Transitions</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html\">SVG Animation</a> and they both have their problems. For example, CSS is so simple it doesn’t even support synchronization and SVG is pretty hairy when it comes to interval negotiation and syncbase timing—and it’s SVG-only. Most of all though, they’re completely separate.</p>
<p>Also, Microsoft don’t support SVG Animation. They have consistently maintained that they want to see a single model for animation on the Web (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2011/03/02-svg-irc#T22-19-34\">minutes</a>) and that that model should have an API. That’s a very reasonable position in my mind, albeit frustrating for authors who want to use SVG Animation now.</p>
<p>The story since then is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>On several occasions throughout 2011 and 2012 I proposed various alternatives (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/F2F/Auckland_2011/Animation_improvements\">#1</a> – <a href=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/pres/SVG 2 Animation.html\">presentation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/F2F/Seattle_2011/Agenda/Animations/Harmonisation\">#2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/F2F/Sydney_2012/Agenda/Animations/WebAnimations\">#3</a>) for harmonizing the two such as importing SVG features into CSS and vice versa. People mostly just nodded in agreement and nothing happened.
</li><li>In January 2012, Adobe wisely suggested I <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2012/01/13-svg-irc#T23-14-43\">go away and prepare a concrete proposal</a> so people can get a feel for what is might look like. Adobe also offered to assist where they could.
</li><li>At the end of January 2012 I invited a contact from Google to join in since he had some great ideas about state machines.
</li><li>In March 2012 folks from Adobe, Google and I (Mozilla) got together in Tokyo and hacked out a first version of the spec.
</li><li>In May 2012 we <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fx/2012AprJun/0107.html\">got approval from the CSS and SVG working groups</a> to continue this work as an official work item.
</li><li>In September 2012 we presented a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvNQNtIfXXI\">demo of the work</a> at the <a href=\"http://svgopen.org/2012/\">Graphical Web conference in Zurich</a> (<a href=\"http://www.multimedia.ethz.ch/conferences/2012/svgopen/05-1_thursday?doi=10.3930/ETHZ/AV-f8a1c756-a4de-4e64-98f5-c2c0b90bc9af&autostart=false\">video recording</a>).
</li><li>In June 2013 we <a href=\"http://logs.csswg.org/irc.w3.org/css/?date=2013-06-04\">got approval from the CSS and SVG working groups</a> to publish a FPWD.
</li><li>Today (25 June 2013) we finally <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/\">published something</a>!
</li></ul>
<h3>What’s in the box?</h3>
<p>Basically, this:</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">
<img alt=\"Intersection of features provided by CSS, SVG, and Web Animations\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/CSS-SVG-Web-Animations-500.png\" />
</div>
<p>Web Animations is essentially a common model for animation that underlies CSS and SVG. It covers the common features of both plus a few only found in one or the other.</p>
<p>It also has a few extra features not currently found in either:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#grouping-and-synchronization\">Timing groups</a></dt>
<dd>This is the primary means of synchronization.<br />
It’s quite powerful but I’ll leave the details and justification for this to a separate post.</dd>
<dt>Speed control (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#speed-control\">#1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#timed-item-speed-control\">#2</a>)</dt>
<dd>This is a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/SVG2_Requirements_Input#SMIL_time_manipulation_module\">requested feature for SVG2</a> and may be useful for achieving reversing effects such as exposed in CSS.</dd>
<dt><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#custom-effects\">Custom effects</a> (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#the-customeffect-callback-interface\">API</a>)</dt>
<dd>This allows the Web Animations timing model to be used to drive animations of HTML canvas etc. by registering a script callback.</dd>
<dt><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/#dfn-iteration-start\">Iteration start</a></dt>
<dd>This is a minor but much requested feature that allows you to start an animation part-way through its interval.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>What’s <em>not</em> included?</h3>
<p>Bear in mind that Web Animations is essentially a model. It’s not a declarative syntax. That’s something left to other specs. The API <em>happens</em> to be bundled with the model simply because that makes it easy to keep the two in sync.</p>
<p>The arrangement is as follows:</p>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">
<img alt=\"Intersection of features provided by CSS, SVG, and Web Animations\" src=\"http://brian.sol1.net/svg/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Animations-and-other-specs.png\" />
</div>
<p>The CSS-specific features required for CSS animations and transitions will be covered in a separate specification, possibly called “CSS Animations/Transitions level 4” which expresses its features in terms of the Web Animations model.</p>
<p>Likewise, current SVG features such as syncbase timing, or targetting attributes (not just CSS properties) will be covered by a separate specification (my next task) expressed in terms of that model. That specification may be called something like “SVG Animation” but I suspect not since quite a few people have expressed interest in allowing it to apply to HTML content too.</p>
<p>Other features that are not included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bounce/spring timing functions</strong> – we really wanted to make this possible and have a couple of simple extensions to timing functions to allow this but we haven’t yet reached agreement about which one is best so we’re leaving them both out for now.<br />
The plan is to follow up with a separate specification which provides additional timing functions anyway.<br />
(In fact, with the current working draft, you can’t even do more than one timing function over an animation currently but that will be fixed in the next draft when we introduce chained timing functions).<p></p>
</li><li><strong>Media integration</strong> – this is something a lot of people have been asking for but we decided to postpone it in the interests of progressing the spec along.<br />
The good news is this <em>used</em> to be part of the spec so we know it integrates very cleanly.<br />
For now we’ll work on it in a separate spec and if that comes along quickly enough we might merge it back in.<p></p>
</li><li><strong>State machines</strong> – this is something that is very useful when you start programming UI interactions but something we decided is not critical for the first version of the spec.<br />
Again, we’ll probably work on this as a separate spec.
</li></ul>
<h3>API?</h3>
<p>Originally I opposed the idea of adding an API because I think declarative solutions are generally preferable. However, the API is useful in a few cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>It lets you inspect the state of all animations in the document. Anyone can build developer tools that present you with a timeline of all the running CSS animations/transitions/SVG animations in the document for debugging.
</li><li>It lets you make runtime changes to declarative animations—for many apps a combination of declarative and procedural approaches is the best fit and lets you achieve effects that might not be possible using purely declarative features.
</li><li>For some problems a procedural approach is suitable and in those cases using the API is both simpler than writing the animation loop yourself and also means the browser can optimise the animation for smoother performance and less battery consumption.
</li></ul>
<h3>Implementations?</h3>
<p><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/blink-dev/web$20animations/blink-dev/jDjDMTuKegI/Uh1qz44DSBsJ\">Work has started on implementation in Blink</a> and is <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875219\">on the radar for Gecko</a>. Until then <a href=\"https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js\">a polyfill</a> is coming along in leaps and bounds and covers nearly all of the FPWD.</p>
<p>That’s it for now. I’ll follow up with posts explaining specific features and issues needing input but if you have any feedback on the spec, don’t hesitate to send it along to <a href=\"mailto:public-fx@w3.org\">public-fx@w3.org</a> with subject <q>[web-animations]</q>.

<p>The following is my personal take on (a small portion of) the Persona market strategy.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Persona’s #1 selling feature is privacy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This was a guiding <b>design principle</b>, no doubt about it. It <b>absolutely</b> is not our #1 <b>selling</b> feature.</p>
<p>Our team wants to help mainstream users. Sadly, privacy (and security) aren’t their main concern.</p>
<p>Johannes makes some great points around Google’s use of OpenID, that losing information about where their users are going might be a negative in evaluating Persona.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Our team has focused on the following stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Websites – Relaying Parties (RP)
</li><li>Email providers – Identity Providers (IdP)
</li><li>Browser Vendors
</li><li>People using the web (Users)
</li></ul>
<p>For each of these, deep focus was put into the value proposition and finding the right balance in the technical details.</p>
<p>I’ve never been on such a <b>large scale Open Source project</b> that focused on <b>User Centered Design, Marketing, and Security</b>.</p>
<p>Let’s take IdPs which is Johannes’ main problem. If an IdP were to adopt Persona, they would get the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizations have the ability to control the security parameters for their domain
</li><li>Brand recognition on websites which use Persona.
</li><li>A SSO-like experience for enterprise, schools, and communities.
</li></ul>
<p>Without native IdP support, an organization that controls an SMTP routable domain name is subject to the email + password of the Persona fallback. They cannot add 2 factor auth. By running an IdP they can use Yubi-keys, RSA thumbdrives, or SMS verification… whatever.</p>
<p>Once they control the security, they would be more inclined to use Persona across their family of websites. This integration is much easier than traditional methods and lowers expenses.</p>
<p>The brand recognition comes by controlling the login screen. They get this today with OpenID and OAuth which I will call “Social Login” to simplify the argument. Social Login isn’t applicable to every RP.</p>
<p>We think that adding <a href=\"http://www.guanotronic.com/~serge/papers/chi13a.pdf\" title=\"My Profile Is My Password, Verify Me!<br /> The Privacy/Convenience Tradeoff of Facebook Connect by Serge Egelman\">Facebook Connect filters out 15% of your new users</a>. (We’d love to do a study and get reliable numbers here).</p>
<p>There is a long tail of websites which can’t use Social Login and will do authentication themselves. We think that Persona is viable for many of these websites. Thus a company can further spread their brand.</p>
<p>I agree with Johannes that Google won’t be the first large IdP. I don’t think that means Persona is irrelevant or destined to fail. Universities, email providers, and enterprise can improve their users security and smooth out login flows. Identity startups can start with a solid protocol and get Browser/Website integration for free.</p>
<h3>The IdP is Only One Stakeholder</h3>
<p>Those reasons are just some of the value propositions balanced against other factors during the design of Persona’s BrowserID protocol.</p>
<p>For RPs, there is a set. Here are a couple:</p>
<ul>
<li>No platform/vendor lockin (email based)
</li><li>Easy to implement (lower cost)
</li><li>Works across devices
</li><li>Improves security (DROP COLUMN password)
</li><li>Consistent sign in across the web
</li><li>Lower cost of authentication system (forgot your password, remove sending email for verification and forgot your password, etc)
</li></ul>
<p>Again this list is non exhaustive and I haven’t touched upon Browser Vendor or User value propositions which have been designed for.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I agree with Johannes that some businesses will avoid Persona early on. Perhaps they want a Facebook Connect sign in for extended profile information and social graph.</p>
<p>That is fine.</p>
<p>Persona can help a lot of people use the web in an easy to use and more secure manner. It doesn’t have to be everybody on day one <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://ozten.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<p>Johannes, you have a long history in this space. From meeting you, I know you care about user sovereignty (and many other important factors). Thanks for helping us find adoption problems with Persona.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was told that, as a Mozilla employee, I could get a free <strong><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/\">Firefox OS</a></strong> phone. There were two caveats: it’s a developer preview, so it’s rough around the edges; and I’d have to ‘dogfood’ it – using it as my ‘daily driver’ and providing feedback to developers. I considered it for a while, flirted with the idea of an Android device, and then took the plunge last week. Since last Wednesday I’ve been using the <strong><a href=\"http://www.geeksphone.com/\">Geeksphone Keon</a></strong> as my main phone.</p>
<p><img alt=\"Firefox OS box\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36058\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ffos-box.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>Firefox OS is aimed primarily at the next billion web users, people who will experience the web for the first time through a mobile device. Instead of closed, proprietary platforms (or pseudo-open ones) the idea is that the entire ‘stack’ is open and easy to develop for. If you know HTML, CSS and JavaScript then you can create an app for a Firefox OS device. As someone who felt extremely empowered as a 16 year-old creating his first website, that’s something that certainly resonates with me.</p>
<p>Because of the aims of the Firefox OS ecosystem, the developer preview reference device (the Keon) is a pretty low-spec phone for 2013. The idea being, of course, that if an app runs smoothly on the reference device then it will run well on other devices. Although there’s some occasional lag, it’s a pretty slick experience – which makes me wonder what those quad-core beasts are doing with that extra processing power?</p>
<p>It would be disingenuous of me to pretend that the Keon does everything an iPhone or Android device does. Of course it doesn’t. I miss posting to Path, running with Nike+ and adding notes to Evernote. But to dismiss it based on current conceptions of what a mobile device should be would, I think, miss the point. It’s the first phone I’ve ever had that allows me to tick a ‘Do Not Track’ option, for example. <img alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" /> </p>
<p>This post is to ensure that you know someone who you can ask questions about Firefox OS. I’ll keep you updated as to my progress!</p>

<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two main use cases that asm.js addresses.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">The first is bringing full native applications to the Web.  Using a tool called <a href=\"http://emscripten.org\">Emscripten</a>, C++ code can be cross-compiled to JavaScript, specifically the asm.js subset.  It integrates well with existing tool chains, as we have demonstrated by porting <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/03/27/mozilla-is-unlocking-the-power-of-the-web-as-a-platform-for-gaming/\">Unreal Engine 3 to the web in 4 days</a>.  That’s an incredible achievement considering we ported over a million lines of code.  This accomplishment provides a smooth path towards publishing existing applications on the Web, or for treating the Web as a platform alongside traditional desktop and console targets.</p>

<p>Another route is using asm.js and Emscripten to port libraries that require significant computing power.  HTML5 game developers sometimes find it hard to achieve an acceptable user experience should they seek to include performance intensive elements such as physics or pathfinding in their game.  This often leads to developers needing to optimize every bit of their game just to get something workable.  asm.js makes including these intensive elements more practical.  You can now use an asm.js compiled library, such as <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/ammo.js/examples/new/ammo.html\">Bullet</a> or <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/box2d.js/webgl_demo/box2d.html\">Box2d</a> for physics, to supercharge the 5%-10% of the code that does most of the work and write the rest by hand using traditional JavaScript.  This approach gives you the speed of near-native execution where you need it and the ease and flexibility of modern JavaScript everywhere else.  Emscripten provides the needed capabilities for creating coder friendly interfaces for asm.js libraries to make them easy to interact with.</p>

<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is not limited to games.  The performance it can bring to web applications opens up many interesting possibilities for speeding up existing web tasks, or bringing new experiences to the Web.  Efforts to port video decoders and <a href=\"http://blog.bitops.com/\">photo processing tools</a> using asm.js are also seeing performance increases from taking advantage of existing C++ code without plugins or browser-specific technology.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">There have been several attempts to provide a solution for C++ developers wishing to target the Web.  We believe asm.js is the best solution, and here are a few of our reasons why:</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">1.  It’s just JavaScript.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is compatible with existing browsers.  Emscripten cross-compiled code requires Typed Arrays, a feature that is well-supported by modern browsers today, including Internet Explorer. There is no need to wait years for the technology to spread, or take the risk that it never will.  Furthermore, asm.js is a formalization of a pattern of JavaScript that web browsers have already been optimizing for, namely compiled C/C++ as generated by Emscripten and Mandreel, and a sample of that type of code appears in a popular benchmark, Google Octane.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">2. It’s fast.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to all of the work browsers have already done to optimize JavaScript in general and compiled C++ in particular (in part due to such code appearing in Octane), it is very easy for browser vendors to optimize for it and unlock its full potential — it took a single Mozilla developer about 3 months to implement <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Javascript:SpiderMonkey:OdinMonkey\">OdinMonkey</a>, our asm.js optimization module for Firefox.  Google developers also quickly achieved large speedups on asm.js, as reported in their <a href=\"http://news.softpedia.com/news/Chrome-May-Support-Mozilla-s-Asm-js-for-Native-Speed-Web-Apps-354281.shtml\">IO keynote</a>. In just a short time it is possible to get to about half the native speed of C++.  That’s faster than Java, in the case of Box2D.  That is just the first draft – we expect to get much closer to native performance with additional development on the browser side.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">3. It dramatically reduces the cost of supporting the Web.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">For developers already working with C++, Emscripten makes the Web just another port target.  Once it’s integrated into your tool chain, the web version can be recompiled alongside your other platforms whenever any updates are needed.  We have ported full properties in very short time periods.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">4. It reduces or eliminates the need for plugins.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">Companies that turn to plugins to enable their games or applications often see a significant friction in user adoption due to security warnings.  asm.js provides an alternative path that eliminates the security messaging issue while still providing much of the performance, all within a safe execution environment.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">5. It enables reuse of existing C++ libraries.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">There is a wealth of open source C++ libraries out there waiting to come over to the Web.  This is a vast amount of coding effort whose value has now been unlocked for web developers.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">asm.js is still a new technology, and we have plenty of work to do to provide its full potential to the developer community.  Mozilla is grateful to Epic and other game industry leaders that have already started to work on products using asm.js.  These early <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">examples</a> are helping to prove the value, shape the technology, and encourage other browsers to priorities optimizations for it.  The best way to help support the development of asm.js is to start using it and let us know what you think by adding comments to this post.  If you are a game developer or have a performance intensive application and choose to port it over, share your work with the world and let us know about it!</p>

I really love the orange colour though, somehow looks like it's made for the Dutch market already. Only 3 physical buttons, 1 power and 2 for volume. Furthermore the normal necessary things, microphone, speaker, headphone- and powerconnection.<br /><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sRvub1t1n2A/Ucl0Y8NjFyI/AAAAAAAAALI/YqMcGHIU4V0/s1600/20130624_185535.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sRvub1t1n2A/Ucl0Y8NjFyI/AAAAAAAAALI/YqMcGHIU4V0/s640/20130624_185535.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />So let's get started, where's the rest? Well, that's well hidden away in the triangular box behind the phone.<br /><br />All the things to get started and make the phone usefull, like battery, powercable, headphone, manual and some swag. The cover removes easily for placing the battery and I decided to place my SIM-card and SD-card too. All pretty well accessible.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCeeYz9EIi8/Ucl0ZCwEUcI/AAAAAAAAALc/embjeE5JNKg/s1600/20130624_190238.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCeeYz9EIi8/Ucl0ZCwEUcI/AAAAAAAAALc/embjeE5JNKg/s640/20130624_190238.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />So let's bring some live into this phone, power it up and hé, it starts immediately when pushing the power button. Apparently the battery was pre-loaded.

First impression is that responsiveness of the touchscreen is a little lame, but again I am used to a S2 which costs around €500, the Keon is for sale for €89. After a little swiping around I am quite impressed with the speed though.<br />Only 4 buttons on the home-screen, 1 screen to the left and 2 to the right.

And this cube opens up another triangular box which shows the phone as it is laying in a showcase.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p_QaH-NA2YM/Ucl0YAEQIFI/AAAAAAAAALE/7PZ7hnKGAQc/s1600/20130624_185134.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p_QaH-NA2YM/Ucl0YAEQIFI/AAAAAAAAALE/7PZ7hnKGAQc/s640/20130624_185134.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />First touch of the phone feels a bit heavy in spite of it's size. I really love the orange colour though, somehow looks like it's made for the Dutch market already. Only 3 physical buttons, 1 power and 2 for volume. Furthermore the normal necessary things, microphone, speaker, headphone- and powerconnection.<br /><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sRvub1t1n2A/Ucl0Y8NjFyI/AAAAAAAAALI/YqMcGHIU4V0/s1600/20130624_185535.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sRvub1t1n2A/Ucl0Y8NjFyI/AAAAAAAAALI/YqMcGHIU4V0/s640/20130624_185535.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />So let's get started, where's the rest? Well, that's well hidden away in the triangular box behind the phone.<br /><br />All the things to get started and make the phone usefull, like battery, powercable, headphone, manual and some swag. The cover removes easily for placing the battery and I decided to place my SIM-card and SD-card too. All pretty well accessible.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCeeYz9EIi8/Ucl0ZCwEUcI/AAAAAAAAALc/embjeE5JNKg/s1600/20130624_190238.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCeeYz9EIi8/Ucl0ZCwEUcI/AAAAAAAAALc/embjeE5JNKg/s640/20130624_190238.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />So let's bring some live into this phone, power it up and hé, it starts immediately when pushing the power button. Apparently the battery was pre-loaded. Seeing the Geeksphone-logo come by and the Firefox-logo makes me feel proud being part of Mozilla for accomplishing this, great work!<br />After following the First Time Usage manual I am ready to start.

Being used to a Galaxy S2, I miss the menu and back-button, they don't exist. There is only a Home-button outside the screen in the middle below, menu- and back-buttons are presented on the screen itself depending on the application you started. First impression is that responsiveness of the touchscreen is a little lame, but again I am used to a S2 which costs around €500, the Keon is for sale for €89. After a little swiping around I am quite impressed with the speed though.<br />Only 4 buttons on the home-screen, 1 screen to the left and 2 to the right. All buttons are made in a circle.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZKzjLpHWXMU/Ucl0aF70PcI/AAAAAAAAALw/oXt_7frbs58/s1600/20130624_203830.jpg\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZKzjLpHWXMU/Ucl0aF70PcI/AAAAAAAAALw/oXt_7frbs58/s320/20130624_203830.jpg\" width=\"240\" /></a></div>Jumping right to the Settings to hook this thing up to the Internet.

This work is technically part of the effort to make subframes asynchronously scrollable in OMTC, but it has helped us to fix other bugs as well. This post a braindump of the coordinate systems I've uncovered and the mental model I have.
<br />
<br />As of this writing, I have defined four \"pixel\" types in <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/Units.h\">layout/base/Units.h</a>. These are CSSPixel, LayoutDevicePixel, LayerPixel, and ScreenPixel. CSSPixel is the simplest - it represents a CSS pixel, which is what web content authors use to specify dimensions of things. Almost every Web API [1] deals with CSS pixels.
<br />
<br />In the days of yore, 1 CSS pixel corresponded exactly to one screen pixel. That is, when you created a div that was 50 CSS pixels wide, it would show up as 50 pixels wide on your screen. If you have a desktop monitor that is 1024 pixels wide [2] and you create a div that is 1024 CSS pixels wide, it takes up your entire monitor width. Makes sense, right?
<br />
<br />Now, let us enter the world of HiDPI display devices. On HiDPI devices, the screen pixels are so small and packed together so tightly that mapping 1 CSS pixel to 1 screen pixel doesn't make sense any more. Sure, you can fit more on the screen, but it's too tiny to be readable or useful. So we have this concept of a widget scale. The <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/xpwidgets/nsBaseWidget.cpp#l421\">nsIWidget::GetDefaultScale()</a> returns a scaling factor to account for HiDPI displays. For example, see the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/widget/gonk/nsWindow.cpp#l557\">gonk implementation</a> which makes B2G perform a scale amount based on the actual DPI of the device. This introduces a new coordinate system that layout refers to as \"device pixels\" and what I've called LayoutDevicePixels.
<br />
<br />In the layout code, the widget scale affects two main things. One is the size of the CSS viewport [3]. If we have a widget scale of 2.0, then each CSS pixel is 2 screen pixels wide, which means that on a 1024x768 screen with a maximized browser window, you can only fit 512 CSS pixels across. So the CSS viewport width is adjusted to account for this. The other is the scale factor from app units [4] to screen pixels. Instead of the usual 60 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel you would normally get, setting a 2.0 widget scale results in 30 app units being converted to 1 screen pixel. This effectively makes each CSS pixel twice as wide when being rendered to the screen, which is the point of the whole exercise.
<br />
<br />But that's not all! There is another factor that comes into play between CSS pixels and LayoutDevicePixels, and that is the \"<a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsPresContext.cpp#l1399\">full zoom</a>\". This is when, on desktop Firefox, you perform the \"Zoom In\" or \"Zoom Out\" actions. Doing a \"Zoom In\" action increases the full zoom, which works almost identically to increasing the widget scale. That is, setting a zoom of 110% is pretty much equivalent to having a widget scale of 1.1. The only difference I'm aware of is that if you specify your CSS dimensions in real-world units such as inches, then they are affected by the widget scale but not by the \"full zoom\". Tricksy!
<br />
<br />So to summarize what we have so far: in a world with just CSSPixels and LayoutDevicePixels, dimensions are specified in CSSPixels by content authors, and the browser maps them to LayoutDevicePixels based on the widget scale and full zoom. These LayoutDevicePixels are then displayed 1:1 on screen pixels as defined by the underlying platform.
<br />
<br />But what about mobile? Welcome to the land of OMTC and pinch-zoom. OMTC stands for off-main-thread compositor, and is what allows you to pinch a page on Fennec and have it instantly zoom. What's happening here is the painted page is transformed in OpenGL [5], without Gecko really knowing about what's going on. Since Gecko isn't repainting anything, this is super fast, and allows us to animate pinch-zoom at 60 frames per second (or close to it).
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, it also introduces a new coordinate system, because the LayoutDevicePixels that Gecko produced are no longer displayed 1:1 on the screen. Gecko could have painted something 10 LayoutDevicePixels wide (and so the texture uploaded to the graphics hardware would be 10 pixels wide) but then the user does a pinch-zoom and BAM! now it's taking up 20 pixels on the screen, because we told OpenGL to scale it up by 2x. So here we have our third pixel type defined: the ScreenPixel. In the preceding example the pinch-zoom produced a scale factor of 2.0 and so 10 LayoutDevicePixels would get mapped to 20 ScreenPixels.
<br />
<br />Now say you're viewing a page in Fennec and zoom in using pinch-zoom. And then you zoom in some more. And then some more. If all we did was take the LayoutDevicePixels and tell OpenGL to render them bigger by scaling it in hardware, you would end up with a very pixellated and blurry view of the page. In order to make it look good again, we have to go back to Gecko and tell it to repaint the visible area of the page at a higher density, allowing us to remove the OpenGL scaling. For example, instead of rendering a paragraph of text into a texture and scaling that up in OpenGL to display a single word really big, we can tell Gecko to just render that one word really big, and to use up the entire texture to do it. This is done by a call to <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsIPresShell.h#l1217\">nsIPresShell::SetResolution()</a>.
<br />
<br />Setting the resolution doesn't change our definition of CSSPixels or LayoutDevicePixels, but it does change something. To describe this change, we need to introduce a new coordinate system. This is the LayerPixel [6], and it sits between LayoutDevicePixel and ScreenPixel. That is, the resolution changes how many LayerPixels are produced for each LayoutDevicePixel, and now pinch-zooming affects the scale between LayerPixels and ScreenPixels. This is a little cyclical because as you perform a pinch-zoom, LayerPixels and ScreenPixels get farther apart in size. Then, once you finish the zoom, we tell Gecko to re-render the content at a new resolution such that LayerPixels and ScreenPixels are the same size once again, and we render the new LayerPixels at a 1:1 scale on the screen. When this happens the visible content goes from being blurry back to being sharp, which you can see in Fennec if you pay close attention when zooming in.
<br />
<br />So to summarize, here is what we have now:
<br />CSSPixel x widget scale x full zoom = LayoutDevicePixel
<br />LayoutDevicePixel x resolution = LayerPixel
<br />LayerPixel x OMTC transforms = ScreenPixel
<br />
<br />And so ends my braindump. Hopefully what I've written above will not change going forward, and the terms I've used can become part of the Gecko developer vocabulary, so that when dealing with code in different coordinate systems it's much easier to agree on what we mean.
<br />
<br />Notes:
<br />[1] The only exception I can think of is window.outerWidth, which is in screen pixels.
<br />[2] Note that the number of screen pixels displayed on a physical device may be modified by the operating system. For example, you can change your screen resolution from 1024x768 to 800x600, which changes the size and number of screen pixels. That's fine - we don't need to account for that in our code as the OS takes care of it.
<br />[3] The CSS viewport affects how wide the page is laid out by the layout code. One way of visualizing this is that if you have a page with just plain text, the text will be wrapped so that it doesn't exceed the CSS viewport width.
<br />[4] App units are what layout does all of its calculations in. One app unit is exactly one-sixtieth of a CSS pixel. The \"60\" was chosen because it has many integer factors and so allows representing common fractions losslessly.
<br />[5] The actual graphics system in use depends on the platform. OpenGL is just an example.
<br />[6] When Gecko paints the various elements on a page, it flattens them into \"layers\" that it hands off to the graphics stack. This is where the term LayerPixel comes from.</p>" nil nil "dc30152d9437a2e739cfa72289dbe7c7") (122 (20937 40173 543755) "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/rawkes/~3/ElExNBV2GaY/vizicities-supported-by-simudyne" "Rob Hawkes: Announcing Simudyne as the first supporter of ViziCities" nil "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000" "<p>Wow, it's been an amazing few days!

So here we have our third pixel type defined: the ScreenPixel. In the preceding example the pinch-zoom produced a scale factor of 2.0 and so 10 LayoutDevicePixels would get mapped to 20 ScreenPixels.
<br />
<br />Now say you're viewing a page in Fennec and zoom in using pinch-zoom. And then you zoom in some more. And then some more. If all we did was take the LayoutDevicePixels and tell OpenGL to render them bigger by scaling it in hardware, you would end up with a very pixellated and blurry view of the page. In order to make it look good again, we have to go back to Gecko and tell it to repaint the visible area of the page at a higher density, allowing us to remove the OpenGL scaling. For example, instead of rendering a paragraph of text into a texture and scaling that up in OpenGL to display a single word really big, we can tell Gecko to just render that one word really big, and to use up the entire texture to do it. This is done by a call to <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7e05a42582e4/layout/base/nsIPresShell.h#l1217\">nsIPresShell::SetResolution()</a>.
<br />
<br />Setting the resolution doesn't change our definition of CSSPixels or LayoutDevicePixels, but it does change something. To describe this change, we need to introduce a new coordinate system. This is the LayerPixel [6], and it sits between LayoutDevicePixel and ScreenPixel. That is, the resolution changes how many LayerPixels are produced for each LayoutDevicePixel, and now pinch-zooming affects the scale between LayerPixels and ScreenPixels. This is a little cyclical because as you perform a pinch-zoom, LayerPixels and ScreenPixels get farther apart in size. Then, once you finish the zoom, we tell Gecko to re-render the content at a new resolution such that LayerPixels and ScreenPixels are the same size once again, and we render the new LayerPixels at a 1:1 scale on the screen. When this happens the visible content goes from being blurry back to being sharp, which you can see in Fennec if you pay close attention when zooming in.
<br />
<br />So to summarize, here is what we have now:
<br />CSSPixel x widget scale x full zoom = LayoutDevicePixel
<br />LayoutDevicePixel x resolution = LayerPixel
<br />LayerPixel x OMTC transforms = ScreenPixel
<br />
<br />And so ends my braindump. Hopefully what I've written above will not change going forward, and the terms I've used can become part of the Gecko developer vocabulary, so that when dealing with code in different coordinate systems it's much easier to agree on what we mean.
<br />
<br />Notes:
<br />[1] The only exception I can think of is window.outerWidth, which is in screen pixels.
<br />[2] Note that the number of screen pixels displayed on a physical device may be modified by the operating system. For example, you can change your screen resolution from 1024x768 to 800x600, which changes the size and number of screen pixels. That's fine - we don't need to account for that in our code as the OS takes care of it.
<br />[3] The CSS viewport affects how wide the page is laid out by the layout code. One way of visualizing this is that if you have a page with just plain text, the text will be wrapped so that it doesn't exceed the CSS viewport width.
<br />[4] App units are what layout does all of its calculations in. One app unit is exactly one-sixtieth of a CSS pixel. The \"60\" was chosen because it has many integer factors and so allows representing common fractions losslessly.
<br />[5] The actual graphics system in use depends on the platform. OpenGL is just an example.
<br />[6] When Gecko paints the various elements on a page, it flattens them into \"layers\" that it hands off to the graphics page. This is where the term LayerPixel comes from.</p>" nil nil "ed175cbf7471aa266fcd3ec13277add8") (119 (20937 23579 236008) "http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2013/06/24/the-importance-of-time-on-automated-machine-configuration" "Gregory Szorc: The Importance of Time on Automated Machine Configuration" nil "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 21:00:00 +0000" "<p>Usage of machine configuration management software like Puppet
and Chef has taken off in recent years. And rightly so - these
pieces of software make the lives of countless system
administrators much better (in theory).</p>
<p>In their default (and common) configuration, these pieces of
software do a terrific job of ensuring a machine is provisioned with
<em>today's</em> configuration. However, for many server provisioning
scenarios, we actually care about <em>yesterday's</em> configuration.</p>
<p>In this post, I will talk about the importance of time when configuring
machines.</p>
<h3>Describing the problem</h3>
<p>If you've worked on any kind of server application, chances are
you've had to deal with a rollback. Some new version of a package
or web application is rolled out to production. However, due to
unforeseen problems, it needed to be rolled back.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps you operate a farm of machines that continuously build
or compile software from version control. It's desirable to be able
to reproduce the output from a previous build (ideally bit
identical).</p>
<p>In these scenarios, the wall time plays a crucial rule when dealing
with a central, master configuration server (such as a Puppet
master).</p>
<p>Since a client will always pull the latest revision of its
configuration from the server, it's very easy to define your
configurations such that the result of machine provisioning
today is different from yesterday (or last week or last month).</p>
<p>For example, let's say you are running Puppet to manage a machine
that sits in a continuous integration farm and recompiles a source
tree over and over. In your Puppet manifest you have:</p>
<pre><code>package {
\"gcc\":
ensure => latest
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you run Puppet today, you may pull down GCC 4.7 from the remote
package repository because 4.7 is the latest version available. But
if you run Puppet tomorrow, you may pull down GCC 4.8 because the
package repository has been updated! If for some reason you need
to rebuild one of today's builds tomorrow (perhaps you want to
rebuild that revision plus a minor patch), they'll use different
compiler versions (or any package for that matter) and the output
may not be consistent - it may not even work at all! So much for
repeatability.</p>
<p>File templates are another example. In Puppet, file templates are
evaluated on the server and the results are sent to the client. So,
the output of file template execution today might be different from
the output tomorrow. If you needed to roll back your server to an
old version, you may not be able to do that because the template
on the server isn't backwards compatible! This can be worked around,
sure (commonly by copying the template and branching differences),
but over time these hacks accumulate in a giant pile of complexity.</p>
<p>The common issue here is that time has an impact on the outcome of
machine configuration. I refer to this issue as <strong>time-dependent
idempotency</strong>. In other words, does time play a role in the
supposedly idempotent configuration process? If the output is
consistent no matter <em>when</em> you run the configuration, it is
time-independent and truly idempotent. If it varies depending on
when configuration is performed, it is time-dependent and thus
not truly idempotent.</p>
<h3>Solving the problem</h3>
<p>My attitude towards machine configuration and automation is that
it should be as time independent as possible. If I need to revert
to yesterday's state or want to reproduce something that happened
months ago, I want strong guarantees that it will be similar, if not
identical. Now, this is just my opinion. I've worked in environments
where we had these strong guarantees. And having had this luxury,
I abhore the alternative where so many pieces of configuration vary
over time as the central configuration moves forward without the
ability to turn back the clock. As always, your needs may be
different and this post may not apply to you!</p>
<p>I said <em>as possible</em> a few times in the previous paragraph.
While you could likely make all parts of your configuration time
independent, it's not a good idea. In the real world, things
change over time and making all configuration data static regardless
of time will produce a broken or bad configuration.</p>
<p>User access is one such piece of configuration. Employees come and
go. Passwords and SSH keys change. You don't want to revert user
access to the way it was two months ago, restoring access to a
disgruntled former employee or allowing access via a compromised
password. Network configuration is another. Say the network topology
changed and the firewall rules need updating. If you reverted the
networking configuration, the machine likely wouldn't work on the
network!</p>
<p>This highlights an important fact: <strong>if making your machine
configuration time independent is a goal, you will need to
bifurcate configuration by time dependency and solve for both.</strong>
You'll need to identify every piece of configuration and
ask <em>do I put this in the bucket that is constant over time or
the bucket that changes over time?</em></p>
<p>Machine configuration software can do a terrific job of ensuring
an applied configuration is idempotent. The problem is it typically
can't manage both time-dependent and time-independent attributes
at the same time. Solving this requires a little brain power, but
is achievable if there is will. In the next section, I'll describe
how.</p>
<h4>Technical implementation</h4>
<p>Time-dependent machine configuration is a solved problem. Deploy
Puppet master (or similar) and you are good to go.</p>
<p>Time-independent configuration is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the first step is to isolate all of the
configuration you want to be time independent. Next, you need to
ensure time dependency doesn't creep into that configuration. You
need to identify things that can change over time and take
measures to ensure those changes won't affect the configuration.
I encourage you to employ the <em>external system
test</em>: <em>does this aspect of configuration depend on an external
system or entity? If so how will I prevent changes in it over
time from affecting us?</em></p>
<p>Package repositories are one such external system. New package
versions are released all the time. Old packages are deleted.
If your configuration says to install the <em>latest</em> package, there's
no guarantee the package version won't change unless the package
repository doesn't change. If you simply pin a package to a specific
version, that version may disappear from the server. The solution:
pin packages to specific versions <strong>and</strong> run your own package
mirror that doesn't delete or modify existing packages.</p>
<p>Does your configuration fetch a file from a remote server or use
a file as a template? Cache that file locally (in case it
disappears) and put it under version control. Have the configuration
reference the version control revision of that file. As long as the
repository is accessible, the exact version of the file can be
retrieved at any time without variation.</p>
<p>In my professional career, I've used two separate systems for
managing time-independent configuration data. Both relied heavily
on version control. Essentially, all the time-independent
configuration data is collected into a single repository - an
independent repository from all the time-dependent data
(although that's technically an implementation detail). For Puppet,
this would include all the manifests, modules, and files used
directly by Puppet. When you want to <em>activate</em> a machine with
a configuration, you simply say <em>check out revision X of this
repository and apply its configuration.</em> Since <em>revision X</em> of
the repository is constant over time, the set of configuration
data being used to configure the machine is constant. And, if
you've done things correctly, the output is idempotent over time.</p>
<p>In one of these systems, we actually had two versions of Puppet
running on a machine. First, we had the daemon communicating with a
central Puppet master. It was continually applying time-dependent
configuration (user accounts, passwords, networking, etc). We
supplemented this was a manually executed standalone Puppet
instance. When you ran a script, it asked the Puppet master for its
configuration. Part of that configuration was the revision of the
time-independent Git repository containing the Puppet configuration
files the client should use. It then pulled the Git repo, checked
out the specified revision, merged Puppet master's settings for the
node with that config (not the manifests, just some variables),
then ran Puppet locally to apply the configuration. While a
machine's configuration typically referenced a SHA-1 of a specific
Git commit to use, we could use anything <em>git checkout</em> understood.
We had some machines running <em>master</em> or other branches if we didn't
care about time-independent idempotency for that machine at that
time. What this all meant was that if you wanted to roll back
a machine's configuration, you simply specified an earlier Git
commit SHA-1 and then re-ran local Puppet.</p>
<p>We were largely satisfied with this model. We felt like we got
the best of both worlds. And, since we were using the same
technology (Puppet) for time-dependent and time-independent
configuration, it was a pretty simple-to-understand system.
A downside was there were two Puppet instances instead of one.
With a little effort, someone could probably devise a way for
the Puppet master to <em>merge</em> the two configuration trees. I'll
leave that as an exercise for the reader. Perhaps someone has
done this already! If you know of someone, please leave a comment!</p>
<h4>Challenges</h4>
<p>The solution I describe does not come without its challenges.</p>
<p>First, deciding whether a piece of configuration is time dependent
or time independent can be quiet complicated. For example,
should a package update for a critical security fix be time
dependent or time independent? It depends! What's the risk of
the machine not receiving that update? How often is that machine
rolled back? Is that package important to the operation/role
of that machine (if so, I'd lean more towards time independent).</p>
<p>Second, minimizing exposure to external entities is hard. While
I recommend putting as much as possible under version control in a
single repository and pinning versions everywhere when you interface
with an external system, this isn't always feasible. It's probably
a silly idea to have your 200 GB Apt repository under version
control and distributed locally to every machine in your network.
So, you end up introducing specialized one-off systems as necessary.
For our package repository, we just ran an internal HTTP server that
only allowed inserts (no deletes or mutates). If we were creative, we
could have likely devised a way for the client to pass a <em>revision</em> with
the request and have the server dynamically serve from that revision
of an underlying repository. Although, that may not work for every
server type due to limited control over client behavior.</p>
<p>Third, ensuring compatibility between the time-dependent configuration
and time-independent configuration is hard. This is a consequence of
separating those configurations. Will a time-independent configuration
from a revision two years ago work with the time-dependent
configuration of today? This issue can be mitigated by first
having as much configuration as possible be time independent and
second not relying on wide support windows. If it's good enough
to only support compatibility for time-independent configurations
less than a month old, then it's good enough! With this issue, I feel
you are trading long-term future incompatibility for well-defined
and understood behavior in the short to medium term. That's
a trade-off I'm willing to make.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Many machine configuration management systems only care about
idempotency <em>today</em>. However, with a little effort, it's possible
to achieve consistent state over time. This requires a little extra
effort and brain power, but it's certainly doable.</p>
<p>The next time you are programming your system configuration tool, I
hope you take the time to consider the effects time will have and that
you will take the necessary steps to ensure consistency over time
(assuming you want that, of course).</p>" nil nil "20b47774f4a8393a562f76e8e1028315") (118 (20937 23579 233950) "http://www.laurathomson.com/2013/06/ode-to-morgamic/" "Laura Thomson: Ode to Morgamic" "laura" "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 18:47:07 +0000" "<p>Mike Morgan - <a href=\"http://morgamic.com/\">morgamic</a> - was my boss for nearly six years. Friday was his last day working at Mozilla. I wanted to  write something to memorialize his departure, in the same way <a href=\"http://morgamic.com/2013/05/06/ode-to-james-socol/\">he did for  others</a>. Of course, this blog post will not be as eloquent as if he had  written it, but I will do my best.</p>
<p>There are two things that stand out about Morgamic: his leadership, and his passion for the Mozilla and the Open Web.</p>
<p>Morgamic  is that rare leader who, rather than rallying the troops from the  front, leads from beside you, encouraging you every step of the way. Morgamic is an introvert. Never let anyone tell you introverts can’t  lead. He excels at leadership because of his special talents for  introspection, reflection and the ability and willingness to listen.</p>
<p>He taught me, by example, and by teaching me to ask the right questions, three important things about leadership:</p>
<p>Enable autonomy by quiet leadership. In six years, I don’t think he  ever really told me to do anything. Like Confucius, he simply asked  questions that helped me figure it out for myself.</p>
<p>Trust people. I  can get really mad about things being done in a way I consider wrong.  He always encouraged me to ask myself why someone might be doing it that  way, and to trust that they were doing the best they could.</p>
<p>Reframe problems. Mike sees problems as complex and nuanced. It’s  never black or white: you just have to zoom out a little to see a  million solutions to a problem that you might not have seen before.</p>
<p>We  certainly had disagreements over the last few years, but  we always managed to resolve them in a constructive way, and that might  be the greatest lesson of all. As a technical leader, he goes out of his  way to hire people that he is confident are smarter than him, and he  never gets insecure about it. (In my case, I’m not sure he was right. He  certainly outdoes me in wisdom.) He coaches those people into  excellence. Morgamic is a force multiplier. Not only that, but he cares  about his people, and will go out of his way to help them develop into  the best and happiest versions of themselves.</p>
<p>Virtually every website you use at Mozilla was made with Morgamic’s  hands, Morgamic’s help, or Morgamic’s leadership. We still use code from  the first web app he ever built for Mozilla, when he was a volunteer:  Every time you update or download Firefox, you can do that because of  Morgamic.</p>
<p>Morgamic also has a vision and a passion for the Mozilla Mission and  the Open Web. If you’ve ever talked with him about it, you’ll know  exactly what I mean. With Mike, it always came back to two questions:  How does this move the mission forward? How does this benefit the Open  Web?</p>
<p>He also manages to bring humor and humanity into every action:  whether it’s org charts with Care Bears, photoshopping your head onto a  meerkat, or presenting interns with trophies at the end of the summer.  Once, when I had a sick pet and he knew I was really upset, he sent me a  giant bunch of flowers (’From the webdev team’). That made me cry,  quite a lot, but in a good way, I swear. I still have that card on my  desk, and I tear up every time I look at it.</p>
<p>I’m not the only one with stories. Here are some from other people  who have had the pleasure and privilege of working with Morgamic:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m not sure I consistently hear more praise for any other manager  at Mozilla as I do about Morgamic. That includes me hearing myself talk about  how pleased I’ve been over the past two years to have him mentor me —  and our entire team. I feel pushed to do great work because of him, but  in a way unique to him and Fred (who I have to think he mentored  well, given their similar management styles) — constantly encouraged and  pushed but with amazing empathy and reason for pushing me. He also encouraged us all to get along with each other and all of Mozilla,  taken what seems to me as the sanest growth plan in Mozilla, and  strived to build an awesome team instead of just a big one. He  encouraged us to reach out and include “former” colleagues and constantly  bring potentials into the webdev world.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Mike Morgan brought me to Mozilla, a move I had always wanted and was appreciative of. It wasn’t until I had to opportunity to really work with Mike and see him in action that I realized how much of a compliment it was to have him seek me. Mike invests so much into each of his developers that they can’t help but strive for greatness to repay the favor. Morgamic fought hard for his developers and made sure they were working on something they were passionate about. I’m proud to have worked with and for Mike Morgan and I’m already jealous of the next set of developers he’ll lead. Mozilla wont be the same without him. Legend.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Like many of us on the web development team, I came to Mozilla through  Mike. I’ve worked closely with him for 7 years and watched him grow  from a volunteer developer into a well respected leader. I watched a  team of two turn into a team of fifty with his expertise and guidance.  He is magnetic - someone who naturally acts as a hub, of people, of  information, and of value. He strived to be a better leader, reading  books, studying role models, and speaking with experts about how to  encourage excellence on his team. People who have worked with him will  understand how short “he’ll be missed” falls - we’re all fortunate to  have worked with him for this long, and really, I guess we’ve been  greedy, it’s only fair to let the rest of the world have a chance too. “</em></li>
<li><em>“Even when we disagreed he trusted me. He could have ordered me to do  something else, or ordered my boss to order me. Instead he’d take me for  coffee and try to convince me of another way. Usually he succeeded, but  when he didn’t he would go out of his way to support my decision. Our  products were a byproduct of his relentless focus on the team — hiring  the right people and trusting them to make the right decisions.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Morgamic embodied Mozilla in so many ways. He was a continual positive influence in everything we did in WebDev, always believing in people and trying to get them to improve themselves. But he went far beyond the boundaries of the team and influenced so many others. His legacy at Mozilla will continue on from those lucky enough to have worked with him.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Soon after I switched from the Webdev team to the Engagement team,  Morgamic walked by the glass walls of a meeting room I was doing a video  conference in. He walked away, came back with a whiteboard marker, drew  a heart, and left.</em><em><br />
I’d follow that man to Hades.” </em></li>
<li><em>“He helped me feel good at Mozilla very quickly. I like how he can be totally not serious sometimes, but efficient when he needs to. He gathered an impressive team of wonderful, excellent, incredible Web  devs (except me, of course, but every team has its weakness <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.laurathomson.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> ). </em><em>We were the first interns to win the Annual Employees VS Interns Basketball match!”</em></li>
<li><em>“Morgamic exemplified Mozilla for me. Openness, transparency, and just plain fight-for-the-user awesomeness. Morgamic was one of the few managers I’ve had who was less my superior and more my facilitator. He often acted like a Mozilla concierge - ensuring I had what I needed, intervening where I was blocked, and making sure I was happy and headed in the right direction. I don’t think I ever disagreed with his strategic decisions, which often had included my input or had at least been communicated to me early & often. Not that my agreement is needed to run the company, but it at least felt like he always had my back and we were doing things the right way.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’ve known and worked with Mike for ten years. On meeting him, I knew immediately that I had met one of those rare personalities that one encounters only only a few times in life. I watched Mike mature over the years in both his personal and professional life. One Mozilla cantina night, I recall sitting with Shaver and, possibly, Schrep: the conversation was about finding good engineering management. I remember pointing across the room to Mike, who likely at that moment was doing something very silly/dangerous will alcohol and fire. ‘There is your man, promote from within and you’ll see amazing things from him.’ I think I nailed it.”<br />
</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The words “he will be missed” are so far from adequate it’s not even funny.</p>
<p>His legacy at Mozilla will live on, in the projects he built, in the  people he mentored, through every Open Source project that comes out  of Webdev, in the Mozilla mission, and in the hearts of all of us. I  can’t wait to see what he pulls off next - I’ll be watching, and so  should you, because I have no doubt it will be amazing. Remember, too,  that being a Mozillian isn’t something that stops just because you  change jobs. It’s more like what happens when your best friend moves  away. Nothing changes except the logistics.</p>
<p>As for the rest of us, we will miss him, but we will go on working for the Open Web as the better people he helped us to be.</p>
<p>On  his last day working at Mozilla, Morgamic said, “Webdev isn’t a job,  it’s a movement.” I’ll leave you with that, and with this video, that I  know he liked to watch over and over:<br />

<h3>Diversity beyond gender</h3>
<p>My first session of the day was about creating welcoming spaces that encourage all kinds of diversity, rather than only focusing on gender. Those present were very interested in physical space issues involving hacker/maker spaces or running events. We discussed a set of practices that have worked in several spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the people involved set the agenda and define the uses of a space.</li>
<li>Create an environment where a person of color is not the only person of color when they walk in.</li>
<li>Describe a space as a “makerspace” rather than a “hackerspace”.</li>
<li>Make events invite-only to establish a welcoming culture.</li>
<li>Don’t say “please come if you are a woman”. This is tokenizing language that discourages participation. </li>
<li>Invite everyone to organize events, not just attend events.</li>
<li>Invite people to events through existing, established groups.</li>
<li>Spend time thinking about who and what is missing from a group or space and take action to fix or change. </li>
</ul>
<p>Patterns of exclusion start long before we deal with them in technology culture.</p>
<h3>Being feminine in tech</h3>
<p>This was a very large group, so we attempted to focus discussion on some key issues. I was also reminded of “<a href=\"http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Grunch\">grunch</a>“, the feeling you get when you’ve suddenly been reminded that you’ve got a feminine body.</p>
<p>Our initial set of discussion topics were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Masculinity valued over femininity — how do we get to express a masculine identity in an authentic way and not devalue femininity? Are we expressing masculinity because it’s who we are or because we perceive it as having more value?</li>
<li>How “woman” can I be? do I have to switch to their language? what rules do I have follow?</li>
<li>How do I make suggestions for a more gender neutral culture in the workplace?</li>
<li>Peer shaming if you represent as highly feminine or androgynous</li>
<li>Reacting to the hyper masculine by occupying a more feminine place despite its authenticity</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants shared a series of stories about their experiences expressing feminine or masculine dress, haircut, physical attributes. Most of the descriptions were posed as experiments — “I spent a month wearing dresses to normalize femininity in my workplace and here’s what happened.” The experiments women are running on themselves and their coworkers to try to get people used to women in the workplace are fascinating and shocking. Reflecting on the discussion, I felt like we were back in pre-women’s suffrage, where men were shocked at women working or wanting equal rights.</p>
<p>I also realized that I think about issues with what I wear a lot, but rarely talk about it with my colleagues.</p>
<p>I learned about differentiating between a few different concepts when talking about expressing femininity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gender policing: comments designed to inform someone that they’re violating an accepted norm. Examples include being described as “dressing too slutty”, aggressive attention when a woman has a shaved head and looks masculine or androgynous. </li>
<li>Masculine assimilation: dressing more masculine to avoid unwanted attention</li>
<li>Feminine presentation seen as inviting sexual attention: several people described a dramatic change in behavior among colleagues or students when women wore traditionally feminine clothing (skirts, dresses, blouses)</li>
<li>Peer shaming: in this context, we discussed concerns with women who shame other women over appearing/acting too feminine, or using feminine symbols like the color pink.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was a lot more to this conversation. Looking back over the notes, I am a bit overwhelmed at how much ground we covered among so many people in just an hour. This session also led to some other hallway track conversations where I learned a bit more about how individuals are trying to balance their activism with their personal relationships with other women in open source/hardware/culture communities.</p>
<h3>Hardware hacking!</h3>
<p>I spent some time with the hardware hackers. Several women brought soft circuits, and one person brought a soldering station so that people could try out soldering for the first time. I was trying to get some IR LEDs integrated into a headband, and we had some issues with the shape and the stretchiness of our material. Other folks at the table were making blinking fuzzy muppet/monsters for their badges. Lots of very adorable blinky things were assembled.</p>
<p>I did demonstrate how to troubleshoot LEDs and what IR light looks like on digital cameras. I talked a bit more about medical devices with someone looking into how to hack her own augmentations. It felt a little like a “from the future” conversation. <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<h3>Mozilla contributor dinner</h3>
<p>I spent Sunday evening having dinner with some Mozilla contributors from France and a couple coworkers. I was probably the only person at the table who spoke only English, reminding me that I really aught to keep up on my language lessons. <img alt=\":D\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" /> </p>
<p>I caught my buddy Diane up on what had happened at AdaCamp, met Delphine’s husband and tried to convince some contributors to lead an effort to have an AdaCamp in Europe!</p>
<p>By the end of the evening, I was ready to collapse and get back to Portland!</p>
<h3>Summing up</h3>
<p>My last post about AdaCamp will be reflecting on all three of the camps – starting in Melbourne, Australia, then Washington, DC and finally in San Francisco. The event has grown from about 40 people to 200+, and for me, is the most exciting gathering of women in open source, open hardware and open culture. I’ve never been around so many women who share the same values, who are fighting for openness in technology and who are focused on tearing down the many barriers we face to involving more women in our technical communities.</p>" nil nil "d1b54e8aa1544cb3fc8b5e4142b9f1c2") (116 (20937 23579 225377) "http://dutherenverseauborddelatable.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/alors-comme-ca-votre-projet-a-besoin-de-contributeurs/" "David Rajchenbach Teller: Alors comme =?utf-8?Q?=C3=A7a=2C?= votre projet a besoin de contributeurs ?"

<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">C’est une histoire assez triste. Elle vous est peut-être familière, soit dans la peau du contributeur existant, soit dans la peau de l’anonyme qui voulait contribuer. Cette histoire est malheureusement fréquente dans les projets qui cherchent à s’étendre. Voyons ce que nous pourrions faire pour changer la fin du conte.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Il était une fois un projet de logiciel libre (ou, d’ailleurs, un projet associatif). Un jour, un anonyme se présenta et annonça qu’il souhaitait aider. C’était une bonne nouvelle, car le projet avait bien besoin de contributeurs supplémentaires.

<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Malgré tous les efforts des contributeurs existants, l’histoire est toujours aussi triste. Alors que faire pour arriver à une fin heureuse ?</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Il était une fois un projet de logiciel libre (ou, d’ailleurs, un projet associatif).

Certaines de ces tâches étaient accessibles à des nouveaux venus.

<h3>Le système des bugs mentorés</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chez Mozilla, nous utilisons depuis quelques années le système que je viens de décrire, avec un succès impressionnant. Tous les quelques jours, sur les projets que je suis, de nouveaux contributeurs se présentent, suivent les tutoriels, choisissent une tâche, se mettent immédiatement au travail – et finissent la plupart du temps par publier leurs contributions, et un peu plus tard par devenir eux-mêmes mentors sur d’autres tâches.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Marquer une tâche comme mentorée prend environ deux secondes.</p>
<ol>
<li>je viens d’ouvrir un bug sur Bugzilla et je réalise qu’un débutant pourrait certainement le traiter avec un peu d’aide ;</li>
<li>j’ajoute dans le champ libre (« whiteboard ») du bug l’information [mentor=Yoric] – à partir de ce moment-là, les nouveaux venus peuvent trouver ce bug dans notre moteur de recherche de bugs mentorés ;</li>
<li>j’en profite pour ajouter dans ce même champ libre l’information [lang=js][lang=c++] – à partir de ce moment-là, les nouveaux venus cherchant des bugs dans l’une des deux technologies “JavaScript” ou “C++” verront s’afficher ce bug ;</li>
<li>c’est fini – un de ces jours, un contributeur me contactera peut-être pour demander s’il peut travailler sur ce bug.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bien entendu, l’exemple utilise Bugzilla et des contributions techniques mais il est assez simple d’étendre le système à d’autres gestionnaires de tâches et à des tâches purement non techniques.</p>
<p>Pour un nouveau venu, commencer est aussi très simple :</p>
<ol>
<li>lire <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/introduction\">notre document d’introduction</a> et suivre le lien vers <a href=\"http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/?unowned=1\">le moteur de recherche de bugs mentorés</a> ;</li>
<li>choisir des centres d’intérêt et un bug ;</li>
<li>contacter le mentor par mail ou par irc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Certaines étapes peuvent encore être fluidifiées (le nom et l’adresse du mentor ne sont pas toujours évidents à trouver à l’écran, etc.) mais c’est en cours. Nous espérons que le système pourra, à terme, être généralisé à tous les projets de Mozilla, techniques ou non.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Du coup, si vous participez à un projet (Mozilla ou autre) qui n’emploie pas un tel système de bugs mentorés et qui cherche des contributeurs, je vous invite vivement à essayer.</p>

ads because of third party cookies, and in general about the lack
of privacy on the internets</p>
<p>I made the decision to not depend on a couple of big companies
anymore for all my data in the cloud and to pay for the services
I really needed & use the proper Firefox addons to cut down
on the ads.</p>
<p>I slowly moved away from Google.</p>
<p>I moved to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.newsblur.com/\">NewsBlur</a>
instead of Google Reader - before Reader was planned to be stopped.</p>
<p>I moved from Gmail to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://fastmail.fm\">fastmail.fm</a>. That was the
hardest one because I was on Gmail since 2004.</p>
<p>Last, I moved from the Google search engine to DuckDuckGo, then
to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://startpage.com/\">StartPage</a>. The latter gives better
results than DuckDuckGo in general because it's a proxy on the
top of Google search engine. It just secures your privacy and
unlike DDG, you won't get <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/privacy\">Amazon referral links in your results</a>  I'd rather pay a yearly
rate at DDG rather than this referral system.</p>
<p>Anyways, I kept my Google account for two reasons: redirecting mails
to my fastmail account and using Google+ because I like this service
a lot. The redirection is not important anymore. After over a year of
redirection - people should know how to reach me :)</p>
<p>I also had Facebook to stay connected with my non-geek friends
mostly. I also use Twitter a lot.</p>
<p>However, the recent privacy scandals made me think a bit about
how I use all these services.</p>
<p>First of all, G+ and Facebook provide features to share <strong>privately</strong>
some data to a specific set of people. We've seen that our privacy
is not guaranteed. They'll give your data away if they're asked.</p>
<p>And well, they are commercial companies that need to sell ads,
so your private content is used anyways. Just look at the ads that
are displayed besides your e-mail when you use GMail.</p>
<p>So while there's an incentive to let you share data thinking
it's not public, shit happens. So I don't see the point of pushing
anything non-public in those silos. And it turns out that I am mostly
a consumer so I am fine using apps like G+ with no account -- and if possible
via <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor</a>.</p>
<p>If I have cool stuff to talk about, I can blog and probably
do a better job in one blog post than in numerous G+ or FB posts.</p>
<p>Twitter on the other hand, is mostly shouting out in public your
opinions, promoting your projects. I barely use the DM feature.</p>
<p>Twitter is not different of course from Google & Facebook - they
need to sell ads and your data is used for this, but at least it's
easier to control that you're only pushing public stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Given all of this, I have deleted my Google and Facebook accounts yesterday</strong></p>
<p>(well, for FB unfortunately I reactivated it today because I lost
access to my Spotify Premium account - so until this is solved, my FB
is still active but it's a matter of days.)</p>
<p>All of this if of course is the tip of the iceberg since we eventually
found out that governments can just extract content from the flow that
goes through undersea cables.</p>
<p>But what I am doing is still important. It's a political act that will
shape the future if we're a bunch of people acting like this.
We need to show through our online habits and actions that we care about
our privacy.</p>
<p>On the phone side, I guess I am in a pretty good shape since I use Firefox OS.
The only part that worries me now is the hardware.</p>
<p>Now my next task is to teach my kids how important privacy is, so that they
clearly understand what's going on when they are using the internets.</p>" nil nil "b82597da1bcb1ad50f1abf27d4c472b0") (113 (20936 3254 787161) "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BenjaminKerensaDotComMozilla/~3/CssdPmgryNw/open-source-bridge-2013-day-1-recap" "Benjamin Kerensa: Open Source Bridge 2013: Day 1 Recap" "Benjamin Kerensa" "Wed, 19 Jun 2013 05:43:56 +0000" "<p><a href=\"http://osbridge.org\" target=\"_blank\">Open Source Bridge</a> 2013, an open source conference produced by <a href=\"http://stumptownsyndicate.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Stumptown Syndicate,</a> kicked off today for its 5th annual event in Portland, Oregon.  I spent the entire day and part of the evening networking with attendees and catching some of the amazing sessions and here is my report.</p>
<h3>Keynote</h3>
<p>James Vasile opened this year’s Open Source Bridge with the first keynote of the week and he chose a serious topic: how we are living in an age of surveillance and that we need to create solutions to protect free speech.  Vasile referenced recent events like the Edward Snowden’s leak of the National Security Agency’s PRISM program and Internet Censorship in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Vasile talked fondly of the importance of open tools on the internet and technologies like encryption and pointed out that policy makers will not bring change.</p>
<h3>Sessions of Interest</h3>
<p>The first session of the day I attended was “Taming Your Inner Cowboy Coder – A Simple And Sane DevOps Workflow” a talk given by Greg Lund-Chaix and Evan Heidtmann. The talk discussed the tools and best practices for devops while working in development and production environments.</p>
<p>Next up was “DIY Electric Vehicles” a talk given by Ben Kero who works at Mozilla. Kero had informative slides and a even more informative talk as he shared his expertise in a hobby he has picked up: building DIY Electric Vehicles. Kero decribed the possibilities of making electric-powered bikes and cars and the anatomy of such vehicles and the basics of how to get started.</p>

The talk was packed with great slides and useful information and Kero stayed after to answer questions of people who were interesting in making apps or even porting Firefox OS.</p>
<p>I look forward to day two of Open Source Bridge tomorrow and the 5th Year Anniversary Party this Thursday at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.

I would switch to a Community Flavor and see how it worked and see if I could keep it as my desktop instead of Ubuntu.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The requirements I had for desktop challenge:</p>
<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">
<li>Must be Ubuntu Community Flavor</li>
<li>Firefox shipped as default browser</li>
<li>Preference to lighter weight DE</li>
<li>Solid Support and Dev Sub-Community</li>
<li>Must respect <a href=\"http://blog.sidstamm.com/2012/12/what-is-privacy.html\" target=\"_blank\">privacy</a></li>
</ul>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The conclusion for me based on those requirements was that Xubuntu was the best candidate for my 30-day challenge although I did consider Kubuntu. But their lack of shipping Firefox as a default was a deal breaker for me even though they still have an equally crisp desktop.</p>

a week, to start a new job at Mozilla.</p>
<p>That was a huge change in my life since I had to interact daily with people
in English, cope with the 9 hours timezone and try to keep up the pace of
working with smarter people than me (I am still the dumbest.)</p>
<p>I was the only guy in Europe in the Services team, and had to wait until
7pm to actually chat with my colleagues and exchange info. I had numerous
late nights of work the first year.</p>
<p>But it was worthing the pain: I was the first Python guy in the Services
team and worked to convert the Firefox Sync server to a \"state of the art\"
Python application, along with all the ecosystem around it.</p>
<p>A big challenge I was quite proud of taking. I was trusted to do the
right things and helped the team moving off the PHP version.</p>
<p>The Python launch did not go well because of a bug we could not really
have avoided, and I had a few sleepless nights and nightmares before
everything went back to normal. Eventually, the Python version worked
very well and the next apps were built using the same tools & recipes.</p>
<p>The team grew and more Python folks joined later on. I've learned a lot
during that time and looking back, those stressful weeks were the
best times I had.</p>
<p>Since that first year, a lot of things have changed at Mozilla:
Alexis joined the team and I slowly went back to a normal schedule
since we've managed to start a 'Europe team' and work together.</p>
<p>The new Paris office opened a few months ago and you can feel
that the Europe side of Mozilla is growing big time.</p>
<p>I don't feel like a remote guy away from his office anymore
so that's great :)</p>
<p>These days I am doing a lot of work in building tools for
server-side developers. I should include qa and devops as well.</p>
<p>Namely: Circus, Vaurien, Loads & Cornice.</p>
<p>I love what I am doing and I think those tools are useful
outside our team itself.</p>
<p>Circus & Cornice are starting to get patches from outside
Mozilla so that's great.</p>
<p>Last but not least: Everytime a privacy or a patent scandal
occurs, I am proud that my thoughts & opinions are exactly
the ones that are defended and echoed by Mozilla voices.

One variant that has applications far beyond initial import is contact sharing via Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
It would be great if I could send contacts back and forth between all my devices, including the Firefox OS ones. Other phones usually can send and receive contacts in VCard (.vcf) format via Bluetooth, but Firefox OS so far is missing this functionality (even though some VCard support exists for import from SD card in 1.1, though I could never get that to work for me).<br />
<br />
A reasonably usable implementation for sharing could be implemented as an app: It would need to read from the Contacts API, present a selection to the user, assemble VCard files and send those off via a Web Activity so the existing Bluetooth sharing can act on them. With that, the sending side should work.<br />
The receiving side would be a bit more hacky, but also doable: Unfortunately, the existing Bluetooth support does not call a Web Activity for handling not explicitely supported file types, it only ends up saving them on the SD card. So the contact sharing app would need to periodically look for new VCard files in that location, read and offer to import them, and finally use the Contacts API again to write them into the system's database.<br />
<br />
If someone would pick up the needed work there, I'm sure the app would be quite popular, and I'd love to use it myself. Ultimately, I think this functionality should be part of the official Contacts apps, so having any such app available under a licence that allows Gaia to use the code would be great. Still, I think it would be awesome to have the app so the soon-shipping Firefox-OS-1.0.1-powered devices can use them.<br />

I live it, I breathe it, I was there when it became available to a larger audience at an affordable rate and I have seen it grow more and more to the most interesting, versatile and easiest to participate media out there. I’ve witnessed the power it gives to people who have no voice in traditional media and give people education where their social standing or school system would not support them.</p>
<p>This is why it hurts me to see people squander the opportunity that is the web away by clogging it with short-lived, let’s say it – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE0CRMm59BY\">bullshit</a>. Sure, this is a natural thing – the web is a normal part of our lives and the new generation of users is web-native, meaning they don’t know any longer what it would be like to be offline. When we stop seeing something as hard to get it becomes a commodity and we value it less. Didn’t have to fight for it, so why see it as something I should care for? It is always there, isn’t it? Much like we waste drinking water until we lived in a country where you couldn’t drink from the tap.</p>
<p><img alt=\"didn't read, LOL - apparently something to be proud of…\" src=\"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/198/460/iwkoqt.gif\" width=\"100%\" /></p>
<p>The time when we listened to random beeping sounds from our modems and got excited when we got a full 56KB connection for a change are over. Mobile connectivity is still a problem, and sometimes gets expensive but even then the connection speeds are great. That is when you are in the country where your mobile contract and in “first world” countries. Get out of this world and you still feel the flakiness of connectivity and you get much more grateful for information becoming available after the third exasperated reload of the current web page.</p>
<p>And this is where I get very disappointed when I see that we are moving into a world where people stop using text and words to describe their feelings, ideas and plans and – well, <em>communicate</em> with others. Instead we are confronted with an avalanche of images, memes, animated GIFs of several megabytes and age-old fake conversations, jokes and “inspirational quotes” as badly optimised JPGs full of artifacts. We also get a lot of messages that could be a short post in the form of a video with terrible lighting and bad audio. They are easy to make, but they are much harder to consume. I can skim a long text until it gets interesting. I can not do that with a video unless I have a timed transcript.</p>
<p>I am not even going to start on the accessibility issues that come from a web that consists solely of images and videos. I am talking about incredibly useful technology and systems that are available to us as a result of a just a bit more than a decade of web evolution becoming useless.</p>
<p>Search engines like text. You will get your productions on the web found by having good text in there. Your images and videos can be as amazing as they come – if there is no descriptive text all you get is traffic coming from people seeing your things and sharing them. This can be incredibly powerful – something “going viral” can get you a lot of hits and shares in a very short amount of time and give you the false impression that you are a success and made an impact on the web. But the success is fleeting and a few minutes later the next cool thing will come around. A day later other people will share your work as theirs and again get a quick fix of fame. It is turning the web into a pure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber\">Operant Conditioning Chamber</a>, the same phenomenon that powers casual online gaming and makes people give up on privacy, as explained eloquently by <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxObserver-Cory-Doctorow\">Cory Doctorow in his TEDxObserver talk</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, social sharing also has great benefits beyond the quick fame. People describing your work in their words when sharing can add different language explanations or give your content more impact as an important voice people trust tweeted about it, but it relies on the good-will of people consuming what you produce and making the effort to share it or write words around it. If you provided the words from the beginning, you’ll get this as extra on top of people who will find your work using search engines – because you used text. And even better, if someone gets to your product and doesn’t speak your language, they can use a free translation service to get the product in at least an approximation of their language. We can use web technology to make products more accessible to us without having to rely on a social interaction of someone capable of both languages to do the work for us.</p>
<p>Above all, what bugs me is that the flood of memes, animated GIFs and videos and their quick, false fame robs new users of the web of the opportunity to learn how to speed-read, write and – above all – communicate in writing. I learned English in a few ways. First of all, in school, which works well if your teacher is not a non-native English speaker just trying to get through the curriculum. Secondly, I watched English TV series (Monty Python, as this was the only non-dubbed show) with subtitles. This taught me to understand English and thus – subconsciously – how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>A large part of me learning other languages though was through text communication with people from other countries. First on notes sent on floppy disks in the mail trading demos and tools, then on BBSes and then on the web. Reading and writing comments, hanging out on <span class=\"caps\">IRC</span> and having many a fight and a lot of brainstorming there, taking part in forums and mailing lists, newsgroups and finally in social networks like Facebook and Google+. I could talk to someone on the other side of the globe, in real time, and it didn’t take ages to get a video or suffered from bad audio on a phone call or voice call.</p>
<p>It baffles me to see that we have a world-wide communication network with a very low barrier to entry and nearly no expense on publishing and we don’t use it to better ourselves, to make us better communicators. Instead we complain that governments don’t do enough to make school education better. Today you don’t need to buy a book in another language and wait for it in the mail. You can get it online and read it in Kindle, Google Play books, or even go to <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/‎\">Project Gutenberg</a> and read them for free. And yet people using proper grammar on the web are congratulated for it or – more commonly – made fun of. A higher level of education should not be a surprise in a world that has access to the largest library ever. It should be a given.</p>
<p>Words are powerful, they spark a theatre in the head. People reading your words make their own pictures at a speed pictures could never be transmitted. Instead of giving one image you create a gallery, one that you will never see, but your readers do. And this gallery is very personal to them and thus gets remembered much more. Of course words can cause controversy, misunderstandings and can hurt. But even then they can spark a conversation and make you realise the effect of your actions much more than a “like” or an “upvote” could ever do.</p>
<p>The old saying that a picture says a thousand words is true when it comes to explanations. Re-hashing memes and jumping on bandwagons based on current pop culture references that will be impossible to grasp a month later doesn’t say a thousand words. It basically says “I am lazy, here is a quick laugh to hint at my creativity”. We are blessed to be able to transmit our thoughts to an audience we will never be able to meet physically. We should not squander this.</p>
<p>Please, use your words. Turn on that grammar check, re-read that tweet before you send it. Write a short sentence instead of posting a meme we’ve seen thousands of times before. And don’t get discouraged when people don’t jump on it and thank you or go nuts about it. This is not for fame, this is for you. If all technology fails, words and gestures is what we have. You can exercise and train your brain to paint with words, to create gorgeous constructs. You get better the more you push yourself to not be lazy and use the obvious word but one that is more specific. Words are beautiful. Paint with them, compose with them, woo people with them.</p>

the mail, but hadn't had a chance to open the package until today
(crazy life stuff).</p>
<p>I'm running Debian Testing and had done some Gaia/FirefoxOS work in
late 2012. I had my development environment still set up including adb
and fastboot.</p>
<p>I wanted to switch the phone to the nightly channel which is what I
was using (or thought I was using) with my Unagi. Mostly I followed
<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/06/updating-and-tweaking-your-firefox-os-developer-preview-phonegeeksphone/\">Updating and Tweaking your Firefox OS Developer Preview
phone/Geeksphone</a>.</p>
<p>After doing that, I moved my SIM card over as well as the Micro SD
card I had in my Unagi phone. The Micro SD card has all my media on
it---not my suer data. I thought about moving my user data over, but
I've had the Unagi so long that I figured my user data is probably in
a funky state anyhow and better to start over.</p>
<p>Couple of thoughts:</p>
<ol class=\"arabic simple\">
<li>The nightly build is version 2.0.0-prerelease.</li>
<li>The phone is a lot bigger than the Unagi---it'll take a bit of
getting used to.</li>
<li>Most things worked fine. I even got a marketing message from
T-Mobile minutes after I inserted my SIM card and got on the
network.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few issues (the camera is not working at all). I need to
spend some time with Bugzilla to file those with useful
data. Regardless, the phone is working pretty well and I'm probably
going to switch to it as my primary phone soon. That might give me
some incentive to finish rewriting <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://willkg.github.io/magic10ball/\">magic10ball</a>.</p>

<p>✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈</p>
<p><strong>Stereotype:</strong>  <em>something that may be true about some members of a group, but not all, and yet is applied to all members of the group without regard for the individual. While stereotype might be a scary word to some people, worry not – they are within your control to manipulate, eliminate, and examine thoroughly for holes in logic.</em></p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Debunk your internally held stereotypes, and not just once.</strong></p>
<p>Unpacking a stereotype you’ve held for any length of time is not a ‘set it and forget it’ process.  It came as quite a shock to me this past weekend when I became aware of the deep levels of distrust I had been holding toward new hires within the last 2 years. These are people who were in the ranks of our explosive growth spurt* and when I examined this feeling I saw that I didn’t believe this new bunch of Mozillians could be as hooked, committed, and passionate as myself.</p>
<p>It dawned on me over the course of our intensive 2 days of plenary activities that I held this belief while still going day to day believing what I care most about is bring new people into the community.  And I do care about this, but I see now how my stereotyping might also be holding me back.  When I bring someone into the community or get a chance to passionately wax on how Mozilla has changed my life I like to think I can tell if they are also catching the fever. For me, it’s been such a good pairing of challenging technical work and new areas to practice social justice activism in, so I’ll evangelize to anyone who’s interested while also inquiring with them to discover what area of Mozilla contribution might be a good starting place for them. I expect to see a similar spark of what is possible, working with Mozilla, for their passion. When I’m able, I try to help them network and make connections within the project to help clear barriers to their goals and find a mentor.  Again, that’s based on my experience of coming on board with the help of a strong mentor as well as having social connections to leaders within the organization.</p>
<p>If it’s not apparent yet, I am trying to recreate for others what I saw as the perfect ‘hook’. I believe I have a strong set of core values that align with being Mozillian and I want to install them into others. <strong>Here’s the catch:</strong> becoming a Mozillian isn’t close to how, in a perfect world, one might install a binary package containing certain values into a person and we have no reliable test of whether it patches correctly and provides a guaranteed shared core with each other.</p>
<p>After this weekend, and talking deeply and at great lengths with people who have joined the community in the last two years, who have obvious passion & commitment to the Mozilla mission, I have started unpacked my stereotype of a what makes a new Mozillian passionate and what hooks them.  It’s something I will have to keep reminding myself of.  The reminder will look like asking people what <strong><em>their</em></strong> hook was instead of looking for mine in them.  Knowing logistically that it was impossible for everyone to have my exact experience but trusting they had <strong><em>something</em></strong> to activate them in the ways I felt mattered were not aligning at all until I got to spend this time having what sometimes seemed like the same conversation over and over.  I was with 60 people where at least half of them were brought on in the last two years and yet, the discussions were passionate, committed, and inspiring. I am thankful for our process that it allowed me to have this revelation that will help me be a better Mozillian and community leader in the future.</p>
<p>In the actions I have leading up to the Summit, one is to look closer at the ‘hooks’ of others and to work on how we might abstract & synthesize those into options for new Mozillians to have an activity to engage in where we can be as close as 100% certain as possible that they’ve been activated as Mozillians with the core values we’re wanting to trust each other has. A follow-up post will talk about the core values and their importance to several other big topics for Summit 2013.</p>

Firefox for Android 24 will bring a lot of noticeable improvements for users of TalkBack and alternative Android screen readers. Here’s a round-up of those enhancements and new features:</p>
<h3>Braille</h3>
<p>Firefox 24 brings <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.googlecode.eyesfree.brailleback\">BrailleBack</a> support. The braille output is not merely a mirror of the speech output, but rather a smart representation of the current and surrounding items. You can use the navigational commands of your display to navigate web content, and you can use routing keys to activate the current item. This may activate a link, press a button, toggle a check box, or whatever action an ordinary double-tap or press of the D-pad Enter would also execute.</p>
<h3>New default reading order</h3>
<p>A new order of reading information has been introduced, which may soon become the default reading order for new installs. When activated and TalkBack speaks the current item, it now speaks the name, label or text first, followed by semantic information such as the type (like link, button etc.) and the ancestry. This way, the most important information is spoken first.</p>
<p>If you want to try the new reading order, you can do this by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the address bar, type <a>about:config</a> and press enter.</li>
<li>In the search field, type access.</li>
<li>Look for the entry named accessfu.utterance and double-tap it.</li>
<li>Change its value from 0 to 1.</li>
<li>Close the tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, your reading order will be the new one with the label of the current item first. To change back to the way it was before, follow the above steps and change the value back from 1 to 0.</p>
<h3>Editing text</h3>
<p>Editing text is finally possible in text inputs and text areas of web pages! You can navigate by character, word, and in text areas, paragraph, too. With this, having control over what you’ve written and correcting what you typed is finally possible! I know you were waiting a long time for this! <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.marcozehe.de/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<h3>Text areas now activate</h3>
<p>It was previously not possible to activate many text areas and get a keyboard to input text. This has been fixed. Examples of this bug could be seen in Facebook and Mobile Twitter when trying to compose a status update or tweet.</p>
<h3>Skipping of decorative images</h3>
<p>Images which web authors clearly marked as decorative with the expression <em>alt=”\"</em> are now properly skipped when navigating through web content. This should eliminate a lot of unnecessary stops on graphics which have no meaning for the understanding of the content.</p>
<h3>Better speaking of rich labeled content</h3>
<p>Firefox for Android now properly exposes explicitly given labels of web content instead of always trying to get the label from the inner text of that element. If an aria-label or other means of labelling an element is being used, for example on Facebook or Twitter, it will now be spoken and brailled.</p>
<h3>Popups are announced</h3>
<p>If the activation of an element causes a pop up to appear, this will now be announced. Examples of that are the items for Friend requests, Messages, and Notifications on Facebook.</p>
<h3>Closing all tabs no longer breaks web content support</h3>
<p>There was a bug that caused all web content to no longer be accessible once all tabs had been closed. You had to close and restart Firefox for Android to get TalkBack support working again. This has been fixed.</p>
<h3>Double-tap and hold in web content</h3>
<p>There was a bug that you could not use the double-tap and hold gesture to bring up the context menu for any given web element with TalkBack. This has been fixed, and you can now access all the features of those context menus.</p>
<h3>Door hangers retain focus</h3>
<p>There was a bug in the door hanger notifications, like the Save Password prompt, that caused focus to get lost frequently. This has been fixed.</p>
<h3>More changes</h3>
<p>There have been quite some more changes under the hood you will not notice immediately, but which all add to a much better user experience.</p>
<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>A big thank you goes out to Max, who is a summer intern at Mozilla this year, and to Yura, who is a very active community contributor. And of course to Eitan, whose main work is concentrated on getting Firefox OS accessibility in shape, but who always finds the energy to keep the rest of us in check when we hack on Firefox for Android! <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.marcozehe.de/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<h3>So when will you get it?</h3>
<p>Firefox 24 will hit the Play Store in August as <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox_beta\">Firefox Beta</a>, and in September as the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox\">final release</a>. If you’re on Firefox <a href=\"http://nightly.mozilla.org\">Nightly builds</a>, you already have all these great enhancements on your device. And if you’re using <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/aurora/\">Aurora</a>, you’ll get it in the week of June 24, 2013.</p>
<p>We hope that you’ll enjoy these enhancements and definitely value your feedback! Also keep those bug reports coming, they are very helpful and will assist us in making Firefox for Android and Firefox OS even better!</p>

<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Il était une fois un projet de logiciel libre (ou, d’ailleurs, un projet associatif). Un jour, un anonyme se présenta et annonça qu’il souhaitait aider. C’était une bonne nouvelle, car le projet avait bien besoin de contributeurs supplémentaires. Les contributeurs existants avaient justement préparé des documents pour guider des nouveaux venus et étaient prêts à répondre aux questions de l’anonyme. L’anonyme suivit le guide de contribution. Après avoir suivi ce guide, l’anonyme chercha à quoi il pouvait bien contribuer. Malheureusement, au bout de quelques jours ou quelques semaines, l’anonyme n’avait pas trouvé en quoi il pouvait aider et il disparût.</em></p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Malgré tous les efforts des contributeurs existants, l’histoire est toujours aussi triste. Alors que faire pour arriver à une fin heureuse ?</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Il était une fois un projet de logiciel libre (ou, d’ailleurs, un projet associatif). Comme dans tous les projets de ce genre, il y avait énormément de choses à faire et pas assez de contributeurs pour tout accomplir. Les contributeurs avaient pris pour habitude de noter sur une liste de tâche facilement accessible tout ce qu’ils n’avaient pas encore eu le temps de mener à bien. Certaines de ces tâches étaient accessibles à des nouveaux venus. Pensant aux futurs contributeurs, les contributeurs existants s’assuraient donc que ces tâches accessibles étaient faciles à trouver et que n’importe quel nouveau venu pouvait facilement contacter la personne qui avait ajouté la tâche dans la liste, pour lui demander des conseils. De plus, les contributeurs existants avaient préparé des documents pour guider des nouveaux venus et étaient prêts à répondre aux questions de l’anonyme. L’anonyme suivit le guide de contribution, qui le mena à des tâches accessibles. Il trouva une tâche qui l’intéressait et un mentor pour l’aider à démarrer.

<h3>Le système des bugs mentorés</h3>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chez Mozilla, nous utilisons depuis quelques années le système que je viens de décrire, avec un succès impressionnant. Tous les quelques jours, sur les projets que je suis, de nouveaux contributeurs se présentent, suivent les tutoriels, choisissent une tâche, se mettent immédiatement au travail – et finissent la plupart du temps par publier leurs contributions, et un peu plus tard par devenir eux-mêmes mentors sur d’autres tâches.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Marquer une tâche comme mentoré prend environ deux secondes.</p>
<ol>
<li>je viens d’ouvrir un bug sur Bugzilla et je réalise qu’un débutant pourrait certainement le traiter avec un peu d’aide ;</li>
<li>j’ajoute dans le champ libre (« whiteboard ») du bug l’information [mentor=Yoric] – à partir de ce moment-là, les nouveaux venus peuvent trouver ce bug dans notre moteur de recherche de bugs mentorés ;</li>
<li>j’en profite pour ajouter dans ce même champ libre l’information [lang=js][lang=c++] – à partir de ce moment-là, les nouveaux venus cherchant des bugs dans l’une des deux technologies “JavaScript” ou “C++” verront s’afficher ce bug ;</li>
<li>c’est fini – un de ces jours, un contributeur me contactera peut-être pour demander s’il peut travailler sur ce bug.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bien entendu, l’exemple utilise Bugzilla et des contributions techniques mais il est assez simple d’étendre le système à d’autres gestionnaires de tâches et à des tâches purement non techniques.</p>
<p>Pour un nouveau venu, commencer est aussi très simple :</p>
<ol>
<li>lire <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/introduction\">notre document d’introduction</a> et suivre le lien vers <a href=\"http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/?unowned=1\">le moteur de recherche de bugs mentorés</a> ;</li>
<li>choisir des centres d’intérêt et un bug ;</li>
<li>contacter le mentor par mail ou par irc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Certaines étapes peuvent encore être fluidifiées (le nom et l’adresse du mentor ne sont pas toujours évidents à trouver à l’écran, etc.) mais c’est en cours. Nous espérons que le système pourra, à terme, être généralisé à tous les projets de Mozilla, techniques ou non.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Du coup, si vous participez à un projet (Mozilla ou autre) qui n’emploie pas un tel système de bugs mentorés et qui cherche des contributeurs, je vous invite vivement à essayer.</p>

Under the description “Firefox <span class=\"caps\">OS </span>- the platform <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> deserves” (a slogan I used in a few talks and interviews already) these videos are meant to explain a few things:</p>
<p></p><ul><li>What Firefox OS is</li><li>How it is different to any other mobile platform</li><li>What it means for <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> as a movement</li><li>How you can be part of it</li><li>What its benefits are to you (a stable <span class=\"caps\">HTML5</span> platform with full hardware access aimed at a completely new and huge market of end users)</li><li>How to get started</li><li>Where to find documentation and file complaints and enhancement ideas</li></ul><p></p>
<p>All in all, we thought a series of videos would be a good way to get the message out that scales better than talks and posts. Each of the videos will be about five minutes long and an interview/conversation between experts and me, namely in this case Daniel Appelquist (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/torgo\"> @torgo</a>) from <a href=\"http://blog.digital.telefonica.com\">Téléfonica Digital</a>/ <span class=\"caps\">W3C</span> and Desigan Chinniah (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/cyberdees\"> @cyberdees</a>) from Mozilla.

<p>We are a group of very smart people. Don’t ever doubt that for a second. We are a hit-the-ground-running bunch of doers who really like <strong>actionable items</strong> and <strong>clear instructions</strong> as well as <strong>accountability</strong> and <strong>deliverables</strong>. Oh and throw in some <strong>metrics</strong> and a <strong>post-mortem</strong> so we can iterate, please. This makes us <em>very</em> challenging for outsiders to work with, especially when trying to engage a sizable group in open process activities. Turns out we’ll ask a lot of questions to clarify instructions, search high and low for actionable items, and demand deliverables. We’ll interrupt process, we’ll doubt the value of the process, and we’ll assume even before attempting that it is too open-ended to be of value or to generate the tangible items we’re craving as the proof our time was well spent.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If we go too far down that path in this unconference style of meetup, we will lose out tremendously on letting ourselves be changed and engaged by each other.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, asking each other “is this making sense to you?” or “are we doing it right?”,  that uncertainty IS a big part of process. Asking each other questions, being confused together, not knowing what’s coming next <strong>together </strong>is a form of bonding.</p>
<p>Bonding – which I shall refer to from now on as friendship – typically strengthens over equal parts of time spent together + common interests + shared experience. Sometimes you can fast forward a friendship by just overloading one of those areas. Having a particularly intense experience with someone (eg: riding a roller coaster), spending a lot of consecutive time (eg: traveling together), and connecting intensely on a common interest (eg: hacking) are all examples of ways to ramp up the development of a strong bond with another human. When attending a Summit we are provided a multitude of opportunities to have many of those three with a variety of Mozillians we normally might not interact with, and sometimes with ones we do – deepening connections is the ‘bonus’ to the work we get done when we assemble en masse. My most remembered experiences at Summits, All-Hands’, Moz Camp, and other larger gatherings with Mozillians have always been about the micro interactions which are not  part of the schedule. Walking to dinner, sitting on the bus, playing Rock Band – those are opportunities to look at the person or people around you and to try to make sure you’re getting to know even a little bit about them.</p>
<p>In the very earliest part of our process for the weekend of discovery and digging into the meat of what should drive our Summit planning a question came up about whether we could affect the decision to have the Summit in 3 different geo-locations.  Just that one little detail was something many people were tripping over and wanted to discuss and it was clear our dive into the weekend’s process would be held up until there were <em>answers</em>. What ended up happening was Mardi explained how logistically they had looked at previous Summits & large gatherings and had determined that 600 people seemed to be the largest number of Mozillians in one place where there still could be a ‘cozy’ feeling that allows for the kind of bonding previously mentioned.  Once Mardi said this, I was changed.  I, too, had wondered about the dispersal but now it made sense to me that the importance of connection between Mozillians had been placed before the need to put us all in one location and  I appreciated getting this new perspective on what the process had accomplished already.</p>
<p>Mitchell then spoke about how sometimes we get hung up on comparing one thing to another and are quite vocal if we find it wanting.  It’s important for us to have this gathering, this alignment exercise for the project as a whole, and if we don’t want to call it a ‘Summit’ because it’s not everyone in one physical space then call it something else in your head.  I found her point to be very inspiring and concluded that it’s important to go to this 2013 gathering – at whichever location – and <strong>BE</strong> there.  Do not waste time comparing it to other events, attend the event you’re at and reflect later. For me, this was when I knew I could trust the weekend’s activities would lead to great things and more changes of my tightly held beliefs I came into the weekend with.  There will be more about this in future posts.</p>
<p>Thanks, Process.</p>

--not recently though-- and I've also been lightly involved in the
FOSDEM Python room this year.</p>
<p>There's one thing that frustrated me a lot in this exercise:
the inability to reach out specific people in the Python community.</p>
<p>I was never really able to answer questions like this:</p>
<ul class=\"simple\">
<li>I want a list of all Numpy specialists in Europe that are willing to
give a talk.</li>
<li>I want a list of all women developers that are willing to give
a talk about Python in Europe.</li>
<li>I want a list of experts that can help me selecting the
right talks for a given topic.</li>
<li>I want to know who loves Python in Burgundy!</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course you can shout out on a blog, on twitter, or try to reach
the right people through your network.</p>
<p>For the second question --reaching out women-- I've learnt too
late that I should've worked with the PyLadies on this, or
even the Ada initiative.</p>
<p>But this is too much work. I just want to reach out the right
<strong>people</strong> without having to go through a lot of intermediates.</p>
<p>I want to have a single place on the internets where Bob and
Sarah can add a list of topics they are involved into, tell if
they are interested in giving talks, in what area of the world,
etc.</p>
<p>I think it can't be Lanyard because they would probably not
let me query their users database with specific queries
like the ones I mentioned. It can't be Linkedin for the same
reasons.</p>
<p>I was pointed to some directories that looked a bit like
what I envisioned, but they were local directories that just
listed Python people without giving all the info I
am looking for.</p>
<p>So what I think the Python community is missing is a
<strong>worldwide Pythoneers directory</strong> that is not affiliated to any
group, organization, company or foundation -- were users can
fill out a profile with their interests in Python.</p>
<p>So I am going to try to build that tool during the
next Europython in Italy.</p>
<p>The features I want are pretty simple:</p>
<ul class=\"simple\">
<li>the ability to connect with your github or bitbucket
account.</li>
<li>the ability to build a page about you, a little bit
like about.me, but with predefined, <em>optional</em> fields
like your gender, your location, the projects you are
involved into, and so on.</li>
<li>the ability for someone to query & reach out
a specific group of people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this raises some issues, like the fact that
it could be used by commercial companies to send some
unsollicited e-mails like recruiting e-mails, or
simple spams. But people are already used to deal with
this as soon as they have a public life.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this, reach me out or add a
comment. The goal will be to talk about the idea, refine it,
and have a first version running by the end of Europython,
and see if we get somewhere.</p>" nil nil "f43d17729e1af7c059e07e5395e39ccc") (96 (20931 19014 920780) "http://mozakai.blogspot.com/2013/06/what-asmjs-is-and-what-asmjs-isnt.html" "Alon Zakai: What asm.js is and what asm.js isn't" "azakai" "Thu, 20 Jun 2013 17:34:38 +0000" "This is going to be a bit long, so <b>tl;dr</b> asm.js is a  formalization of a pattern of JavaScript that has been developing in a  natural way over years. It isn't a new VM or a new JIT or anything like that.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://asmjs.org/\">asm.js</a> is a <b>subset of JavaScript</b>, defined with the goal of being <b>easily  optimizable</b> and used primarily as a <b>compiler target</b> from languages like  C and C++. I've seen some recent online discussions where people appear  to misunderstand what those things mean, which motivated me to write this post, where I'll give my perspective on asm.js together with some context and history.<br /><br />The first thing worth mentioning here is that  compiling into JavaScript is nothing new. It's been done since at least  <b>2006</b> with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/\">Google Web Toolkit</a> (GWT) which can compile Java into  JavaScript (GWT also does a lot more, it's a complete toolkit for  writing complex clientside apps, but I'll focus on the compiler part of  it). Many other compilers from various languages to JavaScript have  shown up since then, for both existing languages like C++ and C#, to new  languages like CoffeeScript, TypeScript and Dart.<br /><br />Compiled code  (that is, JavaScript that is the output of a compiler) can look odd.  It's often not in a form that we would be likely to write by hand. And  each compiler has a particular pattern or style of code that it emits:  For example, a compiler can translate classes in one language into  JavaScript classes using prototypal inheritance (which might look a little more like \"typical\" JS), or it can implement  those classes with function calls without inheritance (passing  \"this\" manually; this might look a little less \"typical\"), etc. Each compiler has a way in which it works, and  that gives it a particular pattern of output.<br /><br />Different patterns  of JavaScript can run at different speeds in different engines. This is  obvious of course. On one specific benchmark a JS engine can be faster than another, but in general no JS engine is \"the fastest\", because different  benchmarks can test different things - use of classes, garbage  collection, integer math, etc. When comparing JS engines, one can be better on  one of those aspects and slower on another, because optimizing for them can be quite separate. Look at the individual  parts of benchmarks on <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/\">AWFY</a> for example (click \"breakdown\"), and you'll see that.<br /><br />The  same is true for compiled code: different JS engines can be faster or  slower on particular patterns of compiled code. For example, it was  recently noticed that <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=870627\">Chrome is sometimes much faster than Firefox on GWT-generated code</a>; as you can see in the bug there, recent  work has narrowed the gap. There is nothing odd about that: one JS  engine was faster than another on a particular pattern, and work was  done to catch up. This is how things work.<br /><br />Aside from Java, which  GWT compiles, another important language is C++. There have been at  least two compilers from C++ to JavaScript in existence over the last  few years, <a href=\"http://emscripten.org/\">Emscripten</a> and <a href=\"http://mandreel.com/\">Mandreel</a>. They are separate  projects and quite different in many ways - for example, Emscripten is  open source and targets just JavaScript, while Mandreel is closed source  and can target other things as well like Flash - but over a few years  they converged on basically the same pattern of JavaScript for compiled  C++ code. That pattern involves using a <b>singleton typed array</b> to  represent memory, and <b>bitwise operations</b> (<span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">|0</span>, etc.) to get values to  behave like C++ integers (the JavaScript language only has doubles).<br /><br />We might say that Emscripten and Mandreel \"discovered\" a useful pattern of JavaScript, where \"discovered\" means the same as when Crockford discovered JSON. Of course typed arrays, bitwise ops and JavaScript Object Notation syntax all existed earlier, but noticing particular ways in which they can be especially useful is significant. Today it feels very natural to use JSON as a data interchange format - it almost feels like it was originally designed to be used in that manner, even though of course it was not - and likewise, if you are writing a compiler from C++ to JavaScript, it is natural to use <span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">|0</span> and a singleton typed array to do so.<br /><br />Luckily for the Emscripten/Mandreel pattern, that type of code benefits  from many years of work that went into JavaScript engines. For example,  they are all very good at optimizing code whose types do not change, and  the Emscripten/Mandreel pattern generates code that is implicitly  statically typed, since it originated as statically typed C++, so in  fact types should not change. Likewise, the bitwise operators that are  important in the Emscripten/Mandreel pattern appeared in crypto tests in major benchmarks like SunSpider, so they  are already well-optimized for.<br /><br />In other words, the  Emscripten/Mandreel pattern of code could be quite fast due to it  focusing on things that JS engines <b>already</b> did well. This isn't a  coincidence of course, as both Emscripten and Mandreel tested in  browsers and decided to generate code that ran as quickly as possible. Then, as the output of these compilers was increasingly  used on the web, browsers started to optimize for them in more specific  ways. Google added a benchmark of Mandreel code to the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/octane/benchmark\">Octane benchmark</a>  (the successor to the popular V8 benchmark), and both Chrome and Firefox  have optimized for both Mandreel and Emscripten for some time now (as a quick search in their bug trackers can show). So  the Emscripten/Mandreel pattern became yet another pattern of JavaScript  that JavaScript engines optimize for, alongside all the others which  are represented in the familiar benchmarks: SunSpider, Octane, Kraken,  etc. This was all a very natural process.<br /><br />Here is where we get to  asm.js. While Emscripten/Mandreel code can run quickly, there was still  some gap between it and native code. The gap was not huge - in many  cases it ran just <b>3x</b> slower than native code, which is pretty close to,  say, Java - but still problematic in some cases (for example,  high-performances games). So Mozilla began a research project to  investigate ways to narrow that gap. <a href=\"https://github.com/dherman/asm.js/\">Developed in the open</a>, asm.js started to <b>formally define</b> the Emscripten/Mandreel  pattern as a type system. Formalizing it made us think about all the  corner cases, and we found various places in Emscripten/Mandreel code  where types could change at runtime, which is contrary to the goal of  the pattern, and can make things slower. asm.js's goal was to get rid of  all those pitfalls.<br /><br />The <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/mloc_emscripten_talk/#/27\">first set of benchmark results</a> was promising - execution close to <b>2x</b> slower than native, even  on larger benchmarks. Achieving that speedup in Firefox took just 1  engineer only 3 months, since it <b>doesn't</b> require a new VM or a new JIT,  it only required adding some additional optimizations to Firefox's  existing JS engine. Soon after, Google showed very large speedups on asm.js code as well, as noted in the IO keynote and as you can <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/#machine=11&view=breakdown&suite=asmjs-apps\">see on AWFY</a>. (In fact, over the last few days there have been several speedups noticeable there on both browsers - these  improvements are happening as we speak!) Again, these large speedups in  two browsers were achieved quickly because no new VM or JIT was written,  just additional optimizations to <b>existing</b> JS VMs. So it would be  incorrect to say that asm.js is a \"new VM\".<br /><br />I've also seen people  say that asm.js is a new \"web technology\". Loosely speaking, I suppose  we could use that term, but only if we understand that if we say \"asm.js  is a web technology\" then that is totally different from when we say  \"WebGL is a web technology\". Something like WebGL is in fact what we  normally call a \"web technology\" - it was standardized, and browsers  need to decide to support it and then do work to implement it. asm.js,  on the other hand, is a certain <b>pattern</b> of  compiled code in JavaScript, which is already standardized and supported. asm.js, just like GWT's output pattern, does not need to  be standardized, nor do browsers need to \"support\" it, nor to  standardize whatever optimizations they perform for it. Browsers already  support JavaScript and compete on JavaScript speed, so asm.js, GWT  output, CoffeeScript output, etc., all work in them and are optimized to  varying degrees.<br /><br />Regarding the term \"support\": As before, I  suppose we can loosely talk about browsers \"supporting\" asm.js, but we  need to be sure what we mean. On the one hand, when we talk about WebGL  then it is clear what we mean when we say something like \"IE10 does not  support WebGL\". But if we say \"a browser supports asm.js\", we intend  something very different - I guess people using that phrase mean  something like \"a browser that spent some time to optimize for asm.js\".  But I don't see people saying \"a browser supports GWT output\", so I  suspect that using the term \"support\" comes from the mistaken notion  that asm.js is something more than a pattern of JavaScript, which is not  the case.<br /><br />Why, then, do some people apparently still think  asm.js is anything more than a pattern of JavaScript? I can't be sure,  but here are some possibilities and clarifications to them:<br /><br /><b>1.</b> asm.js code basically defines a low-level VM, in a sense: There is a singleton array for \"memory\" and all the operations are on that. While true, it is also true for Emscripten and Mandreel output, and other compilers as well. So in some sense this is valid to say, but just in the general sense that we can implement VMs in JavaScript (or any Turing-complete language), which of course we can regardless of asm.js.<br /><br /><b>2.</b> Some of the initial speedups from  asm.js were surprisingly large, and it felt like a big jump from the  current speed of JavaScript, not an incremental step like things  normally progress. And big jumps often require something \"new\",  something large and standalone. But as I mentioned above, this was  actually a very gradual process. Relevant optimizations for Emscripten/Mandreel  code have taken years, writing SSA-optimizing JITs like CrankShaft and  IonMonkey have likewise taken years (there is overlap between these two statements, of course), and the speedups on asm.js code are  due to those long-term projects being able to really shine on a code  pattern that is easy for them to optimize. In fact, many of the recent  optimizations to speed up asm.js code do not actually add new  optimizations directly, instead they change whether the browser decides  to fully optimize it - that is, they get the code to <b>actually reach</b> the  optimizing JIT (CrankShaft, IonMonkey, etc.). The power of those  optimizing JITs has been there for a while now, but sometimes heuristics  prevented it from being used.<br /><br /><b>3.</b> A related thing is that I sometimes see people say that asm.js code will be \"unusably slow\" on browsers that do not optimize for it in a special way (just today I saw such a comment on hacker news, for example). First of all this is just false: look at <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/#machine=11&view=breakdown&suite=asmjs-ubench\">these</a> <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/#machine=11&view=breakdown&suite=asmjs-apps\">benchmarks</a>, it is clear that on many of them Firefox and Chrome have essentially the same performance, and where there is a difference, it is noticeably decreasing. But aside from the fact that it is false, it is also disrespectful to the JavaScript VM engineers at Google, Microsoft and Apple: To say that asm.js code will be \"unusably slow\" on browsers other than Firefox implies that  those other VM devs can't match a level of performance that was shown to be possible by their peers. That is a ridiculous thing to say given how talented those devs are, which has been proven countless times.<br /><br />If someone says it will be \"unusably slow\" not because they <i>can't</i> reach the same speed but because they <i>won't</i>, then that looks obviously false. Why would any browser decide to not optimize for a type of JavaScript that is being used - including in high-profile things like <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">Epic Citadel</a> - and has relevant benchmarks? All browsers want to be fast on everything, this is a very competitive field, and we have already seen Google optimize for asm.js code as mentioned earlier in the IO keynote; there are also some <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Charles/Anders-Hejlsberg-Steve-Lucco-and-Luke-Hoban-Inside-TypeScript-09\">positive signs</a> from Microsoft as well.<br /><br /><b>4.</b> Another possible reason is that  the asm.js optimization module in Firefox is called OdinMonkey (mentioned for example in <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/luke/2013/03/21/asm-js-in-firefox-nightly/\">this blogpost</a>). SpiderMonkey, Firefox's JavaScript  engine, has called its JITs with Monkey-related names: TraceMonkey, JaegerMonkey and  IonMonkey (although, baseline is a new JIT that received no Monkey name,  so there is definitely no consistency here). So perhaps OdinMonkey sounds like  it could be a new JIT, which seems to imply that asm.js optimizations  require a new JIT. But as mentioned in that blogpost, OdinMonkey is <b>not</b> a  new JIT, instead it is a module that sits alongside the rest of the  parts of the JavaScript engine. What OdinMonkey does is detect the  presence of asm.js code, take the parse tree that the normal parser  emitted, type check the parse tree, and then send that information into  the existing IonMonkey optimizing compiler. All the code optimization  and code generation of IonMonkey are still being used, no new JIT for  asm.js was written. That's why, as mentioned before, writing OdinMonkey only took one engineer 3 month's work (while also working on the spec). Writing a new JIT would take much more  time and effort!<br /><br /><b>5.</b> Also possibly related is the fact that  OdinMonkey uses the \"use asm\" hint to decide to type check the code.  This is indeed a bit odd, and feels wrong to some people. I certainly  understand that feeling, in fact when working on the design of asm.js I  argued against it. The alternative would be to do some heuristic check:  Does this block of code not contain anything impossible in asm.js (no  throw statements, for example), and does it contain a singleton typed  array, etc.? If so, then start to type check in OdinMonkey. This could  achieve practically the same result in my opinion. It does, however,  have some downsides - heuristics are sometimes wrong and often add overhead, and really this optimization won't \"luckily work\" on  random code, instead it will be expected and intended by a person using a  C++ to JS compiler, so why not have them note that intention - which are strong arguments for using an explicit hint.<br /><br />The important thing is that \"use asm\" does not affect JS semantics (if it does in some case - and new optimizations often do cause bugs in odd corner cases - then that must be fixed just like any other correctness bug). That means that JavaScript engines can ignore it, and if it is ultimately determined to be useless by JS engines then we can just stop emitting it.<br /><br /><b>6. </b>asm.js has a spec, and defines a type  system. That seems much more \"formal\" than, say, the output pattern of  GWT, and furthermore things that <b>do</b> have specs are generally things  like IndexedDB and WebGL, that is, web technologies that need to be  standardized and so forth. I think this implies to some people that  asm.js is more like WebGL than just a pattern of JavaScript. But not  everything with a spec has it for standardization purposes. As mentioned  before, one reason for writing a spec and type system for asm.js was to  really force us to think about every detail, in order to get rid of all  the places where types can change, and other stuff that prevents  optimizations. There are 4 other reasons that IMO justified the  effort to write a spec:<br /><br />* Having a spec makes it  easy to communicate things to other people. As I mentioned before, GWT  output often used to run (and maybe still does) faster in Chrome than  Firefox, and I am not really sure why (probably multiple reasons). GWT  and Chrome are two projects from the same company, so it would not be  surprising if their devs talk to each other privately, and there would  be nothing wrong with it if they did. Emscripten and Firefox are, like  GWT and Chromium, two open source projects primarily developed by a  single browser vendor, so there is sort of a parallel situation here. To avoid the downsides of private discussions, we felt that writing a spec for asm.js would give us the benefit of being  able to say \"<b>this (with all the technical details) is why this code  runs fast in Firefox</b>.\" That means that if other browser vendors want to  run that code quickly, then they have all the docs they need in order to  do so, and on the other side of things, if other compilers like  Mandreel want to benefit from those speedups, then once more they have  all the information they need as well. Writing a spec (and doing so in the open) makes things public and  transparent.<br /><br />* Having a type system opens up the possibility to  do <b>ahead of time (AOT)</b> compilation in a reasonable way. Note that AOT  should have already been possible in the output patterns for Emscripten  and Mandreel (remember, they are generated from C++, that is AOTed), but  actually wasn't because of the few places where types could in fact  change. Assuming we did things properly, asm.js should have no such  possible type changes anymore, so AOT is possible. And a type system  makes it not just possible but quite reasonable to actually do so in  practice.<br /><br />AOT can be very useful in reducing the overhead and risk of optimization heuristics. As mentioned before, in some cases code never even reaches the optimizing JIT due to heuristics not making the optimal decision, and furthermore, collecting the data for those heuristics (how long a function or loop executes, type info for variables, etc.) adds overhead (during a warmup phase before full optimization, and possibly later during deoptimization and recompilation). If code can be compiled in an AOT manner, we simply avoid those two problems: we optimize everything, and we do so immediately. (There is a potential downside, however, in that fully optimizing large amounts of code can take significant time; in Firefox this is partially mitigated by things like compilation using multiple cores, another possibility is to consider falling back to the baseline JIT for particularly slow-to-compile functions.)<br /><br />Because of these benefits of AOT compilation, it can avoid the \"stutter\" problem - where a game pauses or slows down briefly when new code is executed (like when a new level in the game is begun that uses some new mechanics or effects), due to some new code being detected as hot and then optimized, at the precise time when it is needed to be fast. Stutter can be quite problematic, as it tends to happen at the worst possible times - when something interesting happens - and I've often heard game devs be concerned about it. AOT compilation fully optimizes all the code ahead of time, so the stutter problem is avoided.<br /><br />A further benefit of AOT is that it gives predictable performance: we know that all the code will be fully optimized, so we can be reasonably confident of performance in a new benchmark we have never tested on, since we do not rely on heuristics to decide what to optimize and when. This has been shown repeatedly when AOT compilation in Firefox achieved good performance the very first time we ran it on a new codebase or benchmark, for example on <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">Epic Citadel</a>, <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/lua.vm.js/lua.vm.js.html\">a compiled Lua VM</a>, and others. In my JavaScript benchmarking experiences in the past, that has been rare.<br /><br />AOT therefore brings several benefits. But with all that said, it is an implementation detail, one possible approach among others. As JS engines continue to investigate ways to run this type of code even better, we will likely see more experimentation in this area.<br /><br />*  Last reason for writing the spec and type system: asm.js began as a  research project, and we might want to publish a paper about it at some  point. (This one is much less important than the other three, but since I wrote out the others, might as well be complete.)<br /><br />That sums up point 6, why asm.js has a spec and type system. Finally, two last possible reasons why people might mistakenly think asm.js is a new VM or something like that:<br /><br /><b>7. </b>Math.imul. Math.imul is something that came up during the design of asm.js, that did actually turn into a proposal for standardization (for ES6), and has been implemented in at least Firefox and Chrome so far. Some people seem to think that asm.js relies on Math.imul, which would imply that asm.js relies on new language features in JavaScript. While Math.imul is helpful, it is entirely optional. It makes only a tiny impact on benchmarks, and is super-easy to polyfill (which emscripten does). Perhaps it would have been simpler to not propose it and just use the polyfill code, to avoid any possible confusion. But Math.imul is so simple to define (multiply two 32-bit numbers properly, return the lower 32 bits), and is basically the only integer math operation that cannot be implemented in a natural way in JS (the remarkable thing is that all the others <b>do</b> have a natural way to be expressed, even though JavaScript does not have integer types!), so it just felt like a shame not to.<br /><br />It's important to stress that if Math.imul were opposed by the JavaScript community, it would of course not have been used by asm.js - asm.js is a subset of JavaScript, it can't use anything nonstandard. It goes without saying though that new things are being discussed for standardization in JavaScript all the time, and if there are things that could be useful for compiled C++ code, then such things are worth discussing in the JavaScript community and standards bodies.<br /><br /><b>8.</b> Finally, asm.js and Google's <a href=\"http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl/building-and-testing-portable-native-client\">portable native client</a> (PNaCl) share the goal of  enabling C++ code to run safely on the web at near-native speeds. So it  is perhaps not surprising that some people have written blogposts  comparing them. And aside from that shared goal, there are some other  similarities, like both utilizing LLVM in some manner. But to compare  them as if they were two competing <b>products</b> - that is, as if they  directly compete with each other, and one's success may be at the  other's detriment - is, I think, irrelevant. PNaCl (and PPAPI, the pepper plugin API on which it depends) is a proposed web  technology, something that needs to be standardized with support from  multiple vendors if it is to be part of the web, and asm.js on the other  hand is just a pattern of JavaScript, something that is already  supported in all modern browsers. asm.js code is being optimized for  right now, just like many patterns of JavaScript are, driven by the  browser speed race. So asm.js will continue to run faster over time,  <b>regardless</b> of what happens with other things like PNaCl: I don't see a  realistic scenario where PNaCl somehow makes browser vendors decide to  stop competing on JavaScript speed (other plugin technologies like Flash, Java, Silverlight, Unity, etc. did not).<br /><br />All of this has nothing to do  with how good PNaCl is. (Worth mentioning here that I consider it to be  an impressive feat of engineering, and I have a huge amount of respect  for the engineers working on it.) It is simply operating in a different  area. The JavaScript speed race is very important right now in the  browser market: When your browser runs something slower than another  browser, that's something that you are naturally motivated to improve.  This happens with benchmarks (we already saw big speedups on two  browsers on asm.js code), and it happens with things like the Epic  Citadel demo (it initially did not run at all in Chrome, but Google  quickly fixed things). This kind of stuff will continue to happen on the  web and drive asm.js performance, and as already mentioned, this is  regardless of what happens with PNaCl.<br /><br /><b>Are things really that simple?</b><br /><b><br /></b>I've  been saying that asm.js is just a pattern of JavaScript and nothing  more, and the speedups on it are part of the normal JavaScript speed  competition that leads browser vendors to optimize various patterns. But  actually things are more complicated than that. I would not  argue that <b>any</b> pattern should be optimized for, nor that it would be  ok for a vendor to specifically optimize based on hints for an <b>arbitrary</b> subset of JavaScript.<br /><br />To make my  point, consider the following extreme hypothetical example: A browser  vendor decides to optimize a little subset of JS that has a JS array for  memory, and stores either integers or strings into it. For example,<br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">function WTF(print) {<br />  'use WTF';<br />  var mem = [];<br />  function run(arg) {<br />    mem[20] = arg;<br />    var a = 100;<br />    mem[5] = a;<br />    a = 'hello';<br />    mem[11] = a;<br />    print(mem[5]);<br />    mem[5] = mem[11];<br />    a = arg;<br />    return a;<br />  }<br />  return run;<br />}</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\"><br /></span>Call  this <b>WTF.js</b>. So when 'use WTF' is present, the browser checks that  there is a singleton array called mem and so forth, and can then optimize the WTF.js code very well: mem is in a closure and does not escape, so we know its  identity statically; we also know it should be implemented  as a hash table because it likely has holes in its indexes; we know it  can contain only ints or strings so some custom super-specialized data structure might be useful here; etc. etc. Again, this is an example meant to be extreme and  ridiculous, but you can imagine that such a pattern might be useful as a  compilation target for some odd language.<br /><br />What is wrong with  WTF.js is that while it is JavaScript, it is a <b>terrible</b> kind of  JavaScript, in the following ways. In particular it violates basic principles of how current JavaScript  engines optimize: for starters, variables are given more than one type (both locals  and elements in mem). This is exactly what JS engine devs have been  telling us all <b>not</b> to do for years now. Also, this subset comes out of  nowhere - I can't think of anything like it, and when I tried to give it  a hypothetical justification in the previous paragraph, I had to really  reach. And there are obvious ways to make this more reasonable, for  example to use consecutive indexes from 0 in the \"mem\" array, so there are no holes - this is something else that JS engine devs have been telling us to do for a  very long time - and so forth. So WTF.js is in fact WTF-worthy.<br /><br />None  of that is the case with asm.js. As I detailed before, asm.js is the  latest development in a <b>natural</b> process that has been going on in the  JavaScript world for several years: Multiple compilers from C++ to JS  appeared spontaneously, later they converged on the subset of JS that  they target, and later JS engines optimized for that subset as it became more common on the web. While <span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">|0</span>  might look odd to you, it wasn't invented for asm.js. It was  \"discovered\" independently multiple times way before asm.js, found to be useful, and JS  engines optimized for it. This process was not directed by anyone; it  happened organically.<br /><br />These principles guided us while designing  early versions of asm.js: There were code patterns that were even easier  to optimize, but they were novel, sometimes bizarre, and most  importantly, they ran poorly without special optimizations for them,  that did not exist yet. When I felt that a proposed pattern was of that nature, I strongly opposed it. Emscripten and  Mandreel code already ran quite well; to design a new pattern that could  be much faster with special optimizations, but right now is  significantly slower without them, is a bad idea - it would feel unfair  and WTF-like.<br /><br />Therefore as we designed asm.js we tested on JS engines  without any special optimizations for it, primarily on Chrome and on  Firefox with the WIP optimizations turned off. asm.js is one output mode  in Emscripten, so we had a good basis for comparison: when we flip the  switch and go from the old Emscripten output pattern to asm.js, do things get  faster or slower? (Note btw that we lack something similar in the WTF.js  example from before, which is another problem with WTF.js.) What we saw was that (when we avoided the more  novel ideas I mentioned before, that were rejected), flipping the switch  from the old pattern to asm.js generally had little effect, sometimes  helping and sometimes hurting, but overall things stayed at much the same (quite good) level of performance JS engines already had. That made sense, because asm.js is very  close to the old pattern. (My guess is that the cases where it helped  were ones where asm.js's extra-careful avoidance of types changing at  runtime made a positive difference, and cases where it hurt were ones  where it happened to hit an unlucky case in the heuristics being used by  the JS engine.)<br /><br />A few months ago Emscripten's default code generation mode switched to asm.js. Like most significant changes it was discussed on the mailing list and irc, and I was happy to see that we did not get reports of slowdowns in other browsers as a result of the change, which is further evidence that we got that part right. In fact (aside from the usual miscellaneous bugs following any significant change in a large project), the main regression caused by that change was that we got reports of startup slowdowns in <i>Firefox</i> actually! (These were caused by AOT sometimes being sluggish, it was however very easy to get large speedups on it, following those bug reports.)<br /><br />Developing and shipping optimizations for something bizarre like WTF.js would be selfish, since it benefits one  vendor while arbitrarily, unexpectedly and needlessly harming perf in other vendor's  browsers. But none of that is the case with asm.js, which builds on a naturally-occurring pattern of  JavaScript (the Emscripten/Mandreel pattern, already optimized for by JS engines), was designed to not harm performance on other browsers compared to that already-existing pattern, and as benchmarks have shown on two browsers already, creates  opportunities for significant speedups on the web.<br /><br />" nil nil "d2d33ead1600eeaee1fbf5f80c698578") (95 (20931 1828 786402) "http://blog.kaibray.com/post/53435217912" "Kat Braybrooke: Creativity Is the Goal at Mozilla's #MakerParty" nil "Thu, 20 Jun 2013 12:49:00 +0000" "<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://webmaker.org/img/img-Party-feature.jpg\" width=\"450px\" /></p>

<p></p><h3>Stage attire/clothing</h3><p></p>
<p>You will read a lot of things by clever people about “dressing better than the audience to give you a position of authority” and other – possibly true in some environments but so not in all – tips and tricks, but here are some things I found work very well for me:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Take off your lanyard/badge</strong> – it’ll reflect in the light of a stage and look odd on photos. Furthermore, if you use a lapel mic the lanyard will keep banging against it making clicking sounds or muffling your recording. I tend to put my name tag on my hip, threading the lanyard as a loop through the hoops of my trousers (I know, not possible when you wear a dress – just take the badge off before you get mic-ed up).</li><li><strong>Provide a space to clip the mic to</strong> – this is why button down shirts and polos are better than T-Shirts. You can clip the mic on them without having to thread the cable through the whole shirt, out of the neck and back to the middle of your chest where it should be</li><li><strong>Avoid stripes or loud patterns</strong> – they take away people’s attention to a degree but more importantly look terrible on photos and video as they cause a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern\">Moiré pattern effect</a>. A great example of that is the <a href=\"http://store-uk.hugoboss.com/Regular-Fit-cotton-polo-shirt-%27Bugnara-20%27/hbeu50243613,en_GB,pd.html&cgid=22300#!i%3D8%26color%3D453_Light-Pastel-Blue\">Hugo Boss site</a>, where it is impossible to see the texture of some shirts even in zoom because of this effect.</li><li><strong>Dark is good</strong> – you will probably sweat on stage, either because of the heat from the lamps or because you are nervous. Dark shirts don’t show sweat stains. Remember <a href=\"http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121120035045/grifball/images/c/cf/Developers.gif\">Developers, Developers, Developers</a>? The other way to deal with this is to wear a hoodie/jacket/blazer to cover up</li><li><strong>Keep a bit of space</strong> – very tight fitting clothing might show your perfect figure but it can also be distracting or in the case of largely built men intimidating. This is not a date, you are here to deliver some great content.</li><li><strong>Empty your pockets</strong> – you will need them to put the wireless transmitter of the lapel mic, it looks better to have no unsightly bulges and there won’t be the sound of clinking coins or keys in your pocket.</li><li><strong>Leave your mobile behind</strong> – a call or message during your talk can really change the flow of your talk. Furthermore, the buzz of the phone trying to find a connection will be audible on your microphone. An exception to this is of course when you want to show stuff on the phone or bring it up as a surprise. Even then turn it into flight mode. Some people also use the phone and alarms to tell them when there is only 10 minutes left in your talk. That could cause issues with the audio, too, so leave that to a friend in the audience or ask the organisers to have a clock on stage.</li></ul><p></p>
<p></p><h3>Audio equipment/microphones</h3><p></p>
<p>In some rooms you can make do without a microphone at all, but that is not always the case and you need to be a trained speaker to be loud but not detrimental to your vocal cords. Here are some things to be aware of when it comes to microphone technology:</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Wireless lapel microphones</strong> – these are awesome and by far my favourite. As mentioned earlier, make sure they don’t end up next to anything that could cause click sounds, like buttons, tie-clips or your lanyard. Other than that, having those is the best thing you can get as they give you the most mobility on stage and are very simple to put on and take off. Try to get mic-ed up as soon as possible, as wiring them under your shirt is a bit intrusive and you might want to check your looks afterwards again (if that is important to you). Make sure they are muted when you are not on stage yet and that you turn them on just before. As my colleague Robert Nyman put it “You just don’t know what weird sounds your body is capable of until you get wired up”. Also you don’t want conversations you have with people before your talk be transmitted or recorded (well other than by the <span class=\"caps\">NSA</span>)</li><li><strong>Behind the ear microphones</strong> – these are a bit trickier, but yield very good sound results. Make sure that the mic doesn’t scratch against your beard stubbles, do not wear large ear-rings that might clink against them and take off your glasses, put the mic on and then put the glasses on top of them. I always found these microphones to be not really comfortable as they can cut into the back of your ear and limit your head movement a bit. Be aware of that.</li><li><strong>Handheld microphones</strong> – these seem intrusive as one of your hands needs always to be close to your mouth and effectively covering your chest – thus not allowing for large, inviting open gestures with both arms – but they can be great. If you are not too comfortable a speaker yet, they are something to hold onto on stage and keep your hands from randomly moving around or shaking. Also, they just work without people having to fiddle with your hair, glasses or other attire.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>As a strong rule of thumb – show love to the audio folk of the venue you speak at. They know their stuff and it is up to them for you to be audible by the audience. Follow their advice and make their life easier and you’ll give a great talk.</p>
<p></p><h3>Available stage tech</h3><p></p>
<p>Last but not least, here are some things on technology available for you on stage.</p>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Bring your own power cables and adapters</strong> – not every venue or conference is equipped with all the things you need</li><li><strong>Do not expect audio or video playback to be available</strong> – many a time I saw speakers building up to “a great video” just to be forced to show a blank rectangle or something without sound</li><li><strong>You will be offline</strong> – just give up on the promise of connectivity on stage. A good speaker does not need it and there is nothing more discouraging than seeing someone who is there to inspire you about the awesomeness of cloud services struggling with the wireless crapping out</li><li><strong>Plan for low resolution</strong> – 1024*768 at 60hz is normally possible, higher, not so much. So plan your demos and slides to be readable and usable on that resolution</li><li><strong>Bring your own remote/clicker</strong> – these are awesome. First of all it means you will not be glued to and hidden behind your computer. Secondly you have something in your hand (see handheld microphone above for the benefits of that). Thirdly they have laser pointers which is great to get rid of stray cats that may enter the stage</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Long time no see! I’ve been busy outside the blog-sphere and I’ve got some news to share. First of all, I upgraded my Firefox Add-on to version 0.1.7. So here is the link:</p>
<p><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-html5-switch/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"YouTube HTML5 Switch\"><br />

<p>All in all, the important addition is that <strong>you can now use the hotkey Control+Y</strong> instead of pushing the button on the toolbar. Plus, I think it now has no other issues for most new versions of Firefox. I need to point out that I get most of the help from the SDK’s documentation which is great, but, to anyone interested, don’t hesitate to contribute to its content! Restartless add-ons rule!</p>
<p>You may use it and see if it works on YouTube (yeah it works, at least for Firefox 21.0 w/ Fedora Linux) using this video:</p>

Jon Ippolito from the University of Maine wrote up <a href=\"http://www.blog.still-water.net/2013/05/the-ex-files-how-long-will-our-software-last/\">a great summary of who was there and what we discussed</a>, so I won't go into those details and leave you with his words on that.<br />
<br />
Instead, I'll do multiple short posts on my impressions and thoughts of the event and the subject, probably over the next few weeks.<br />
<br />
The attendance consistent mostly of people from the existing software preservation community in the US, the majority of those people knew (of) each other already, apparently. In addition, we had some people from the software creation community - Microsoft's (sole) archivist probably belongs to both the preservation and software communities, then we had a guy from GitHub, and finally, <a href=\"https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/ottodv/\">Otto</a> and me from Mozilla.<br />
<br />
One thing that I learned with regard to the preservation community is that there are basically three types of projects they operate: museums, archives, and libraries.<br />
<br />
Museums only collect a small collection of large milestones in history, but try to get as much on those as possible so they can build up a great exhibit for the public to learn about our and their past.<br />
Archives build up large collections of items with the main intent of preserving them as ideally as possible and usually without any intent to provide them to the public, the items are only available to sporadic researchers. There may be metadata collected on the items that may be available to a larger public, though.<br />
Libraries are somewhat in between: They build up larger collections of items and try to preserve them, but with the intent of some public to have regular access to them, often in a very controlled manner, e.g. via reading rooms.<br />
<br />
On this software preservation summit, we had a number of representatives of all three kinds of projects: Museums such as the Computer History Museum, the Museum of Modern Art or the MIT Museum, archives such as Microsoft's, NIST's NSRL (National Software Reference Library - yes, \"Library\" is a bit of a misnomer there) or the Internet Archive, and libraries such as the Astrophysics Source Code Library, university libraries or, of course, the Library of Congress.<br />
<br />
In terms of software preservation, we found that those different organizations and those doing different kinds of collections, can not just learn from each other, they can also help each other: Not every one of them wants every piece of software coming in, depending on what exactly they collect, so it may make sense to forward some pieces to other projects.<br />
<br />
It was interesting for us as outsiders to the preservation community to see what those people are doing and how they are organized. In future posts, I'll get more into how and where we as software producers can work with them." nil nil "86befb4b7ea05a3dba0546f1551832af") (89 (20930 47210 103405) "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/InPursuitOfMysteries/Mozilla/~3/bTXs7Na1QdE/" "Al Billings: Cal's Dreambox" nil "Wed, 19 Jun 2013 22:56:09 +0000" "<p>A few weeks ago, it was announced that there was now a 3D printing vending machine over at UC, Berkeley (aka \"Cal\") now. This is the creation of <a href=\"http://3dreambox.com/\">Dreambox</a>, some startup or somesuch doing 3D printing vending machines. Without a lot of data, I sent my trusty minion (I mean \"friend\"), <a href=\"http://zedlopez.com/\">Zed Lopez</a>, over to take a look at it for me. He took a few photos with his phone and I put them up as a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157634077943904/\">flickr set</a>.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/9021270666/\" title=\"IMG_20130611_141435 by albill, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"IMG_20130611_141435\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3793/9021270666_d7b25b56a5_z.jpg\" width=\"480\" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, the Dreambox basically consists of a Replicator 1 from Makerbot Industries (I mean <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/19/3d-printing-giant-stratasys-acquires-makerbot/\">Stratasys</a>) in a box that dumps prints into the drawers beneath it. Dreambox has put up <a href=\"http://youtu.be/w4nPPKKpy1U\">a video</a> which helpfully shows their process:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>
<p>While I'm happy to see more exposure to 3D printing for the public, this whole thing seems like a bit of a bad idea. Printers like this that print in plastic are notoriously finicky things, with prints often coming out badly if conditions aren't right or if the printer is simply not maintained and cleaned well. I don't know how an unattended Replicator 1 sitting in a box is going to do well with printing materials on a reliably basis. I certainly wouldn't want to own this Dreambox and have to maintain it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>There is some hope that the machine will be upgraded or better though. I got a note from Dreambox this morning (where I had made an account) mentioning that the whole machine was going offline at the end of this week while they upgraded it. I assume they are going to make some changes to make it more reliably, maybe upgrading the printer to a new model.</p>
<p>If anyone makes any prints on this machine, I'd love to hear more about how the process was for you as a normal user.</p>

That became the basis of a <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/firefox-developer-tool-features-for-firefox-23/\">post</a> on <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/\">Hacks</a> describing the features in that release. If learning to use advanced search features in Bugzilla doesn’t sound like your kind of thing, don’t worry, you don’t have to read it!</p>
<p>This is how to create that list of bugs using Bugzilla, the Page Inspector in Firefox Developer Tools and maybe a bit of Scratchpad to fix the styling.</p>
<p>Since we have a lot of components in Firefox Developer Tools land, I’m going to use the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi?query_format=advanced\">Bugzilla Search</a> interface rather than the more convenient <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=quicksearch.html\">Quicksearch API</a>. You can certainly use that, but for this job, I think the Search screen is a bit easier.</p>
<p>First, setup your components. Your lists should look like this:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://robcee.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-19-at-2.55.58-PM.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-06-19 at 2.55.58 PM\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-184\" height=\"172\" src=\"http://robcee.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-19-at-2.55.58-PM.png\" width=\"1130\" /></a>Note that I’ve selected RESOLVED, VERIFIED and CLOSED for my Status and FIXED for my resolution.</p>
<p>Next, click the Search by History option and enter the date range between this merge and the last. In this case, May 13th to June 24th.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://robcee.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-19-at-2.58.37-PM.png\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-06-19 at 2.58.37 PM\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-185\" height=\"155\" src=\"http://robcee.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-19-at-2.58.37-PM.png\" width=\"595\" /></a>Now you should be able to hit the Search button at the bottom of the page and get back a list of bugs. Sweet!</p>
<p>If you want to grab the list to plop into a blog post or Your Publishing Venue of Choice, you can open up the Page Inspector on this page (right click, Inspect Element, navigate the breadcrumbs until you find the table element) and then right clicking the element and picking “copy outer html”. This’ll copy the entire page fragment onto your clipboard for pasting into your editor.</p>
<p>You might want to select a different set of columns first. I just use Bug ID and Summary.</p>
<p>If you want to add or change the existing styling on the table rows, you can open a Scratchpad or Console and do something like:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: javascript; gutter: false\">[].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll(\"tr\"),
(row) => row.removeAttribute(\"class\"));</pre>

<blockquote cite=\"https://brendaneich.com/2013/05/c-is-for-cookie/\">
<p><b>False positives</b>. For example, say you visit a site named <code>foo.com</code>, which embeds cookie-setting content from a site named <code>foocdn.com</code>. With the patch, Firefox sets cookies from <code>foo.com</code> because you visited it, yet blocks cookies from <code>foocdn.com</code> because you never visited <code>foocdn.com</code> directly, even though there is actually just one company behind both sites.</p>
<p><b>False negatives</b>. Meanwhile, in the other direction, just because you visit a site once does not mean you are ok with it tracking you all over the Internet on unrelated sites, forever more. Suppose you click on an ad by accident, for example. Or a site you trust directly starts setting <a href=\"http://blog.sidstamm.com/2013/03/what-ever-happened-to-second-party.html\">third-party cookies</a> you do not want.</p>
<p>Our challenge is to find a way to address these sorts of cases. We are looking for more granularity than deciding automatically and exclusively based upon whether you visit a site or not, although that is often a good place to start the decision process. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The logic driving us along the path to a better default third-party cookie policy looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li> We want a third-party cookie policy that better protects privacy and encourages transparency.
</li><li> Naive visited-based blocking results in significant false negative and false positive errors.
</li><li> We need an exception management mechanism to refine the visited-based blocking verdicts.
</li><li> This exception mechanism cannot rely solely on the user in the loop, managing exceptions by hand. (When Safari users run into a false positive, they are advised to disable the block, and apparently many do so, permanently.)
</li><li> The only credible alternative is a centralized block-list (to cure false negatives) and allow-list (for false positives) service.
</li></ol>
<p>I’m very pleased that <a href=\"https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/aleecia-mcdonald\">Aleecia McDonald</a> of the <a href=\"https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/\">Center for Internet and Society</a> at Stanford has <a href=\"http://cch.law.stanford.edu/press/\">launched</a> just such a list-based exception mechanism, the <a href=\"http://cch.law.stanford.edu\">Cookie Clearinghouse</a> (CCH).</p>
<p>Today Mozilla is committing to work with Aleecia and the <a href=\"http://cch.law.stanford.edu/advisory-board/\">CCH Advisory Board</a>, whose members include <a href=\"http://www.opera.com/\">Opera Software</a>, to develop the CCH so that browsers can use its lists to manage exceptions to a visited-based third-party cookie block.</p>
<p>The CCH proposal is at an early stage, so we crave feedback. This means we will hold the visited-based cookie-blocking patch in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/aurora/\">Firefox Aurora</a> while we bring up CCH and its Firefox integration, and test them.</p>
<p>Of course, browsers would cache the block- and allow-lists, just as we do for <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/phishing-protection/\">safe browsing</a>. I won’t try to anticipate or restate details here, since we’re just starting. Please see the <a href=\"http://cch.law.stanford.edu\">CCH</a> site for the latest.</p>

<p>Mozilla, like most operations, has the Repositories of Record (RoR) set
to only allow “fast forward” updates when new code is landed. In order
to fast forward merge, the tip of the destination repository (RoR) must
be an ancestor of the commit being pushed from the source repository. In
the discussion below, it will be useful to say if a repository is
“ahead”, “behind”, or “equal” to another. These states are defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class=\"simple\">
<li>If the tip of the two repositories are the same reference, then
the two repositories are said to be <em>equal</em> (‘<strong>e</strong>‘ in table
below)</li>
<li>Else if the tip of the upstream repository is a ancestor of the
tip of the destination repository, the upstream is defined to be
<em>behind</em> (‘<strong>B</strong>‘ in table below) the source repository</li>
<li>Otherwise, the upstream repository is <em>ahead</em> (‘<strong>A</strong>‘ in table
below) of the source repository.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Landing a change in the normal (2 repository case: RoR and lander’s
repository), the process is logically (assuming no network issues):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class=\"arabic\">
<li><p class=\"first\">Make sure lander’s repository is equivalent to RoR (start with
equality)</p>
</li>
<li><p class=\"first\">Apply the changes (RoR is now “Behind” the local repository)</p>
</li>
<li><dl class=\"first docutils\">
<dt>Push the changes to the RoR</dt>
<dd><ul class=\"first last\">
<li><p class=\"first\">if the push succeeds, then stop. (equality restored)</p>
</li>
<li><p class=\"first\">if the push fails, simultaneous landings were being attempted,
and you lost the race.</p>
<p>When simultaneous landings are attempted, only one will succeed,
and the others will need to repeat the landing attempt. The
RoR is now “Ahead” of the local repository, and the new
upstream changes will need to be incorporated, logically as:</p>
<ol class=\"loweralpha simple\">
<li>Remove the local changes (“patch -R”, “git stash”, “hg
import”, etc.).</li>
<li>Pull the changes from RoR (will apply cleanly, equality restored)</li>
<li>Continue from step 2 above</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When an authorized committer wants to land a change set on an
hg RoR from git, there are three repositories involved. These are the
<em>RoR</em>, the <em>git</em> repository the lander is working in, and internal
<em>hggit</em> used for translation. The sections below describe how this
affects the normal case above.</p>
<div class=\"section\" id=\"land-from-git-happy-path\">
<h4>Land from git – Happy Path</h4>
<p>On the happy path (no commit collisions, no network issues), the steps
are identical to the normal path above. The git commands executed by the
lander are set by the tool chain to perform any additional operations
needed.</p>
</div>
<div class=\"section\" id=\"land-from-git-commit-collision\">
<h4>Land from git – Commit Collision</h4>
<p>Occasionally, multiple people will try to land commits simultaneously,
and a commit collision will occur (steps 3a, 3b, & 3c above). As long as the
collision is noticed and dealt with before addition changes are
committed to the git repository, the tooling will unapply the change to
the internal hggit repository.</p>
</div>
<div class=\"section\" id=\"land-from-git-sad-path\">
<h4>Land from git – Sad Path</h4>
<p>In real life, network connections fail, power outages occur, and other
gremlins create the need to deal with “sad paths”. The following
sections are only needed when we’re neither on the happy path nor
experiencing a normal commit collision.</p>
<p>Because these cases cover every possible case of disaster recovery, it
can appear more complex than it is. While there are multiple (6)
different sad paths, only one will be in play for a given repository.
And the maximum number of operations to recover is only three (3).  The
relationship between each pair of repositories determines the correct
actions to take to restore the repositories to a known, consistent
state. The static case is simply:</p>

<p class=\"first admonition-title\">Note</p>
<ol class=\"last arabic simple\">
<li>The simplistic diagram assumes no changes to RoR during the
duration of the recovery (not a valid assumption for real
life). See the text for information on dealing with the
changes.</li>
<li>States “BB” & “BA” are not shown, as they represent invalid
states that may require restoring portions of the system
from backup before proceeding.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>In reality, it is impractical to guarantee the RoR is static during
recovery steps. That can be dealt with by applying the process described
in the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"http://dtor.com/halfire/2013/06/19/inter_repo_actions.html#diagram-1\">flowchart to restore equality</a> and using the tables below to
locate the actions.</p>
<p>The primary goal is to ensure correctness based on the RoR. The
secondary goal is to make the interim repository as invisible as possible.</p>

"michal berman" "Wed, 19 Jun 2013 15:02:01 +0000" "<p>As an executive coach, I’ve seen people’s careers transformed by coaching. Many of the world's most admired companies, from Google to Goldman Sachs, invest in coaching, and annual spending on coaching in the U.S. is estimated at roughly $1 billion, <a href=\"http://hbr.org/2009/01/what-can-coaches-do-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"HBR what is coaching\">according to Harvard Business Review</a>. Yet I find that many people still don’t know what executive coaching is, how it works and what it can do for them. Here’s some insight.</p>
<p><strong>Coaching defined</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, coaching is personal training that helps professionals reach their goals, no matter where they are in the workforce – entry-level, CEO and everything in between. Much like a personal trainer works your body, an executive coach works your mind, helping you develop the mental strength, emotional intelligence and instinctive ability to problem solve and relate with others in the workplace. </p>
<p>Coaching uses a proven methodology of inquiry, called <a href=\"http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&cad=rja&ved=0CFQQFjAH&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecoaches.com%2Fresources%2Ftoolkit%2Fpdfs%2F31-Powerful-Questions.pdf&ei=JtrAUdLbF8uvqwGC1YGIBw&usg=AFQjCNF7kKAcduSBkeSZUP4AtbInroJSRw&sig2=ja3Il-8ahylIA8Q3LpRrFA&bvm=bv.48175248,d.aWM\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"powerful questions\">powerful questions</a>, that’s been around for decades. The process is designed to leverage your unique personality and strengths, and it does so not by giving you the answers but by helping you learn to ask and answer the right questions on your own throughout your career’s myriad challenges.</p>
<p>The profession is governed by the <a href=\"http://www.coachfederation.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ICF\">International Coach Federation</a> and has several internationally renowned schools, such as the one I attended: <a href=\"http://www.thecoaches.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CTI\">The Coaches Training Institute</a>, the largest and oldest coach training school in the world. </p>
<p>What can an executive coach do for you?</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Be a trusted sounding board.</strong></p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I have found that most leaders thrive when they have a trusted guide who has walked in their shoes and is a truly unbiased source of feedback. Very few career and workplace challenges are brand new; a person’s experience or lack thereof is usually the variable. A good coach has no skin in the game other than your success as you’ve defined it, and will help you anticipate, problem-solve and build internal partnerships with the skill of a seasoned professional. </p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Support you with transitioning to a new role or career.</strong></p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">With most new roles come high expectations and unfamiliar territory, such as managing former peers or taking on managerial duties after years of virtual autonomy. <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201208/why-every-ceo-needs-coach?page=2\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Psychology Today on Coaching\">Research shows</a> when someone assumes a new or different leadership role, <strong>they have a 40% chance of demonstrating disappointing performance</strong>, and <strong>82% of newly appointed leaders derail</strong> because they fail to build partnerships with subordinates and peers. An executive coach will help you transition effectively and build others’ trust in your ability to do the job.</p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Reveal derailing behaviour or blind spots. </strong></p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">According to Harvard Business Review, 2 out of 5 new CEOs fail in their first 18 months on the job – not for lack of competence, but due to hubris and other self-limiting behaviors. Whether you’re a CEO or receptionist, understanding the impact you have with your actions versus the impact you <em>want</em> to have can literally make the difference between being good and being great at what you do. Sometimes discovering a blind spot means helping people uncover their true purpose or higher calling, along with the fears that prevent them from acknowledging and acting on it.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that a good coach – versus a mentor, colleague, therapist or even a trusted friend – will hold you accountable for reaching your goals and will play an active role in helping you achieve your desired success. </p>
<p><strong>Shared rewards</strong></p>
<p>After decades of success working with many talented leaders at some of the world’s best-known brands, I decided to make my own transition to executive coaching and I am thrilled to have just passed my CTI written exam. </p>
<p>As a coach, I’m trained to ask the questions that compel people to achieve what they truly want. Watching that transformation in my clients has made me completely fall in love with the practice of coaching. What I love most is that those who seek coaching are naturally capable human beings who can overcome and soar beyond their imaginations. And when they do, it’s miraculous for both of us. </p>
<p>The coaching methodology itself pushes me to continuously improve both in my coaching and in my life, so I get to practice what I preach. Coaching speaks to my values as a person – eg, about being, at times, fiercely courageous in holding my clients accountable to achieving their goals and I love the simplicity and purity of that design. </p>

</li><li><strong>#checkins-per-day:</strong> We had <strong>293 checkins</strong> checkins on 21may. During May, 21-of-31 days had over 200 checkins-per-day – thats almost every working day. Only 7-of-31 days had over 250 checkins-per-day, much lower than usual. Unusually, we never exceeded 300 checkins-per-day any day this month – first time in many months.
</li><li><strong>#checkins-per-hour:</strong> Checkins are still mostly mid-day PT/afternoon ET. For 5 of every 24 hours, we sustained over 10 checkins per hour. Heaviest load time this month was 1pm-2pm PT (12.5 checkins-per-hour).
</li>
<p>As usual, our build pool handled the load well, with >95% of all builds consistently being started within 15mins. Our test pool continues to improve. All the hard work by RelEng, ATeam and IT is paying off, we’re seeing more test jobs being handled with better response times. The peak for May was 54,195 test jobs on 23may. Still more work to be done here, but encouraging. </p>
<p>As always, if you know of any test suites that no longer need to be run per-checkin, please let us know so we can immediately reduce the load a little. Also, if you know of any test suites which are perma-orange, and hidden on tbpl.m.o, please let us know – thats the worst of both worlds – using up scarce CPU time and not being displayed. We’ll make sure to file bugs to get tests fixed, or disabled – every little bit helps put scarce test CPU to better use.
</p></ul>
<p><strong>mozilla-inbound, birch/b2g-inbound, mozilla-central, fx-team:</strong><br />
Ratios of checkins across these branches remain fairly consistent. mozilla-inbound continues to be heavily used as an integration branch, dropping slightly to 24.2% of all checkins, yet still consistently far more then all other integration branches combined. mozilla-central increased slightly to 2.3% of checkins.</p>
<p>The “birch as b2g-inbound” experiment continued to be a great success, and with 4.2% of this month’s checkins landing here, birch has already become the 4th busiest branch (after try, mozilla-inbound and gaia-central). Birch is also helping reduce pain of any mozilla-inbound closures, and further proving the lure of sheriff-assisted-landings to developers. Given the success of this experiment, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875989\">bug#875989</a> tracks setting up b2g-inbound on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>The lure of sheriff assistance continues to be consistently popular, and as usual, very few people land directly on mozilla-central these days. The fx-team branch saw an increase to 2.1% of checkins, which I believe can be attributed to the increased help with landings from sheriffs (and sometimes gps) this month.</p>

<li><strong>Pushes per day</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can clearly see weekends through the month. Its worth noting that we had >200 checkins-per-day almost every working day in May. This<br />
has been true for a few months now, so it is starting to feel like 200 checkins-per-day is the new “normal” for Mozilla. <a href=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_05_pushes.png\"><img alt=\"#Pushes this month\" src=\"http://oduinn.com/images/2013/blog_2013_05_pushes.png\" width=\"400\"\" /></a><p></p>

<h3>Keynote</h3>
<p>James Vasile opened this year’s Open Source Bridge with the first keynote of the week and he chose a serious topic: how we are living in an age of surveillance and that we need to create solutions to protect free speech.  Vasile referenced recent events like the Edward Snowden’s leak of the National Security Agency’s PRISM program and Internet Censorship in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Vasile talked fondly of the importance of open tools on the internet and technologies like encryption and pointed out that policy makers will not bring change.</p>
<h3>Sessions of Interest</h3>
<p>The first session of the day I attended was “Taming Your Inner Cowboy Coder – A Simple And Sane DevOps Workflow” a talk given by Greg Lund-Chaix and Evan Heidtmann. The talk discussed the tools and best practices for devops while working in development and production environments.</p>
<p>Next up was “DIY Electric Vehicles” a talk given by Ben Kero who works at Mozilla. Kero had informative slides and a even more informative talk as he shared his expertise in a hobby he has picked up: building DIY Electric Vehicles. Kero decribed the possibilities of making electric-powered bikes and cars and the anatomy of such vehicles and the basics of how to get started.</p>

The talk was packed with great slides and useful information and Kero stayed after to answer questions of people who were interesting in making apps or even porting Firefox OS.</p>
<p>I look forward to day two of Open Source Bridge tomorrow and the 5th Year Anniversary Party this Thursday at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.

The Android GDB (JimDB) <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android/GDB\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android/GDB\">Wiki</a> and <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~nchen/jimdb/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~nchen/jimdb/\">pre-built binaries</a> now include instructions and support for Android on x86. Not only is it useful on the growing number of x86 devices, it is also useful on the x86 emulator included in the Android SDK (for developers without access to a device). Presently, the x86 version is entirely separate form the ARM version - you would need both versions in different directories if you have devices on both platforms.
</p>
<p>
The updated GDB also has limited support for on-demand decompression on Android. If you've been noticing random seg faults when debugging Fennec, the new version will ignore these seg faults. See <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android/GDB#Random_segmentation_faults_when_debugging_Fennec\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android/GDB#Random_segmentation_faults_when_debugging_Fennec\">\"Random segmentation faults when debugging Fennec\"</a> and <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android/GDB#monitor_set_ignore-ondemand\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android/GDB#monitor_set_ignore-ondemand\">\"monitor set ignore-ondemand\"</a> in the Wiki for more information.
</p>
<p>
Next up, I will be working on offering a B2G version of JimDB with similar functionality and benefits as the Android version.

<p>Long time no see! I’ve been busy outside the blog-sphere and I’ve got some news to share. First of all, I upgraded my Firefox Add-on to version 0.1.7. So here is the link:</p>
<p><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-html5-switch/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"YouTube HTML5 Switch\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-html5-switch/</a></p>
<p>All in all, the important addition is that <strong>you can now use the hotkey Control+Y</strong> instead of pushing the button on the toolbar. Plus, I think it now has no other issues for most new versions of Firefox. I need to point out that I get most of the help from the SDK’s documentation which is great, but, to anyone interested, don’t hesitate to contribute to its content! Restartless add-ons rule!</p>
<p>You may use it and see if it works on YouTube (yeah it works, at least for Firefox 21.0 w/ Fedora Linux) using this video:</p>
<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block;\"></span>
<p>Yes! It’s the first video of the <a href=\"http://wonkydollandtheecho.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bandcamp page of Wonky Doll and the Echo\">band</a> I play with, directed by Kostas Gounaris. Cool huh? <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<p>I hope you’ll like it as we put a lot of effort to complete it and guess what? There’s also going to be a short film based on the song. I’ll let you know!</p>

Eslam Mostafa (SoC), Shivani Podar (OWP) and Sai Suman Prayaga (SoC) all three of them deserved they internships, showing dedication and patching like crazy before SoC, keeping Vadim, Guillaume and me very busy.</p>
<p>Also I would like to welcome Arnel Borja and Fabiano Fidêncio to the team with their immense contributions, and ofcourse the allmighty Giovanni Campagna (who hacks everything in GNOME by now)</p>
<p>The last couple of weeks have been very hectic here, nevertheless we triumphed over phase of one of developing GNOME Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><del><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714; color: #333333;\">Set basic infrastructure</span></del></li>
<li><del><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714; color: #333333;\">Implement Grilo Querying</span></del></li>
<li><del><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714; color: #333333;\">Implement Albums View</span></del></li>
<li><del><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714; color: #333333;\">Implement Songs View</span></del></li>

<li><del><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714; color: #333333;\">Implement Playback support</span></del></li>
<li><del><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714; color: #333333;\">Clean up and port to Glade</span></del></li>
</ul>
<p>Now phase 2 is shaping up nicely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement Playlist View</li>
<li>Implement Selection functionality on all views</li>
<li>Implement Repeat/Shuffle</li>
<li>Implement Actions</li>
<li>Clean up</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you are interested in joining us with the development please feel free to hang out with us on #gnome-music on irc.gnome.org</p>

<p>I often find myself in situations where I have multiple tabs that I opened only to look at for short periods of time. Sometimes I reach this state while reading articles on Hacker News or looking at funny pictures on Reddit. At the end of looking at the tabs, it would be nice if Firefox had a way to close these ephemeral tabs so you can get back to your previous work quicker.</p>
<p><img alt=\"Close Tabs to The Right\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3225\" src=\"http://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/2013-06-14_1336.png?w=480\" style=\"border: 4px solid rgb(34,34,34); margin: 1em auto;\" /></p>
<p>Well, Firefox now does! If you open lots of tabs from Reddit and then want to close all of the tabs to the right of Reddit, just right-click on the Reddit tab and choose “Close Tabs to the Right”. It’s easy and quick!</p>
<p>Why “close tabs to the right” and not “close tabs to the left”? When we open new tabs they appear on the end, and so naturally tabs that have a longer lifetime end up being promoted to the start-side of the bar. This leads us towards the situation where closing tabs “to the right” is a simple way of closing the ephemeral tabs.</p>
<p>Users who are using Firefox with a right-to-left locale such as Hebrew or Arabic should see the equivalent “Close Tabs to the Left” feature.</p>

<p>This week-end took place in Mozilla’s Paris office the Summit 2013 planning assembly: a gathering of about 65 people from all around the world and representing all areas of the Mozilla project, with both paid staff and volunteers, aimed to plan and shape the next Summit, that will take place the first week-end of October in Bruxelles, Toronto and Santa Clara.</p>
<p>TL;DR: it’s been a great assembly. If we manage to accomplish at the next Summit half of the things we’ve discussed in this week-end, it will have been the best Mozilla event ever.</p>
<p>The aim of the assembly was not to define a schedule for the event and fix everything but to talk about which are the important topics that animate the Mozilla project these days, start to discuss them and shape them in a way so that we can come out with a good format for the Summit to address them and try to give and propose solutions for them. To do this, all the planning committee has taken interviews to fellow Mozillians in the last month to have a wider view of which is the temperature of the project in these days and act as a representative for the comments expressed.</p>
<p>I went to Paris without a clear idea of what we would have accomplished there, but I’m impressed with the result we had.<br />
First of all, this assembly was facilitated by people of <a href=\"http://www.unconference.net\">unconference.net</a>, who proposed a peculiar way to proceed with it. I was a bit skeptic with the method proposed, but it turned out that some of their <a href=\"http://www.unconference.net/methods/\">methods</a> are really great (like unpanel) and we will definitely adopt them for the next Summit, while some others still look like rubbish (I may still be proved wrong).<br />
The second important fact is that we talked little about technology and a lot about Mozilla, its community, its communication (internal and external) and the interactions between its components and people. On one hand, as Gandalf pointed out, this is a sign that we trust implicitly our technology and the fact that it will be discussed at the Summit, because this is a big portion of what Mozilla is about. On the other hand, it’s a sign that there’s a general awareness, not only among community members but also (finally) among employees and paid staff and board of directors that we have communication problems between the different parts of the projects and especially between paid staff and volunteers, and the time is now mature to address and try to solve them. What I’m talking about is not only communication to get things done but also communication related to the decision-making process.</p>
<p>So, it will be interesting to experiment discussions around different time-zones and locations. I will probably post more about the assembly and the planning for the Summit in the next days, when ideas and thoughts will have settled down a bit and I’ll have had the time to read all the ideas and documentation we produced during this two days. What I felt important to communicate immediately is the fact that the next Summit will be a wonderful occasion to talk not only about our technologies but also about who we are, what we want to do and where we want to go. It will be an occasion for the community to teach and mentor the newest community members and more importantly all the new employees to let them understand and feel the power and importance of our community and it will be, in general, an occasion to have our voice finally be heard and taken into consideration not only in the tasks at hand, but in building the new policies and guidelines that will drive all the project in the future.</p>
<p>I’m sure we’ll try, in the next months, to provide some initial information and documentation about what have been discussed and decided so far so that you can arrive at the Summit prepared to give your contribution to the conversation, so that we can take the most out of the Summit and make it really matter in our future.</p>
<p>As I said at the beginning: if we manage to discuss and propose solutions to half of the problems and concerns raised during this two days, we will have had the best Mozilla event ever; one that will have strengthened and made our project more mature.</p>" nil nil "93b854b21a946eca76cd509409195d8c") (68 (20928 8795 843215) "http://aaronmt.github.com/blog/2013/06/17/webrtc-testday" "Aaron Train: Discover and Help Test WebRTC in Firefox for Android and Firefox on Desktop on Friday June 21st, 2013" nil "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 07:00:00 +0000" "<p>This upcoming Friday, we would love for you to solicit your support towards testing and contributing to the process of qualifying a new developer-release version of Firefox for Android and Firefox on Desktop both on the <a href=\"http://nightly.mozilla.org\">Nightly</a> channel as part of our rapid release testing cycle. We will be focusing on the process of discovering, using and testing <a href=\"http://www.webrtc.org/\">WebRTC</a>.</p>
<p>WebRTC is a free, open project that enables web browsers with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple Javascript APIs. The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose. The WebRTC mission is to enable rich, high quality, RTC applications to be developed in the browser via simple Javascript APIs and HTML5. The WebRTC initiative is a project supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera.</p>
<p>This QA event, this Friday, is open to <strong>all</strong> those interested: newcomers, experienced testers, developers, and anyone interested in testing early builds of Firefox on the Nightly channel.</p>
<p>We would like for you to use the new version of Firefox on your Android phone and desktop or laptop machine, and take a close look at the latest Nightly builds in order to assist us in identifying any noticeably major issues found with our <a href=\"http://www.webrtc.org/\">WebRTC</a> implementation, and ensure that all feature functionality that is included in this upcoming release is on its way to a feature and testing complete state.</p>
<p>To cover the work throughout the whole day we have created an <a href=\"https://etherpad.mozilla.org/testday-20130621-webrtc\">EtherPad</a> test-plan. Please feel free to read and use it as a companion during the day’s event. There will be moderators at hand in the IRC channel: <a href=\"http://goo.gl/1c6h7\">#testday</a>, to answer any questions you have.</p>
<p>Together with your help we want to make this event a success and ensure the high quality of WebRTC support in Firefox for all of our users world-wide. If you have time on Friday June 21st, 2013, please join us on IRC, we will have Mozilla community and testers on hand to help answer any of your questions.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://codepo8.github.io/canvas-masking/\"><img alt=\"masks\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3509\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/masks.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>
<p>All you need to do is add the canvasmask.js script and add a class of mask to each image you want to mask. You also need to provide a <span class=\"caps\">PNG</span> file as the mask using the data-mask attribute. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><div class=\"wp_syntax\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre class=\"xml\" style=\"font-family: monospace;\"><span style=\"color: #009900;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\"><img</span> <span style=\"color: #000066;\">src</span>=<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\"red-panda.jpg\"</span> </span>
<span style=\"color: #009900;\">     <span style=\"color: #000066;\">alt</span>=<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\"Red panda\"</span> </span>
<span style=\"color: #009900;\">     <span style=\"color: #000066;\">class</span>=<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\"mask\"</span> </span>
<span style=\"color: #009900;\">     <span style=\"color: #000066;\">data-mask</span>=<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\"centerblur.png\"</span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">></span></span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p></p>
<p>This will take the centerblur.png file and apply it as a mask to red-panda.jpg – in effect taking the alpha of each pixel and change the alpha of the original pixel to that.</p>
<p>You can <a href=\"http://codepo8.github.io/canvas-masking/\">see it in action here</a> and <a href=\"http://github.com/codepo8/canvas-masking/\">get the code on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><del>Under the hood, all I do is loop through all the pixels of the images (after copying them to two canvas elements) and apply the alpha values (every 4th value in the pixeldata array) of the <span class=\"caps\">PNG</span> to the image. Simple, really :)</del></p>
<p><ins>As mentioned by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/345836125132320768\">Jake Archibald on Twitter</a> there is no need to loop over the pixels of the images, all you need is to copy the mask first, then change the canvas compositing to source-atop and add the image. Done. The script does that now, and thus is much faster.</ins></p>

Why? Most of my add-ons do something in the background at the user's request, and when it's done, the user wants to know. Alternatively, if my add-on attempts to do something and fails, the user would see nothing happen at all, unless I somehow tell them.</p>
<p>In real life, this is supposed to look something like this example, from <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-url-252534/\">\"Copy URL\"</a>:</p>
<p><img alt=\"Copy URL notification\" src=\"http://fredericiana.com/media/2013/copy-url-notification.jpg\" /></p>
<p>The Mozilla Add-ons SDK even has a <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/modules/sdk/notifications.html\">convenient API</a> for it. Easy, right?</p>
<p>Sadly, not so fast: While the SDK is supposed to abstract all of this neatly away from me and \"just work\" on Linux, Windows, and OS X, the behavior is inconsistent, owed -- on OS X, anyway -- to the wonky state of notification support on the operating system level.</p>
<h3>To Growl or not to Growl</h3>
<p>I've ran into issues with notifications repeatedly over time, and employed a number of solutions so far. <em>Spoiler alert:</em> I am happy with none of them.</p>
<p>OS X 10.7 and below relied on a third-party tool called <a href=\"http://growl.info/\">Growl</a> to support notifications. If you had it installed, the SDK's API would work just great. Sadly, if you <em>didn't</em> have it installed, notifications would <strong>silently be swallowed</strong>. Worse yet, I was unable to detect if this happened, so I had no way to implement a fallback mechanism.</p>
<p>The OS X 10.8 \"notification center\" was supposed to fix this, but <a href=\"http://canuckistani.ca/blog/2012/10/28/10-dot-8-notification-center-sucks/\">apparently</a>, it will only display our notifications if the browser does <strong>not</strong> have the focus. In other words, it's completely useless for in-context notifications.</p>
<p>I considered all that a very poor user experience and instead of using the SDK's API, I implemented my own notifications module called <a href=\"https://github.com/fwenzel/copy-shorturl/blob/a6ed22d/lib/simple-notify.js\">\"simple-notify\"</a> that would detect the availability of the notifications service (i.e., Growl or any other platform-specific service) first, and if none was found would employ a fallback mechanism.</p>
<h3>The ugly but reliable notifications bar</h3>
<p>The fallback mechanism I use is the once-ubiquitous, gray, Firefox notification bar:</p>
<p><img alt=\"Copy ShortURL notification bar\" src=\"http://fredericiana.com/media/2013/copy-shorturl-notification-bar.jpg\" /></p>
<p>It is shown in context, grabs the user's attention (perhaps a little too much) <em>and</em>, most importantly, <strong>it is reliably available on all platforms</strong>.</p>
<p>This notification bar has its downsides: For example, it's fairly intrusive and not easily ignored. My add-ons usually auto-close it after a few seconds. If I didn't do that, the bar would persist until closed by the user. This solution also can't handle more than one notification at a time: A second notification will overlay the previous one.</p>
<h3>HTML5 Notifications API</h3>
<p>Luckily, there's hope. The <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/\">W3C Notifications API</a> landed <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/04/hidpi-support-html5-notifications-parallel-js-asm-js-and-more-firefox-development-highlights/\">in Firefox 22</a>, which (at the time of writing) is the next upcoming release version. If the Add-ons SDK is updated to use this API, this should finally allow me to use one line of code for notifications, not a few dozen.</p>
<p>In the context of a page, I can even use it already (without Add-ons SDK support), with two caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>To remain backwards compatible (for a while, anyway) I'd still have to implement a fallback mechanism. Once Firefox 22 is the current release version, however, I could relax that rule and just live with the fact that users of previous versions may or may not receive notifications.</li>
<li>The W3C standard (rightly) requires to ask for permission before a website can issue notifications. Add-ons should be able to use notifications without explicit permission step.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm looking forward to the time when all this will smoothly work as expected!</p>

background showing up, and the bugs overlayed on top of it, but as it stands,
I’m requiring the designers to draw the lines connecting the bugs to the various
areas in the mockup right on the mockup itself!  This is obviously a fairly
terrible idea, since it makes it much harder than it should to move stuff around
after the fact, and requires a ton of up-front planning when creating the
initial image.  But what are my other options?</p>
<p>I thought for a while about layering a canvas element over the mockup; it would
let me draw whatever shapes I wanted to, but passing the click events through to
the mockup seemed like it would be fairly annoying, and I don’t think the
connecting lines should appear in front of the boxes showing the bug details,
which adds another wrinkle.  Then, over lunch, I started to wonder what it would
look like if a <a href=\"https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/blob/feature/angular/public/images/black-line.png\">1px by 1px black square</a> got stretched and rotated with CSS…  So I took some time after lunch, and played around a
little, and it seems like it just might work!  <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/aBjp7/3/\">Give it a try</a>, let me know if you have any ideas to make it

<h3>The Old Big Ticket Items List</h3>
<h4>#5: Better Script Handling</h4>
<p>This had two parts.  The first part was the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=679942\">sharing of immutable parts of scripts</a>, which Till Schneidereit implemented.  It can save multiple MiBs of memory, particular if you have numerous tabs open from the same website.</p>
<p>The second part is <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678037\">lazy bytecode generation</a>, which Brian Hackett has implemented and landed, though it hasn’t yet enabled.  Brian is working out the remaining kinks and hopes to land by the end of the current (v24) cycle.    Hopefully he will, because measurements have shown that it can reduce Firefox’s memory consumption by 5% or more on common workloads!  That’s a huge, general improvement.  Furthermore, it significantly reduces the number of things that are allocated on the GC heap (i.e. scripts, strings, objects and shapes that are created when bytecode for a function is generated).  This reduces pressure on the GC which makes it less likely we’ll have bad GC behaviour (e.g. pauses, or too much memory consumption) in cases where the GC heuristics aren’t optimal.</p>
<p>So the first part is done and the second is imminent, which is enough to cross this item off the list.  [Update:  Brian <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678037#c93\">just enabled lazy bytecode on trunk</a>!]</p>
<h4>#4: Regain compartment-per-global losses</h4>
<p>Bill McCloskey implemented <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=759585\">zones</a>, which restructured the heap to allow a certain amount of sharing between zones. This greatly reduced wasted space and reduced memory consumption in common cases by ~5%.</p>
<p>Some more could still be done for this issue.  In particular, it’s not clear if things have improved enough that many small JSMs can be used without wasting memory.  Nonetheless, things have improved enough that I’m happy to take this item off the list.</p>
<h4>#3: Boot2Gecko</h4>
<p>This item was about getting about:memory (or something similar) working on B2G, and using it to optimize memory.  This was done some time ago and the memory reporters (plus DMD) were enormously helpful in improving memory consumption.  Many of the fixes fell under the umbrella of <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=797189\">Operation Slim Fast</a>.</p>
<p>So I will remove this particular item from the list, but memory optimizations for B2G are far from over, as we’ll see below.</p>
<h4>#2: Compacting Generational GC</h4>
<p>See below.</p>
<h4>#1: Better Foreground Tab Image Handling</h4>
<p>See below.</p>
<h3>The New Big Ticket Items List</h3>
<h4>#5: pdf.js</h4>
<p>pdf.js was recently made the default way of opening PDFs in Firefox, replacing plug-ins such as Adobe Reader.  While this is great in a number of respects, such as security, it’s not as good for memory consumption, because <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881974\">pdf.js can use a lot of memory</a> in at least some cases.  We need to investigate the known cases and improve things.</p>
<h4>#4: Dev tools</h4>
<p>While we’ve made great progress with memory profiling tools that help Firefox developers, the situation is not nearly as good for web developers.  Google Chrome has heap profiling tools for web developers, and Firefox should too.  (The design space for heap profilers is quite large and so Firefox shouldn’t just copy Chrome’s tools.)  Alexandre Poirot has started work on a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=863228\">promising prototype</a>, though there is a lot of work remaining before any such prototype can make it into a release.</p>
<h4>#3: B2G Nuwa</h4>
<p>Cervantes Yu and Thinker Li have been working on <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=771765\">Nuwa</a>, which aims to give B2G a pre-initialized template process from which every subsequent process will be forked.  This might sound esoteric, but the important part is that it greatly increases the ability for B2G processes to share unchanging data.  In <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=771765#c29\">one test run</a>, this increased the number of apps that could be run simultaneously from five to <em>nine</em>, which is obviously a big deal.  The downside is that getting it to work requires some extremely hairy fiddling with low-level code.  Fingers crossed it can be made to work reliably!</p>
<p>Beyond Nuwa, there is still plenty of other ways that B2G can have its memory consumption optimized, as you’d expect in an immature mobile OS.  Although I won’t list anything else in the big ticket items list, work will continue here, as per <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/MemShrink\">MemShrink’s primary aim:</a> “MemShrink is a project that aims to reduce the memory consumption of Firefox (on desktop and mobile) and Firefox OS.”</p>
<h4>#2: Compacting Generational GC</h4>
<p>Generational GC will reduce fragmentation, reduce the working set size, and speed up collections.  Great progress has been made here — the enormous task of <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=753203\">exactly rooting</a> the JS engine and the browser is basically finished, helped along greatly by a static analysis implemented by Brian Hackett.  And Terrence Cole and others are well into converting the collector to be generational.  So we’re a lot closer than we were, but there is still some way to go.  So this item is steady at #2.</p>
<h4>#1: Better Foreground Tab Image Handling</h4>
<p>Firefox still uses much more memory than other browsers on image-heavy pages.  Fortunately, a great deal of progress has been made here.  Timothy Nikkel <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=689623\">fixed things</a> so that memory usage when scrolling through image-heavy pages is greatly reduced.  However, this change caused some <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=845147\">jank on pages with lots of small images</a>, so it’s currently disabled on the non-trunk branches.  Also, there is still a memory spike when <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=847223\">memory-heavy pages are first loaded</a>, which needs to be fixed before this item can be considered done.  So this item remains at #1.</p>

This has some benefits; in particular it can be quite efficient, since coordination costs are low. It's also a good way to reduce the amount of code learning developers have to do. Another approach is to put N people to work on one large project, and hopefully get it done in roughly 1/N of the time. I think the latter is probably a better way to work. I think we get better reviews, since at least for me, I do much better reviews in code I've actually hacked on than in code I've never touched. It means that if someone gets hit by a bus --- or worse still, leaves Mozilla --- we've got people who we know can work on the code. Projects getting completed faster means there's less bitrot to deal with. It makes us more agile (I hate that word though). Perhaps most importantly, it's more fun. </p><p>Most of our projects go through a startup/prototyping phase where we write some new code and get things basically working. Then there's a grind phase where we get the code working on all platforms, iron out the corner cases, fix all the regressions, fix all the fuzz bugs, write tests, and get it landed. The latter phase is usually a lot more work than the startup phase, but it's also the phase that parallelizes across developers fairly easily. So I think we should consciously try to work this way: when a project enters the grind phase, we should shift developers onto it until it's over the line. We've done some of this recently with fixing rooting hazards in JS, and in the layers refactoring. </p><p>In cases like OMTC there's some flexibility since getting the project \"over the line\" isn't all-or-nothing. Having people individually bring up platforms one-by-one works OK and brings incremental benefits. Same goes for converting code from XPIDL to WebIDL. So for those, the benefit of having a lot of people pile on is reduced (especially, in a conversion project, if we know that for some reason or another we will never be able to completely eliminate the stuff we're converting from). </p><p>In any case, I hope that from now on, for any project of significant size we have at least two people working on it during the grind phase, to capture the benefits I mentioned above.

<p>Previously, if you called <code>do_check_null(null)</code>, you would get an output that was similar to:</p>

<p>This isn’t very helpful, and I ran into this exact issue while working on some code that uses observers. Since the data is passed as JSON, when <code>JSON.stringify(null)</code> is called the result is “null”.

<p>With this recent change, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=880568\">all string arguments will be adorned with double-quotes</a>.</p>
<p>This means that calling <code>do_check_null(\"null\")</code> will now output:<br />
<code><br />
[TEST-FAIL] \"null\" == null</code></p>
<p>The same change was made for all of the other <code>do_check_*</code> and <code>do_print</code> macros.</p>

Now Firefox recognize a \"key\" ARIA role which is mapped to push button role on IAccessible2/ATK layer. It is supposed to be used for on-screen keyboards and dialpads. AT can use  <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">xml-roles</span></span> object attribute to pick up that role.<br /><br /><h3>HTML</h3><br />* A major change of this release is we don't longer create a flat hierarchy for HTML selects (see <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=809338\">bug</a>). Say you have a HTML <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">select</span></span> having <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">optgroup</span></span> elements like<br /><br />  <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><select></span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">    <option>item</span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">    <optgroup label=\"group\"></span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">      <option>subitem</span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">    </optgroup></span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">  </select> </span></span><br /><br />then we used to have an accessible hierarchy like:<br /><br />  <span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span>combobox - HTML select</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span>   option - HTML option (item)</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span>   heading - HTML optgroup</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span>   option- HTML option (subitem)</span></span><br /><br />Firefox 23 exposes the following hierarchy:<br /><br />  <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">combobox</span></span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span> - HTML select</span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">   option</span></span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span> - HTML option (item)</span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">   grouping </span></span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span>- HTML optgroup</span></span><br /><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">     option </span></span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span>- HTML option (subitem)</span></span><br /><br /><br />* Another change is HTML5 <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">input@type=range</span></span> <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=559764\">is now accessible</a>. It's exposed as a slider role and implements the value interface, i.e. you can obtain min, max and current values and step. Also it fires value change events.<br /><br /><h3>Nasty bugs</h3><br />A bug where JAWS lost the virtual buffer <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=866495\">was fixed</a>. The patch was back ported to Firefox 22 and Firefox 21.<br /><br />Another bug was that we lost inactive document occasionally. So if the user didn't interact with the document and the document wasn't self updated via JavaScript then it could be not accessible for screen readers (see <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=862863\">bug</a>).<br /><br /><h3>ISimpleDOM support</h3><br />Yet another ISimpleDOM interface (<span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">ISimpleDOMText</span></span>) was <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=865588\">tear offed</a> as continuation of <a href=\"http://asurkov.blogspot.ru/2012/12/isimpledom-support.html\">this work</a>.<br /><br /><h3>Other bug fixes</h3><br />* A selection bug where we wrongly claimed that unfocused text area has a selection <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=440590\">was fixed</a>.<br /><br />* We  don't prune children anymore for number of roles like text entry, menu  items and etc if they have complex trees.  In other words, if for example a text entry has anything else than a plain text  then you will see that in hierarchy (see <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=865997\">bug</a>). So if you do<br /><br />  <span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><div role=\"textbox\"><span role=\"button\"></span></div></span></span><br /><br />then you will get a button inside the text entry.</div>" nil nil "591c7f1cf00ca0e5fd1cec7d7994c0d5") (54 (20928 8795 829052) "http://www.peterbe.com/plog/in-python-you-sort-with-a-tuple" "Peter Bengtsson: In Python you sort with a tuple" nil "Fri, 14 Jun 2013 01:34:53 +0000" "<p>My colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/axelhecht\">Axel Hecht</a> showed me something I didn't know about sorting in Python.<br />
</p>
<p>In Python you can sort with a tuple. It's best illustrated with a simple example:<br />
</p>
<div class=\"highlight\">
<pre><span class=\"o\">>>></span> <span class=\"n\">items</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'B'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'A'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'A'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'B'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'a'</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span>
<span class=\"o\">>>></span> <span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">items</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>
<span class=\"p\">[(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'B'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'a'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'A'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'B'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'A'</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>By default the <code>sort</code> and the <code>sorted</code> built-in function notices that the items are tuples so it sorts on the first element first and on the second element second.<br />
</p>
<p>However, notice how you get <code>(0, 'B')</code> appearing before <code>(0, 'a')</code>. That's because upper case comes before lower case characters. However, suppose you wanted to apply some \"humanization\" on that and sort case insensitively. You might try:<br />
</p>
<div class=\"highlight\">
<pre><span class=\"o\">>>></span> <span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">items</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">key</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lower</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>
<span class=\"n\">Traceback</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">most</span> <span class=\"n\">recent</span> <span class=\"n\">call</span> <span class=\"n\">last</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>
<span class=\"n\">File</span> <span class=\"s\">\"<stdin>\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">line</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"o\"><</span><span class=\"n\">module</span><span class=\"o\">></span>

</pre></div>
<p>which is an error we deserve because this won't work for the first part of each tuple.<br />
</p>
<p>We could try to write a lambda function (e.g. <code>sorted(items, key=lambda x: x.lower() if isinstance(x, str) else x)</code>) but that's not going to work because you'll only ever get to apply that to the first item.<br />
</p>
<p>Without further ado, here's how you do it. A lambda function that returns a tuple:<br />
</p>
<div class=\"highlight\">
<pre><span class=\"o\">>>></span> <span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">items</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">key</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">lambda</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lower</span><span class=\"p\">()))</span>
<span class=\"p\">[(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'a'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'B'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'A'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'B'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'A'</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And there you have it! Thanks for sharing Axel!<br />
</p>
<p>As a bonus item for people still reading...<br />
I'm sure you know that you can reverse a sort order simply by passing in <code>sorted(items, reverse=True, ...)</code> but what if you want to have different directions depend on the key that you're sorting on.<br />
</p>
<p>Using the technique of a lambda function that returns a tuple, here's how we sort a slightly more advanced structure:<br />
</p>
<div class=\"highlight\">
<pre><span class=\"o\">>>></span> <span class=\"n\">peeps</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[{</span><span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'Bill'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'Bill'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">500</span><span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'Ted'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">500</span><span class=\"p\">}]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And now, sort with a lambda function returning a tuple:<br />
</p>
<div class=\"highlight\">
<pre><span class=\"o\">>>></span> <span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">peeps</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">key</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">lambda</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">]))</span>
<span class=\"p\">[{</span><span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">500</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'Bill'</span><span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'Bill'</span><span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'salary'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">500</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'name'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'Ted'</span><span class=\"p\">}]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Makes sense, right? <code>Bill</code> comes before <code>Ted</code> and 500 comes before 1000. But how do you sort it like that on the name <em>but reverse on the salary</em>? Simple, negate it:<br />
</p>
<div class=\"highlight\">

</li><li>To find out what your lycamobile phone number is, dial “*#122#”
</li><li>Assuming that all works, you should now attempt to call any local number. By habit, I call the mobile phone of the person at the store selling me the SIM card.

</li><li>Now that you can make/receive calls, to make my Android 2.2 phone transmit/receive data, I had to add the following APN settings:<br />

* go into “wireless & network settings”<br />
* go into “mobile networks”<br />
* go into “access point names”<br />

</li><li>verify that this new “data.lycamobile.pt” APK is present, and is selected.
</li><li>verify that “Use only 2G networks” is not selected.
</li><li>Reboot the phone to see if that helps.
</li><li>At this point you should be able to make/receive calls, send/receive text messages, surf the web, use your cellphone as GPS, and use your cellphone as a wifi hotspot.

<a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/users/ahalberstadt_mozilla.com/qqver/\">qqver</a> is a Mercurial extension that forces mq
to version all patch queues in the same repository. The syntax is the exact same as when doing normal patch queue
versioning (i.e 'hg init --mq'), except the repo is created one directory higher so it is able to track all patch
queues. As with stock queue repos, new and existing patches are added automatically.
</p>
<p>
qqver solves a very specific use case, it probably isn't useful for the majority of Mercurial users. If you answer yes
to both of the following questions, you might want to look into qqver:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you like to work with multiple patch queues in a single repository (i.e using hg qq)?</li>
<li>Do you like to version your patch queues with mq's patch versioning system (i.e using the --mq flag)?</li>
</ol>
<p>
Versioning all patch queues in the same repo makes it a lot easier to create and manage remote repos, e.g on an hg.m.o <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Creating_Mercurial_User_Repositories#Mercurial_Queue_User_Repository_Workflow\">user repository</a>. Instead of having to create N user repositories for N patch queues, you only need to create one.
</p>
<p>
qqver works by monkeypatching the mq extension in an unobtrusive way. This gives it some nice
properties. First, the syntax is the exact same as what you are already used to:
</p>
<pre># create queue repo and push remote
hg init --mq
hg commit --mq
hg push --mq
</pre>
<p>
Another nice property is that it is fully compatible with Steve Fink's <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/sfink/mqext\">mqext</a>
extension. This means if you want to autocommit your patch queue anytime you make a change, you can easily do so by
configuring mqext. One thing I'd still like to implement, is to monkeypatch mqext so it adds the current patch queue to the commit
messages (in addition to the patch name).
</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<pre>hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/users/ahalberstadt_mozilla.com/qqver/
</pre>
<p>
Then edit your ~/.hgrc file and add:
</p>
<pre>[extensions]
mq=
qqver=<path/to/qqver>
</pre>
<p>
Note that the mq extension needs to be installed, otherwise qqver makes no sense! Also note that this is still fairly untested,
so please let me know of any problems you encounter or features you'd like implemented. Or feel free to send me a patch ;).

They provide a nice way to show an alternative or a secondary context in an activity. <code><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ShareActionProvider.html\">ShareActionProvider</a></code> takes them to another level. The secondary context of showing a list of shareable activities is available as a menu item. In addition, they show the most frequently used Activity for quick sharing. But they come with a downside. As the name says, ActionProviders can only be present in an ActionBar. Most of the popular android apps don’t use an ActionBar as it is very limiting. Firefox for Android has the same problem, as it doesn’t use an ActionBar. How do we provide the user with such a fast and easy access to the most frequently used activity?</p>
<p>Since Firefox for Android uses a custom menu, adding an ActionProvider logic inside a ListView was easy. Analogous to the ShareActionProvider, the main menu item gives the list of shareable activities as a <code>SubMenu</code>, and the most frequently used app is shown along with the actual menu item. To use the same metrics as Android for the frequency calculation, we chose to use the same underlying model. Android’s implementation of storing and receiving applications from an XML file, ordering the applications based on a time based weight is available in <code><a href=\"https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/android/widget/ActivityChooserModel.java\">ActivityChooserModel</a></code>. (Note: When used, one would have to copy this file to their code base, as this file is an internal file).</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_315\" style=\"width: 235px;\"><a href=\"http://sriramramani.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/share-quickly/quick-share/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-315\"><img alt=\"Share menu item with the more frequently used application for sharing quickly.\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-315\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://sriramramani.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/quick-share.png?w=225&h=400\" width=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Share menu item with the more frequently used application for sharing quickly.</p></div>
<p>While working on this feature, I was left with so many puzzling discoveries!</p>
<ul>
<li>While setting an Intent with ShareActionProvider for the first time, it calls ActivityChooserModel’s setIntent(). This triggers reading the list from the history file by calling <code><a href=\"https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/android/widget/ActivityChooserModel.java#L975\">readHistoricalDataImpl</a>()</code>. The problem here is that, even though the comment — oops, just a comment! — says everything is done off the UI thread, the reading of a file from the disk and parsing it happens in the UI thread. This causes StrictModeViolation, and hogs the UI.</li>
<li>ShareActionProvider’s <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ShareActionProvider.html#setShareIntent%28android.content.Intent%29\">setShareIntent()</a> should be used sparsely. Though one of the Android articles touches this, the reason is not explained. Let’s say the application is a photo sharing application and it needs to update the image date when the user flips through the gallery. Calling <code>setShareIntent()</code> sounds the easiest way. However, setShareIntent() rebuilds the list every single time. And, as I mentioned earlier, setShareIntent() runs on the UI thread. This would result in UI jankiness. Instead, it’s better to store the Intent that was given to the ShareActionProvider, and update the <code>EXTRA</code> parameters in it, leaving the <code>ACTION</code> and MIME type intact. This way, the intent remains the same, and the data varies, without doing any work on the UI thread. But hey, there is not getter for this method! So, it’s our responsibility to store it in our class.</li>
<li>Even getters in this file wants to ensure a consistent state. In case something had changed with the list of activities, either it loads them all once again, or reads from the disk. Which thread will this run on? Clicking on the Share icon, would ask the ActionProvider to get a list of activities. The event handling runs on the UI thread. This in turn ensures a consistent state and returns the items back on the UI thread. So, every setter or getter will (usually) be run on the UI thread and could cause considerable work to be done on the main thread.</li>
<li>Lets say, some other application wants to expose Share with a custom ActionProvider like Firefox for Android. When they try to use the ActivityChooserModel, there is a reference to <code><a href=\"https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/com/android/internal/content/PackageMonitor.java\">PackageMonitor</a></code>. Unfortunately this file is internal and has a lot of other internal dependencies. Commenting the related code will leave the history file, and the list in a stale state if some other shareable app is installed/uninstalled while this app is in the background.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phew! Basically ShareActionProvider is some sort of a UI hog, if not used correctly. ActionProviders cannot be used outside of ActionBar, even though they provide a nice paradigm. Why Android, why?</p>

interpose facilities for SPS. This feature will allow main thread I/O to be
displayed in the profiler UI.</p>
<p>There are a few components to this patch. Classes that implement the
<code>IOInterposerModule</code> interface are responsible for hooking into an arbitrary I/O
facility and calling into <code>IOInterposer</code> with those events.</p>
<p>The <code>IOInterposer</code> receives those events and then dispatches them to any registered
observers. For the purposes of SPS there is only one observer,
<code>ProfilerIOInterposeObserver</code>, however I wrote this keeping in mind that we
may eventually want to use the I/O interpose facilities for other purposes (such
as shutdown write poisioning).</p>
<p>For bug 867762 I have implemented two modules. <code>NSPRInterposer</code> hooks into NSPR
file I/O and generates events whenever a <code>PR_Read</code>, <code>PR_Write</code>, or <code>PR_Sync</code> occurs.
The second module, <code>SQLiteInterposer</code>, leverages the SQLite VFS that we use for
telemetry to tap into reads, writes, and fsyncs generated by SQLite. In the future
we expect to expand this into several additional modules. Some ideas include a module
that uses Event Tracing for Windows to read events from the Windows kernel and a
module that interposes calls to <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>fsync</code> on Linux.</p>
<p>On the observer side of things, for now we simply insert a marker into the profiler
timeline whenever main thread I/O is reported. Here is a sample screenshot of the
markers in action (the pink stuff for readers who are unfamiliar with SPS markers):</p>
<p><a href=\"http://dblohm7.ca/images/iomarkers.png\"><img src=\"http://dblohm7.ca/images/iomarkers.png\" /></a></p>
<p>In <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=867757\">bug 867757</a> (under review)
this will become more sophisticated, as SPS will immediately sample the callstack of
the thread whose I/O has been intercepted. This annotated stack will be inserted
directly into the timeline.</p>
<p>There will need to be some UI changes for this to be presented in a reasonable way,
but with both existing patches applied the data is already useful. By firing up
Cleopatra and filtering on either <code>NSPRInterposer</code> or <code>SQLiteInterposer</code>, you can
isolate and view the main thread I/O stacks:</p>

This is inexcusable given that my meeting load is actually very light. </p><p>I have identified a few contributing factors. Many of these meetings are outside normal work hours (especially early in the morning, given my timezone), so sometimes I fail to check my calendar before I go to bed and wake up after the meeting. Sometimes I want to wake up but forget to set my alarm, or set it incorrectly. Sometimes the alarm just fails to wake me up. Sometimes I know about the meeting and I'm awake and working, but I get caught up in something and don't realize that the time has arrived. I use Google Calendar and GMail, and when people send time change notification emails Google Calendar adds them as new meetings instead of replacing the existing one, which sometimes confuses me about when the meeting is. I quite often quit and restart my browser, which means my Google Calendar tab often isn't really loaded and can't produce notifications. Most of my meetings are teleconferences of some kind, and sometimes I don't plan ahead and when I try to join the meeting, I find that Vidyo isn't working or some other technical problem prevents me from joining the meeting immediately.  None of these issues are excuses, since this isn't a very hard problem. </p><p>I could try setting up the FxOS calendar app, but I'm not very vigilant about keeping my phone charged so that might not help much. Maybe I should do that and also ensure that I have a desktop calendar app capable of producing audible notifications, that launches on startup. To some extent I may just have to be trained by pain and humiliation. </p><p>Until that happens, consider this blog post an apology for the meetings I've missed, and an apology in advance for the meetings I miss in the future.

The extent of this assistance is a topic of debate. What’s clear, though, is that the process itself is opaque: it’s impossible to know how broad or inappropriate the surveillance may be.</p>
<p>OK, so what do we do about it?</p>
<h4>told you so, never shoulda trusted the Cloud</h4>
<p>Some folks see this as vindication: we never should have trusted the Cloud. Only trust yourself, generate your own keypairs, encrypt all traffic, host your own email, etc. Servers are evil and should be considered leaky stupid passthroughs for fully encrypted data.</p>
<p>First, this is naive. If government agencies believe they have the authority to monitor all Internet traffic, would they hesitate to create viruses that infect and monitor endpoints? Would they hesitate to force software and hardware vendors to build secret backdoors into their products? It is the engineer’s mistake to believe that Law Enforcement will stop cleanly at technical abstraction layers. If the goal is total surveillance, the financial means immense, the arm-twisting strength unlimited, the oversight inexistent.. what would you do in their position?</p>
<p>Second, if, like me, you agree that technology experts have a duty to build solutions that matter to laypeople, it’s also irresponsible. None of these paranoid solutions are accessible to laypeople. Can you imagine Grandpa with his fingerprint-activated USB-key holding his RSA-2048-bit secret key and surfing the Web via Tor proclaiming “not me, I will fight the man!” Yeah. (And if you’re thinking “no Grandpa, not RSA! Elliptic curves!” well, thank you for making my point for me.)</p>
<p>So enough with this la-la land of users as fortified islands communicating via torpedo-proof-ciphertext-carrying submarines. <em>People engage with others by way of intermediaries they trust, for that is the basis of all human interaction and commerce since the dawn of time.</em> Let us build systems, both technical and legal, that start there.</p>
<h4>protect user data wherever it lives</h4>
<p>We can build systems that start with <em>respect for the user and her data, wherever it lives</em>. On Facebook servers, on Google servers, on self-hosted servers, on private computers. Encrypted or not encrypted. We can and should use cryptography to secure channels from those who would disrespect user data, reduce data collection to that which is useful, and generally build defense in depth against bad actors. We should stop wasting time on systems that impose the resulting complexity on users. Government access to user data should follow a clear, transparent process that is consistent wherever the data happens to be stored, however it happens to be encrypted.</p>
<p>Let’s build that system together. Not by barricading ourselves on our lonely islands of encryption and onion-routing. But by building <em>the legal and technical framework we need to respect users and their data</em>. <a href=\"https://optin.stopwatching.us/\">Mozilla</a> and <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/asking-us-government-to-allow-google-to.html\">Google</a> have started.

There are other articles out there that speak to what I’m about to say, but hey, I want to talk too and this is my article. Many voices.</p>
<p>As a designer, what an age we live in. People everywhere are coming online within social networks, blogs and other sites sharing ideas and inspiring the masses with a collective outpouring of creativity. As a designer, it is amazing to have the ability to play and be inspired by thousands upon thousands of my peers just by simply seeing their work tweeted or shared in a portfolio site online. What an awesome resource the Internet is for creativity and anyone first stepping into the design world.</p>
<p>As a designer, it is also terrifying.</p>
<p>Why would any designer out there want to become high enough profile in their profession that thousands or millions of people get to see their work? How badly would that person have to hate themselves to put up with the onslaught of feedback that can be defined simply as deconstructive? Maybe someone might think they ripped off another designer and their career would be over before it even started. Do they even have any original ideas or are they just interpretations of what others have already done? What if everyone hates their work? Wait… who is “everyone”?</p>
<p>I know, right? Frig that. I’m just going to stare at this wall for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Imposter syndrome is something lots of us are talking about these days. It leads to fear in one’s abilities, fear in being excited about your work, fear in the impact your work may have, fear in the lack of impact… self doubt is a huge gronk of a beast as a designer. So when I see current events like the deluge of hate towards the iOS 7 redesign or someone ripping apart #the #latest #design #story, I can’t help but think that all this deconstructive criticism and rage is simply unfiltered bullying. What else is it? Are these haters doing anything to offer guidance or help with any of the concerns they may have? No. Are these people at the very top of their field in design that they now know the One True Way to design a product, brand or piece of art? Mostly no, but sadly sometimes they are damn close and should know better. Do these haters actually care that there are individuals behind these designs and not just faceless companies? Again, in most cases, probably not.</p>
<p>Here’s something I learned over the years. The haters are the minority. They shout to be heard and unfortunately the haters sometimes become the majority in numbers within the feedback you do get. That is only because everyone else is just enjoying your work, or respects it enough to not offer criticism without purpose. If they over-the-moon love it, they’ll comment. If they want to offer constructive advice, they’ll comment. </p>
<p>So as a designer, what can you do?</p>
<p>Lead. Lead by example. Learn to love the helpers and ignore the haters. Inspire others, don’t belittle them. Be constructive, not destructive. Embrace fear. Allow the challenge of taming that fear to lead you to that amazing creative spark that everyone sees shining through the final piece. Love what you do, regardless of what others say. If you love your work, it shows. Don’t be afraid to show it off, but remain humble – allow some of that imposter syndrome to keep you in check so you’re not seen as a diva.</p>
<p>If you’re just beginning as a designer, be it through school or just as a side experience, welcome! Embrace any fears you may have because for the most part they stick around the whole way through your career. Love them and they’ll keep you humble and a designer others want to work with. You’ll find your place.</p>
<p>If you’re a designer now, I salute you. Keep all of this in mind and be sure to inspire, nurture, mentor, aid, encourage, all other designers. We’re not competition. We’re family. Don’t let a paycheque make you a hater.</p>
<p>As a designer, don’t be a bully. Just play.</p>" nil nil "18d894eac081976952d345f521107d68") (38 (20928 8795 696686) "http://home.kairo.at/blog/2013-06/linguistically_mistaking_phrases" "Robert Kaiser: Linguistically Mistaking Phrases" "KaiRo" "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 15:41:36 +0000" "I've been back from my vacation and the <a href=\"http://home.kairo.at/blog/2013-05/preserving_software_feedback_requested\">Preserving Software</a> summit at the Library of Congress for more than a week now, but still haven't blogged about anything, and I recently didn't blog too much at all, mostly because I always fear it takes up too much time. In the last few days, I decided I'll do shorter posts but do them more often, so I hopefully get to communicate more of what's going around in my head (thoughts on that summit will follow as well when I get around to them). Here's the first installment of this, let's see how it goes.<br />
<br />
I just listened to a <a href=\"https://air.mozilla.org/fireside-chat-3/\">\"Fireside Chat\"</a> (sorry, only available to Mozillians) with <a href=\"https://brendaneich.com/\">Brendan Eich</a>, conducted by <a href=\"http://blog.finette.com/\">Pascal Finette</a>. One thing that did strike me there was the use of two phrases, by each of them, and their chances of being mistaken from the point of view of English/German crossover.<br />
<br />
Pascal, a native German (his accent gives that away as well), is using \"a couple\" (e.g. \"of times\", etc.) in many questions in this interview. Now, the interesting thing there is that in German, we're using \"ein paar\" (which literally translates to \"a couple\") a lot, usually meaning \"an undetermined amount larger than one but smaller than 'a lot'\". We are very tempted to use this the same way in English, as it comes very naturally to us - but in US English, I notice that \"a couple\" usually means \"(more or less) exactly two\", so when we mean \"some probably between 4 and 7 times\", we may end up saying \"a couple times\" and the US English native speaker understands \"twice\". Oops. We better had said \"a few times\". I learned this in detail when I requested to stay \"a couple weeks\" in the office around a work week and thought there would be later discussion of how many weeks exactly, when the other side was \"OK, he wants two weeks, he'll get two weeks\". Note that in German there is \"ein Paar\" (different capitalization) which means the same as \"a couple\", but in most cases we just say \"zwei\"/\"two\" so it can't be mistaken.<br />
<br />
On the other side, Brendan starts the reply to some questions with \"that's a good question\" - which, as I learned over the years, is a usual phrase to compliment the person the question came from and say that this is an important issue to ask and talk about. Now, in German, this literally translates to \"das ist eine gute Frage\" - which we usually say when we recognize that it's an interesting question but we still need to think about this and don't have any really fitting answer, often coming up with one as we go on this. If you're a native German speaker, be aware that English speakers don't usually have that connotation to this phrase, actually they're often happy someone asked this because it's something they have thought about long and hard and have come up with a really good answer for already. If you're not a German speaker, be aware that those who are might understand it this way and be surprised or take your answer as weaker instead of stronger as you intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure there's tons of other misunderstandings between phrases in different languages for sure, I'm mentioning those two because I heard them in this \"chat\", it's (the) two languages I know quite well, and they're even in the same language family (in linguistics called \"Germanic languages\") - and still run into things like that.<br />
I'm always interested about such nuances, if you have any to share, feel free to comment here or blog about them yourself, here in this global Mozilla community, it's always nice to learn from each other! <img alt=\":)\" class=\"icon\" src=\"http://home.kairo.at/?d=b&p=s_smile\" style=\"height: 19px; width: 19px;\" title=\"smile\" />" nil nil "98b725ad153c3949082c8582b10a4629") (37 (20928 8795 695806) "http://playingwithsid.blogspot.com/2013/06/african-network-for-localization-anloc.html" "Arky: African Network For Localization (ANLoc) Conference 2013" "Arky r" "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 10:53:27 +0000" "<p>Traveled to Johannesburg, South Africa, to attend <a href=\"http://www.africanlocalisation.net/terminology-and-localisation-africa-and-beyond\" title=\"Terminology and Localization in Africa and beyond\">African Network For Localization (ANLoc)'s Terminology and Localisation in Africa and Beyond Conference</a> earlier this year.

There were in-depth discussions on the various facets of multilingualism in cyberspace in context to African languages, the challenges of translating computing terms in African languages, the use of machine translation methods and the development of linguistics resources such language dictionaries and terminologies. The conference organizers maintained a good balance of discussions, along with practical hands-on workshops. The size of conference made interactions easier.

The ground realities of mobilizing and sustaining communities in Africa are apparent. Finding contributors is difficult. Most contributors refrain from volunteering due to economic reasons. The overall economic development and access to digital technologies is limited to few regions in Africa. The availability of Internet has improved but the cost is still prohibitively high.

The problems discussed were both at an economic and social level.

The African diaspora spread across the world and few local governments and non profit organizations were involved in developing local language content.

<p>Randell Jesup <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=872978\">fixed a leak in WebRTC code</a>.</p>
<h3>Changes to these progress reports</h3>
<p>I’ve written over sixty MemShrink progress reports in the past two years.  When I started writing them, I had two major goals.  First, to counter the notion that nobody at Mozilla cares about memory consumption — this was a common comment on tech blogs two years ago.  Second, to keep interested people informed of MemShrink progress.</p>
<p>At this point, I think the first goal has been comprehensively addressed.  (More due to the  fact that we actually have improved Firefox’s memory consumption than because I wrote a bunch of blog posts!)  As a result, I feel like the value of these posts has diminished.  I’m also tired of writing them;  long-time readers may have noticed that they are much terser than they used to be.</p>
<p>Therefore, going forward, I’m only going to post one report every four weeks.  (The MemShrink team will still meet every two weeks, however.)  I’ll also be more selective about what I write about — I’ll focus on the big improvements, and I won’t list every little leak that has been fixed, though I might post links to Bugzilla searches that list those fixes. Finally, I won’t bother recording the MemShrink bug counts.  (In fact, I’ve started that today.)  At this point it’s pretty clear that the P1 list hovers between 15 and 20 most of the time, and the P2 and P3 lists grow endlessly.</p>
<p>Apologies to anyone disappointed by this, but rest easy that it will give me more time to work on actual improvements to Firefox <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>" nil nil "78bd6a1b2833db672fd9ee0e10265f40") (34 (20928 8795 691040) "http://msujaws.wordpress.com/2013/06/11/animating-and-transitioning-displaynone-elements/" "Jared Wein: Animating and transitioning display:none elements" "msujaws" "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 03:45:23 +0000" "<p>The current release of Firefox introduces a nice animation when opening and closing the Find bar. Upon opening the Find bar, the toolbar fades in and slides up. Exiting the toolbar will make it fade out and slide down.</p>
<p>As you may or may not know, the user interface for Firefox is implemented using XUL+HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>
<p>We use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/XUL/Attribute/hidden\">the XUL <code>hidden</code> attribute</a>, which is very similar to the <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/global-attributes.html#common.attrs.hidden\">HTML5 <code>hidden</code> attribute</a>, to hide the Find bar when it is dismissed. The presence of the <code>hidden</code> attribute sets <code>display:none</code> on the referenced element. If you’ve ever played around with CSS Transitions or Animations, you’ve probably noticed that <code>display</code> is not a transitionable property.</p>
<p>To maintain add-on compatibility, as well as code simplicity, we wanted to keep using the <code>hidden</code> attribute. Doing so also allowed us to leave the JavaScript unchanged.</p>
<p>This poses a hard problem. If <code>display</code> is not transitionable, how could we animate the behavior here? It turns out that <code>visibility</code> is a transitionable property.</p>
<p>The various states of <code>visibility</code> are atomic. There is no defined behavior for what should happen when an element transitions from <code>visibility:hidden</code> to <code>visibility:visible</code> or <code>visibility:collapse</code>. However, we can use a zero second duration to make the change happen at the instant that we want.</p>
<p>This brings us to our solution:</p>

transition-property: margin-bottom, opacity, visibility;
transition-duration: 150ms, 150ms, 0s;
transition-timing-function: ease-in-out, ease-in-out, linear;
margin-bottom: 0;
opacity: 1;
}
findbar[hidden] {
/* Override display:none to make the transition work. */
display: -moz-box;
visibility: collapse;
margin-bottom: -1em;
opacity: 0;
transition-delay: 0s, 0s, 150ms;
}</pre>
<p>To explain how this works we’ll start by looking at <code>findbar[hidden]</code>, since it’s the default state for the Find bar.</p>
<p>When it is hidden, we will force it to be displayed (using <code>display:-moz-box</code>, which is an internal-to-Gecko <code>display</code> value, you could replace this with <code>display:block</code> or <code>display:inline</code> as needed). We then set <code>visibility</code> to <code>collapse</code>, which will effectively make the element invisible and also not consume any space (except for margins, which is important here). We then use a negative <code>margin-bottom</code> to force the element to be placed just out of view of the browser window. Setting <code>opacity</code> here is used to fade the element in and out. I’ll describe the <code>transition-delay</code> last.</p>
<p>When the Find bar is shown, we set <code>margin-bottom</code> to zero which will slide the toolbar up. We also set <code>opacity</code> to one which will make it fade in. The opposite happens in reverse when the Find bar is dismissed.</p>
<p>The key here is the <code>transition-delay</code> that is set in the <code>findbar[hidden]</code> case.</p>
<p>When the Find bar is hidden and transitions to being visible, we don’t have a <code>transition-delay</code> applied. This causes the <code>visibility</code> to change immediately at the beginning of the animation. The Find bar becomes visible and then it slides and fades in to view.</p>
<p>When the Find bar is visible and transitions to being hidden, we delay changing the <code>visibility</code> until the <code>margin</code> and <code>opacity</code> transitions have completed. Running the <code>visibility</code> transition immediately in this case would cause the element to disappear instantly, which would ruin the animation.</p>
<p>That explains how I implemented the Find bar transition in Firefox without affecting themes or having to change JS. It’s a pretty cool technique for showing and hiding elements, and has opened the doors to implementing some other types of animations in the Firefox user interface. Let me know what you think! <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I’ve been told by <a href=\"http://frankyan.com/\">Frank Yan</a> that this won’t work on non-XUL content since <code>display:-moz-box</code> is needed to get the <code>visibility:collapse</code> to work as needed. Still a cool technique to see!</p>

connection between <em>memory management</em> and <em>data-race freedom</em>. I want
to take a moment to elaborate on this, becaause the connection was not
obvious to me at first, but it ultimately drives a lot of the Rust
design decisions.</p>
<p>First, I believe that if you want to guarantee data-race freedom, and
you want to support the cheap transfer of mutable state between tasks,
then you must have a garbage-collector-free subset of your
language. To see what I mean by “cheap transfer of mutable state”,
consider something like double-buffering: you have one drawing and one
display task exchanging buffers (so there are only two buffers in
total).  While the drawing task is preparing the next frame, the
display task is busy displaying the current one. At the end, they
exchange buffers.  In order to prevent data races in a scenario like
this, it is vital that we be able to guarantee that when the buffers
are exchanged, neither task has any remaining references. Otherwise,
the display task would be able to read or write from the buffer that
the drawing task is currently writing on.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if we wanted to <em>free</em> one of those buffers, rather
than send it to another task, the necessary safety guaranty would be
precisely the same: we must be able to guarantee that there are no
existing aliases. Therefore, if you plan to support a scenario like
double buffering <em>and guarantee data-race freedom</em>, then you have
exactly the same set of problems to solve that you would have if you
wanted to make GC optional. Of course, you could still use a GC to
<em>actually free</em> the memory, but there is no reason to, you’re just
giving up performance. Most languages opt to give up on data-race
freedom at this point. Rust does not.</p>
<p>But there is a deeper connection than this. I’ve often thought that
while data-races in a technical sense can only occur in a parallel
system, problems that <em>feel</em> a lot like data races crop up all the
time in sequential systems. One example would be what C++ folk call
<em>iterator invalidation</em>—basically, if you are iterating over a
hashtable and you try to modify the hashtable during that iteration,
you get undefined behavior. Sometimes your iteration skips keys or
values, sometimes it shows you the new key, sometimes it doesn’t, etc.
In C++, this leads to crashes. In Java, this (hopefully) leads to an
exception.</p>
<p>But whatever the outcome, iterator invalidation feels very similar to
a data race. The problem often arises because you have one piece of
code iterating over a hashtable and then calling a subroutine defined
over in some other module. This other module then writes to the same
hashtable.  Both modules look fine on their own, it’s only the
combination of the two that causes the issue. And because of the
undefined nature of the result, it often happens that the code works
fine for a long time—until it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Rust’s type system prevents iterator invalidation. Often this can be
done statically. But if you use <code>@mut</code> types, that is, mutable managed
data, we do the detection dynamically. Even in the dynamic case, the
guarantee that you get is much stronger than what Java gives with
fail-fast iteration: Rust guarantees failure, and in fact it even
points at the two pieces of code that are conflicting (though if you
build optimized, we can only provide you with one of those locations,
since tracking the other causes runtime overhead right now).</p>
<p>One reason that we are so intolerant towards iterator invalidation is
because we wish to guarantee memory safety, and we wish to do so
without the use of universal garbage collection (since, as I just
argued before, it is basically unnecessary if you also guarantee
data-race freedom). Without a garbage collector, iterator invalidation
can lead to dangling pointers or other similar problems. But even
<em>with</em> a garbage collector, iterator invalidation leads to undefined
behavior, which can in turn imply that your browser can be compromised
by code that can exploit that behavior. So it’s an all-around bad
thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think it is no accident that the same type-system tools
that combat iterator invalidation wind up being
<a href=\"http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/06/11/data-parallelism-in-rust/\">useful to fight data-races</a>. Essentially I believe these are two
manifestations of the same problem—unexpected aliasing—in one
case, expressed in a parallel setting, and in the other, in a
sequential setting. The sequential case is mildly simpler, in that in
a sequential setting you at least have a happens-before relationship
between any two pairs of accesses, which does not hold in a parallel
setting.  This is why we tolerate <code>&const</code> and <code>&mut</code> aliases in
sequential code, but forbid them with closure bounds in parallel code.</p>
<p>In some way this observation is sort of banal. Of course mutating
without knowledge of possible aliases gets you into trouble. But I
think it’s also profound, in a way, because it suggests that these two
seemingly unrelated issues, memory management and data races, cannot
be truly separated (except by sacrificing mutability).</p>
<p>Most languages make no effort to control aliasing; if anything, they
use universal garbage collection to prevent the end user from having
to reason about when aliasing might exist to a given piece of
data. This works well for guaranteeing memory is not freed, but as
I’ve suggested, it can lead to a variety of incorrect behaviors if
mutation is permitted.</p>
<p>This observation has motivated a lot of the research into ownership
types and linear types, research which Rust draws on. Of other recent
non-research languages, the only other that I know which takes the
approach of controlling aliasing is <a href=\"http://parasail-programming-language.blogspot.com/\">Parasail</a>. Not
coincidentally, I would argue, both Rust and Parasail guarantee
data-race freedom, while most langauges do not.</p>" nil nil "bb8edfe19ee297590a885400ef9dea26") (31 (20928 8795 688496) "https://blog.mozilla.org/vdjeric/2013/06/11/performance-update-issue-3/" "Vladan Djeric: Performance Update, Issue #3" "Vladan Djeric" "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 18:00:12 +0000" "<p><em>This is a post summarizing the activities of the Performance team over the past week.

actors which exchange messages and do not share memory. However, there
are many tasks for which actors are not a good fit. The unbounded
lifetime of actors means that they cannot safely access
stack-allocated memory from another task, even if it is
immutable. Actors cannot share memory except through the relatively
clumsy (and somewhat expensive) mechanism of <code>Arc</code> structures (which
stands for “atomic reference count”), meaning that if there are large
data structures they can be a pain to access. <code>Arc</code> is also
inapplicable to data structures that transition between mutable and
immutable and back again.</p>
<p>I was recently pointed to the paper
<a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1953616\">“Three layer cake for shared-memory programming”</a>, which
describes perfectly the direction in which I would like to see Rust
go. Message passing is retained at the top-level, but within an actor,
you have support for fork-join concurrency. I’ve been calling these
fork-join tasks “jobs”. Within a job, you can get yet more concurrency
via SIMD primitives.</p>
<p>To that end, I’ve been working on promising design for fork-join
concurrency in Rust. I am very pleased both because the API looks like
it will be simple, flexible, and easy to use, and because we are able
to statically guarantee data-race freedom <em>even with full support for
shared memory</em> with only minimal, generally applicable modifications
to the type system (closure bounds, a few new built-in traits). The
scheme also requires no changes to the runtime; it can be implemented
simply as a library.</p>
<p>In particular, the existing borrow checker rules, which were aimed at
preventing dangling pointers, turn out to be extremely well-suited to
this task.  I find this very interesting and very heartening as well,
and I think it points to a kind of deeper analogy between memory
errors in sequential programs and data races in parallel programs.
I will elaborate on this theory in a later post.</p>
<h3>The API</h3>
<p>The API is based on a fork-join model. There are a number of helper
functions, each of which starts up a number of parallel jobs and
returns when those jobs have completed. The API builds on Rust’s type
system to statically guarantee data-race freedom. Under typical usage,
in fact, the API even guarantees deterministic results, though this
guarantee can be voided by making use of locks, ports, and certain
other advanced types.</p>
<p>I have adopted the term <code>job</code> to distinguish the lightweight parallel
tasks that from Rust’s normal tasks. Although both can be used for
parallel execution, they are quite different in most other respects.
For example, jobs all share the same memory space as their parent
task, whereas tasks are strictly isolated from one another.  Jobs also
have a fixed lifetime, whereas tasks run asynchronously. In general,
executing a parallel job is supposed to act exactly as though the text
of that job were inlined into the task body, modulo certain observable
timing differences (and nondeterminism around locks and message
ordering).</p>
<p>To some extent, the API that I’m going to discuss is a strawman.
Expect changes to the details, of course. Also, I only present the
primitive operations here; there will be a number of higher-level
wrappers for common operations (like parallel map and reduce and so
forth). In keeping with the <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1953616\">“three layer cake”</a> idea, these
higher-level primitives may employ SIMD as well.</p>
<h4>Parallel execute</h4>
<p>The most primitive method in Parallel arsenal is <code>parallel::execute(jobs)</code>,
which takes an array of closures and executes the closures in parallel
jobs (well, at least potentially—it may opt to run them sequentially
if insufficient parallel resources exist). Once these jobs complete,
<code>execute()</code> returns.</p>
<p>These closures are permitted to share memory and capture values by
reference.  We will see later that the type checker will validate that
if one of these jobs writes to a particular value, then none of the
other jobs can access it; you are allowed however to access the same
data so long as all jobs treat it as immutable.</p>
<p>To make the usage more concrete, here is an example that uses
<code>parallel::execute</code> to sum up the values in a binary tree in parallel.
Note that no heap allocation is required at any point in the
iteration, which is nice from a performance point of view.</p>
<pre><code>struct Tree {
val: uint,
left: Option<~Tree>,
right: Option<~Tree>,
}
fn sum_tree(tree: &Tree) -> uint {
let mut left_sum = 0;
let mut right_sum = 0;
parallel::execute([
|| left_sum = sum_opt_tree(&tree.left),
|| right_sum = sum_opt_tree(&tree.right),
]);
left_sum + right_sum + tree.val
}
fn sum_opt_tree(tree: &Option<~Tree>) -> uint {
match tree {
Some(~ref t) => sum_tree(t),
None => 0,
}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The type of <code>execute()</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>fn execute(jobs: &[fn:Isolate()])
</code></pre>
<p>Here the <code>fn:Isolate()</code> means “a closure that only closes over state
that is either shared or isolated from other threads”. I’ll explain
this bound and the other details of static safety checking shortly.</p>
<h4>Parallel divide</h4>
<p>The other primitive parallel operation is <code>divide()</code>, which takes a
mutable slice and a closure. It will divide up the slice into a number
of subslices and invoke your closure on it; the precise means that it
uses to divide the subslice is unspecified. You can also configure
<code>divide()</code> with the minimum granularity that it should use when dividing
the array (for example, you might prefer to be called back with
subslices that are a multiple of 10 items).</p>
<p>In a way, <code>execute()</code> is more fundamental than <code>divide()</code>, as you can
implement <code>divide()</code> using <code>execute()</code> by recursively dividing the array
in half. However, I choose to call <code>divide()</code> a second primitive because
it can be far more efficient to divide the array using other
strategies, such as determining how many worker threads are available
and just chopping the slice into <code>N</code> equal parts (of course this will
depend on the workload).</p>
<p>The reason that <code>divide()</code> provides you with a mutable subslice, rather
than say a pointer to an individual element, is that often there is
setup work that can be shared between consecutive elements when
processing an array. Consider the following example, which treates a
vector <code>v</code> as a 2d array, and invokes the closure <code>f</code> in parallel with
each element in the array and its <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinate. In this
case, the initial computation of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> from the index in <code>v</code> is
relatively expensive, as it requires division, but updating <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> is very cheap. Using <code>divide()</code>, the initial division can be
amortized over a large subslice.</p>
<pre><code>fn update_two_dim<T>(v: &mut [T],
width: uint,
f: fn:Share(&mut T, x: uint, y: uint)) {
assert!(v.len() % width == 0);
do parallel::divide(array, 1) |slice, offset| {
let mut (x, y) = (offset % width, offset / width);
for slice.each_mut |p| {
update(p, x, y);
x += 1;
if x == width {
x = 0;
y += 1;
}
}
}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The type of <code>divide()</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>fn divide<T>(data: &mut [T],
granularity: uint,
job: fn:Share(&mut [T], uint))
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll note that the type of the closure is different from
<code>execute()</code>. Whereas before we had <code>fn:Isolate</code>, for <code>divide()</code> we
have <code>fn:Share</code>. This is in fact a tighter bound that only permits
content that can safely be accessed in parallel by multiple
threads. The difference is due to the fact that, with <code>execute()</code>,
each closure got its own parallel job, but with <code>divide()</code>, the same
closure will be called simultaneously from multiple jobs.</p>
<h3>Checking safety</h3>
<p>So how can we guarantee that these APIs are used safely? For example,
what ensures that the user doesn’t write a program like this one (variations
on this example will serve as examples through this section):</p>
<pre><code>fn compute_foo_and_bar(dataset: &[uint]) -> (uint, uint) {
let mut foo = 0;
let mut bar = 0;
parallel::execute([
|| foo = compute_foo(dataset),
|| foo = compute_bar(dataset), // <-- Bug here!
]);
(foo, bar)
}
fn compute_foo(dataset: &[uint]) -> uint { ... }
fn compute_bar(dataset: &[uint]) -> uint { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the function <code>compute_foo_and_bar()</code> creates two
closures, one of which creates <code>compute_foo()</code> and one of which
invokes <code>compute_bar()</code>. The two closures run in parallel.  However,
there is a slight bug: both closures write to <code>foo</code>, though presumably
the author meant for the second closure to write to <code>bar</code>. Therefore,
this program will be rejected as racy: let’s see how the borrow
checker comes to that conclusion.</p>
<h4>Desugaring closures</h4>
<p>In fact, this conclusion falls out of the normal borrow checker safety
rules for closures (more accurately, it <em>will</em> fall out of those rules
once I fix them).  The way the borrow checker handles closures is
essentially to “desugar” them into the pair of a struct that contains
pointers and a fn pointer.  To see what, let’s examine the first
closure from our example in more detail:</p>
<pre><code>|| foo = compute_foo(dataset)
</code></pre>
<p>If we wanted to model this closure more precisely, we could
consider it as the pair of an environment struct and a function.
It would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>struct FooEnv {
foo: &mut uint,
dataset: &[uint]
}
fn foo_fn(env: &mut TheEnv) {
*env.foo = compute_foo(env.dataset);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This means that the call to <code>parallel::execute</code> would look something
like this:</p>
<pre><code>parallel::execute([
// Roughly equivalent to `|| foo = compute_foo(dataset)`
(&FooEnv {foo: &mut foo, dataset: dataset}, foo_fn),
// Roughly equivalent to `|| bar = compute_bar(dataset)`
(&BarEnv {bar: &mut foo, dataset: dataset}, bar_fn),
])
</code></pre>
<p>This is in fact the kind of code that gets generated at runtime.  The
interesting thing about looking at closure creations this way is that
we can apply the standard Rust borrowing rules to them. In particular,
we see that there are two mut borrows of the variable <code>foo</code>, and those
borrows have overlapping lifetimes, which is not permitted.</p>
<h4>The role of closure bounds</h4>
<p>As the previous example showed, the borrow checker’s normal rules
already gives us many of the guarantees we require. We covered
specifically how the borrow checker handles closures, but in general
the borrow check guarantees that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&mut T</code> pointers are the <em>only way</em> to modify the memory that they
point at (thus guaranteeing that if job A has an <code>&mut</code> pointer,
no other job can be writing that memory);</li>
<li><code>&T</code> pointers are <em>immutable</em> (thus guaranteeing that if job A has a
<code>&T</code> pointer, no job can be writing to that memory).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are several guarantees that the borrow checker does
<em>not</em> provide which are unnecessary in a sequential context but become
important when discussing data races:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although <code>&mut T</code> pointers are the only way to <em>mutate</em> the memory
they point at, they are not the only way to <em>read</em> the memory they
point at. Both <code>&const T</code> and <code>@mut T</code> can produce read-only
aliases; thus is one job holds an <code>&mut T</code> and another an <code>&const
T</code>, the two jobs could race.</li>
<li>The Rust standard library includes a number of types that include
“interior mutability”, meaning mutability inherent in the type
itself, vs imposed from the outside. Examples are <code>@mut</code>, <code>RcMut</code>,
and <code>Cell</code>. Many of these types are not threadsafe, with the notable
exception of <code>RwArc</code>, which employs mutual exclusion.</li>
<li>Managed pointers like <code>@T</code> and <code>@mut T</code> are currently not safe
to pass between parallel jobs, though in the case of <code>@T</code> this is
an implementation limitation and not a theoretical one.</li>
</ul>
<p>What all this means is that if the <code>parallel::execute()</code> accepted an
array of any old closures, it could be sure that those closures would
not race on any <code>&mut T</code> or <code>&T</code> values that they may have access to,
but races could arise if those closures had access to <code>&const T</code>
values (not to mention <code>@mut T</code>, <code>Cell</code>, and so on).</p>
<p>There is a similar danger for <code>parallel::divide()</code>. Unlike
<code>execute()</code>, which accepts an array of closures and executes each one
from its own parallel job, <code>divide()</code> accepts a single closure and it
invokes that same closure many times in parallel. This means that if
the closure were close over an <code>&mut</code> pointer, that <em>same pointer</em>
would be available to many threads, and thus races could arise.</p>
<h5>Enter closure bounds</h5>
<p>We prevent both of these scenarios with <em>closure bounds</em>. A closure
bound is a limitation on the kinds of values that a closure can
contain in its environment. This is directly analogous to the bounds
that appear on type parameters in generic functions. For example,
if we declare a generic function <code>f</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>fn f<T:Freeze>(v: &[T]) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>The bound <code>:Freeze</code> on <code>T</code> indicates that <code>T</code> may only be used with
values that are freezable (which means “no interior mutability”, so
e.g. <code>@mut</code> and <code>Cell</code> are excluded). Similarly, the type
<code>fn:Freeze()</code> would indicate a function whose environment contained
only freezable values.</p>
<p>As currently planned, closure bounds are less general than the
bounds which appear on type parameters, in that they are limited to
the “built-in” traits like <code>Freeze</code> and <code>Send</code>. These traits differ
from other traits in that they offer no methods and you never explicitly
implement them. The traits are used to describe properties of the data
in question, like whether it may be mutable, and the compiler just
decides automatically whether a given type belongs to this trait or
not. Normally, the compiler would never consider a closure type <code>fn()</code>
to be a member of such a trait, because it does not know what data the
closure contains, but this does not necessarily apply to bounded
closure types.  For example, the type <code>fn:Freeze()</code> is itself a member
of <code>Freeze</code>.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the future we can extend closure bounds to arbitrary
traits. For example, a type like <code>fn:Eq()</code> might permit deep
comparison of closure environments, or <code>fn:Clone()</code> could permit deep
cloning.  I haven’t thought deeply about this, though, and it would
presumably require some sort of <code>impl</code> based on reflection.</p>
<h5>Closure bounds apply to “desugared” environments</h5>
<p>One thing that is not entirely obvious is that closure bounds refer to
the <em>desugared references</em> found in a closure environment. Recall
that a closure like <code>|| foo = compute_foo(dataset)</code> in fact desugars
to an environment where <code>foo</code> is represented as an <code>&mut</code> pointer:</p>
<pre><code>struct FooEnv {
foo: &mut uint,
dataset: &[uint]
}
</code></pre>
<p>This means that such a closure would not be considered to meet the bound
<code>Freeze</code>, because in its environment the field <code>foo</code> is an <code>&mut</code>
pointer, which is not freezable. This is true even though the type of
the <em>variable</em> <code>foo</code> is just <code>uint</code>, which does meet <code>Freeze</code>.</p>
<p>As a side-effect, a closure of type <code>fn:Send()</code> can only exist as a
coercion from an environment-less function, since any true closure
will have borrowed pointers of <em>some kind</em> in its environment, and
they are not sendable.</p>
<p><em>Hat tip</em>: Promising Young Intern <a href=\"http://winningraceconditions.blogspot.com/\">bblum</a> first expressed this
view of closure bounds. It is much cleaner than the formulation I had
before, which included some ad-hoc rules to achieve the same effect.</p>
<h5><code>execute</code> and the <code>Isolate</code> bound</h5>
<p>You may recall that the <code>parallel::execute()</code> fn was declared as <code>fn
execute(jobs: &[fn:Isolate()])</code>. As the type indicates, it accepts an
array of closures that carry the <code>Isolate</code> bound. The <code>Isolate</code> bound
accepts “all values that can be transmitted and isolated to a single
parallel job”, which in practice means:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&mut T</code> where <code>T:Isolate</code></li>
<li><code>&T</code> where <code>T:Isolate</code></li>
<li>Scalar values like <code>uint</code>, <code>int</code>, etc</li>
<li>Structs, tuples, and enums if all components can be isolated,
and the types are not internally mutable</li>
<li>The “atomic ref count” type <code>Arc</code></li>
<li>The “mutex” type <code>RwArc</code></li>
<li>Closures that can be isolated (i.e., <code>fn:Isolate(T1, T2) -> T3</code>, where
<code>T1</code>, <code>T2</code>, and <code>T3</code> need not meet any bound in particular)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this list excludes both <code>&const T</code> and <code>@mut T</code>, as well as
types like <code>Cell</code>, <code>Rc</code>, and <code>RcMut</code> that employ internal mutation.
The list still includes a number of mutable types, however:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&mut T</code> is safe because, as discussed previously, if one closure has
access to an <code>&mut T</code>, then none of the other closures has access
to that same value.</li>
<li><code>Arc</code> is safe because its reference counters are maintained atomically.</li>
<li><code>RwArc</code> is safe because it uses a mutex to guarantee that any
mutation which occurs is always threadsafe.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Isolate</code> bound excludes all managed data. More discussion on this
topic is found below.</p>
<h5><code>divide</code> and the <code>Share</code> bound</h5>
<p>The <code>divide</code> function is declared as follows:</p>
<pre><code>fn divide<T:Isolate>(data: &mut [T],
granularity: uint,
job: fn:Share(&mut [T], uint))
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>job</code> closure requires the <code>Share</code> bound, which
specifies data that can be safely shared amongst many parallel jobs
(meaning, the same value can be accessed simultaneously by many jobs
at once). The data that is being divided only requires the <code>Isolate</code>
bound, since that data will never be accessible to multiple jobs at a
time.</p>
<p>The definition of <code>Share</code> is a subset of <code>Isolate</code> that excludes <code>&mut</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&T</code> where <code>T:Share</code></li>
<li>Scalar values like <code>uint</code>, <code>int</code>, etc</li>
<li>Structs, tuples, and enums if all components can be shared,
and the types are not internally mutable</li>
<li>The “atomic ref count” type <code>Arc</code></li>
<li>The “mutex” type <code>RwArc</code></li>
<li>Closures that can be shared (i.e., <code>fn:Share(T1, T2) -> T3</code>, where
<code>T1</code>, <code>T2</code>, and <code>T3</code> need not meet any bound in particular)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that it is still safe to share <code>RwArc</code> (the mutex type).</p>
<h5>Relationship of <code>Isolate</code> and <code>Share</code> to existing bounds</h5>
<p>Rust already has two “built-in” bounds, <code>Freeze</code> and <code>Send</code>, which are
both somewhat more strict that <code>Isolate</code> and <code>Share</code> (<code>Freeze</code>, for
example, would reject <code>RwArc</code>, and <code>Send</code> would reject all <code>&T</code> or
<code>@T</code> values). I think the full hierarchy is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Isolate
Share
Freeze
Send
</code></pre>
<p>Here the indentation is intended to indicate an inclusion
relationship.  In other words, anything that meets <code>Send</code> or <code>Freeze</code>
meets both <code>Isolate</code> and <code>Share</code>, but not vice versa. Similarly,
anything that meets <code>Share</code> meets <code>Isolate</code>, but not vice versa.</p>
<h4>Extending to permit sharing of managed data</h4>
<p>In general we can implement a minimal version of this scheme with no
changes to the runtime. The parallel job dispatching can be
implemented as a library building on the existing scheduler. Unsafe
code would be used to “leak” the closures outside of one task and into
another. This is safe because we know that parent thread will be
blocking, and thus the stack-allocated closures will remain valid;
data-race-freedom is then guaranteed by the mechanisms I have already
discussed. Once the jobs are executed over on the tasks, messages are
sent back and the <code>execute</code> or <code>divide</code> function returns and permits
the main thread to resume executing.</p>
<p>If we wanted to allow <code>@T</code> values to be passed to parallel jobs, we
would have to make some deeper changes. First, this is incompatible
with the non-atomic reference counting and cycle collection mechanism
we use today. Even when we move to a tracing collector, though, we
will have to generalize the collector to permit multiple parallel jobs
to access in parallel. This is still a more limited setting than a
full-on cross-process garbage collector, as you find in JVMs, but it
will nonetheless add significant complexity. Similar issues arise in
PJS; I have a blog post coming out soon that will discuss some of our
plans in that regard, most of which apply equally to Rust, though not
entirely, because the Rust model is more general than PJS.</p>
<p>Note that nothing prevents parallel jobs from allocating and using
<code>@T</code> and other values internally. This is fine; we are guaranteed that
these values cannot outlive the parallel job because the closure
cannot closure over any location that could store such values, and the
closure argument and return types must always meet the <code>Isolate</code>
bound.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This post summarizes my current thinking about how to achieve
ligher-weight data parallelism in Rust. The critical differences
between the <em>parallel jobs</em> described here and the existing tasks are
that <em>jobs</em> would have access to borrowed pointers and thus to data
found in the stack frame and even, to some extent, managed heap of the
parent task. Jobs would always have a fixed lifetime and follow a
fork-join pattern. Parallel jobs as I describe form the “second layer”
in the <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1953616\">“three layer cake” of parallel programming</a>, enabling
fork-join parallelism while retaining deterministic semantics (modulo
the use of <code>RwArc</code>). They can also form the basis for a number of
higher-level APIs and combine well with future extensions to support
SIMD.</p>" nil nil "baf7fecae4cca188d5c0b8a3ba13758d") (29 (20928 8795 683988) "https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2013/06/11/total-surveillance/" "Mitchell Baker: Total Surveillance" "mitchell" "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 15:13:43 +0000" "<p>Imagine you live in a world where the buildings are glass and you can’t ever close the curtains. Imagine the floor is glass, the ceiling is glass and all the walls are glass. There are no curtains, no window shades, no shutters and you can’t make your own. We’re heading into this world online. A robust network, cheap sensors and massive data manipulation builds the equivalent of glass houses.</p>
<p>The question today is whether we can have curtains. Whether any business or ecosystem provides curtains and whether we can make our own. Today we have very little ability to close the curtains in commercial activities. Websites are technically able to track *everything* we do, from how long we stay on a page to what ads attract us to how to travel from one website to the next. The data about you can be sold to others. Online data can be combined with data from your physical world and made available or sold to others  Telephone providers know when we make a phone call, where we made it from, who we called, how long we talked, our regular patterns of calls, and more.</p>
<p>Now we know that the U.S. government is gathering significant quantities of this data. Currently it’s understood to be using only “metadata” about phone calls for U.S. citizens, and to be using the actual content as well for foreign nationals. Now we also know that the inability to pull the curtains applies to governments as well.  We can also wonder how many other governments are collecting these types of data.</p>
<p>Now is the moment to ask — do we care?  Do care how much our government watches us, tracks us without our knowing it? Do we care how  the U.S. government treats the citizens of friendly, allied states? Do we care if other governments emulate the U.S. and gather this data?   How do businesses, organizations and individuals approach the US knowing the scope of online activities that are being monitored?  How much do other governments do this — either to  citizens or to foreign nationals?</p>
<div id=\"magicdomid66\">
<p>How do we balance between civil rights and national security?</p>
<p>At Mozilla we have a long, deep focus on individual control of online life, including the degree of privacy a person wants. We build products to promote this goal, and we will continue to do so. In essence, we try to provide the option of pulling the curtains for individual citizens.</p>
<p>However, products do not make government policies. This is the role of  citizens. We urge all citizens to get involved with the issue of wholesale government surveillance. It will determine the realities of  online life going forward.  Our online houses are become increasingly built of glass. Our lives our increasingly visible to whomever wants to look.</p>

<p>I was intrigued, answered Jack and got a second mail with the link to this video. I love it – it is a great example how to present research information in a short, informative and creative way. Whilst I am utterly tired of <a href=\"http://memebase.cheezburger.com/ragecomics\">rage comics</a> and consider them a massive waste of bandwidth and perceived creativity it makes sense to use them here to show what the research was about. I learned a few things, for example I did not know trolling came from fishing and that there were even trolls on ham radio in the past. The best, however is the advice at the end.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>Trolling is not a game of solitaire. Unless we want to actively suppress freedom of speech, the only way to beat a troll is to not play the game.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>In other words – don’t feed the troll.</p>

It also brings up some of the more interesting questions. Let me explain:</p>
<p>Apple <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2013/\">announced</a> today that they paid out 10 billion USD to their iOS developers both through direct app sales as well as in-app purchases. 5 billion USD of those were paid out just last year (which points to accelerated growth of the iOS ecosystem). According to Apple this represents 74% of the total market for mobile phone app purchases (with Android accounting for 20% and others for the remaining 6%).</p>
<p>Further take into account that mobile phones are not only creating direct economic opportunity through their app stores but also enable numerous other forms of generated revenue and you get an interesting picture (e.g. e-commerce which originates from a mobile phone; eBay <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130116006423/en/eBay-Reports-Strong-Fourth-Quarter-Full-Year\">reported</a> 13 billion USD in gross merchandise sales going through their mobile app in 2012 alone).</p>
<p>Consider that Firefox OS plays a different game – both from a technical as well as a target market perspective (using the Web as the platform, thus being much more open and targeting emerging markets respectively) and the really fascinating question becomes: Outside of the obvious economic opportunities \"direct on-device commerce through app stores\" and mobile/e-commerce as well as content consumption (music, videos, books) – <strong>which other forms of economic opportunity can we enable and drive through the device?</strong> And in this context: What can we (Mozilla) do to foster and/or enable this?</p>
<p>We are already seeing interesting opportunities <em>especially</em> in emerging markets – from mobile banking for the previously unbanked (e.g. Safaricom's and Vodafone's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa\">M-Pesa</a>) to market information systems for farmers (using SMS messaging - e.g. Intuit's <a href=\"http://fasal.intuit.com/\">Fasal</a>) and much more.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that \"<em>we (mostly) don't know what we don't know</em>\". That this is likely one of the biggest opportunities we have with Firefox OS. And that it will mostly be the communities/entrepreneurs on the ground who will create and capture these opportunities.</p>
<p>The question remains: <strong>What can we, as Mozilla, do to inspire, enable, foster and grow these ventures? What is missing? What do we need to create to make this happen?</strong></p>

<h3 id=\"vsync\">Vsync</h3>
<p>Vsync has finally <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856427\">landed</a> on Windows Nightlies not long ago. This means that Firefox will now synchronize its paints with the actual refresh rate of the monitor (if available), which is essential for properly smooth animations. This will work (and is enabled by default) on Windows Vista and later with DWM enabled (“Aero” themes). This also works with WebGL content such as <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2013/05/02/epic-citadel-demo-shows-the-power-of-the-web-as-a-platform-for-gaming/\">Epic Citadel</a> (<a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">demo</a>).</p>
<p>Without vsync, Firefox uses 60hz refresh rate by default, which works relatively decently with 60hz displays, but fails badly at displaying properly smooth animations on monitors with other refresh rates (50hz on quite a few laptop displays, 100hz monitors, etc).</p>
<p>However, the current implementation synchronizes with the main display only, so if using a multi-monitor setup, Firefox windows on secondary monitors might not gain from this.</p>
<p>You can control the refresh rate manually by modifying <code>layout.frame_rate</code> at <code>about:config</code> (and restart Firefox). The default value is <code>-1</code> which means “Use vsync if available or 60hz otherwise”. Any other integer value > 0 will force that specific refresh rate.</p>
<p>Naturally, if Firefox can’t animate specific content quickly enough to keep up with the designated rate, then the actual rate will be lower.</p>
<h3 id=\"aboutnewtab\">about:newtab</h3>
<p><code>about:newtab</code> is the default page when opening a new empty tab - with the thumbnails of recently visited pages. It was <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=752839#c11\">affecting tab animations badly</a>, to the point of displaying as little as a 3 frames slideshow on low-end systems while animating the tabstrip after pressing the <code>+</code> button to add a tab.</p>
<p><em>Tim Taubert</em> from the Firefox team has done some extensive work <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=843853\">recently</a> on several bugs which fall into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable newtab <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=791670\">preload by default</a>. Newtab preload means that Firefox prepares the newtab page in the background, such that when opening a new tab it’s already rendered and therefore could be quickly displayed with very little processing. It has been working for a while but disabled by default due to accessibility issues. <em>Tim</em> removed this blocker, as well as simplified the preload mechanism and made sure that background preload <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875509\">doesn’t happen during animation</a>. This landed about a week ago and newtab preload is now enabled by default on nightlies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent unnecessary reflows of the newtab page. Reflow is the process of re-calculating the layout of the page, e.g. after window resize, and it’s relatively CPU intensive. Tim discovered that newtab causes <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=876374\">unnecessary reflows</a> on several cases, some of them <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875257\">related to preload</a>. He fixed them and also added an automatic test to detect if new reflows are accidentally introduced over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of all this work is that animating a new tab with the newtab page is now almost as smooth as opening a blank tab, with few further potential improvements to be worked on soon. Well done!</p>
<h3 id=\"talos\">Talos</h3>
<p><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=590422\">Bug 590422</a> (remove timers averaging filter) landed more than two months ago and should greatly improve timers accuracy, but it caused few regressions which are still being worked on. Talos <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=845943\">tscroll</a> was already modified as a result - which landed about 2 weeks ago, and recently <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=854746\">tsvg regressions</a> from this bug were examined as well.</p>
<p>As it turned out, tsvg was rendering SVG animations at 100-200ms intervals, and measuring/reporting the overall runtime as representative of SVG performance. At 4 of the 7 animation tests within the tsvg suite, more than 95% of the time was spent inside <code>setTimeout</code> with the browser completely idle. This resulted in tests which in practice represent the accuracy of timers more than anything else.</p>
<p>To make sure the overall runtime represents actual SVG performance, we should iterate the animation frames as fast as possible. We could do this with <code>setTimeout(loop, 0)</code>, but since Firefox renders to screen at 60hz, and it’s usually smart enough to delay reflow calculations until it’s absolutely necessary, we could end up fully processing only one in few frames when the SVG iterations are quicker than 60Hz, and at tsvg they’re much quicker than that.</p>
<p>To make sure each frame is fully processed on each iteration, we should therefore use <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> (fondly nicked <code>rAF</code>) - which makes sure that once we’re back at the callback, whatever layout changes which we introduced were already fully processed and flushed by Firefox. However, <code>rAF</code> iterates at 60hz by default (or vsync rate), which is usually not fast enough to stress our SVG tests. The solution is to set <code>layout.frame_rate</code> to a high enough value (during these tests) which causes Firefox to iterate and fully-process each frame as fast as possible. <em>Joel Maher</em> helps a lot with testing and deploying the new tsvg tests, and we hope to land it soon.</p>
<p>Making tsvg iterate ASAP also brought us back to tscroll. The recent change of tscroll was to use <code>rAF</code> instead of <code>setTimeout</code> for scroll iterations. However, while it represents scroll smoothness under normal conditions, it doesn’t detect small regressions - since Firefox isn’t actually being stressed and the scroll doesn’t limit our iteration frequency. But stressing the browser with ASAP iteration will lose the real-world simulation of normal refresh rates. So we don’t have a single approach to satisfy both of these needs.</p>
<p>We’re still <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=771326\">considering this</a>, but it seems talos will eventually run tscroll twice: once @60hz to make sure we can keep up at real-world scenarios, and once with ASAP iterations to detect performance regressions at much higher resolutions.</p>
<h3 id=\"paint-starvation\">Paint starvation</h3>
<p>While working on tsvg with ASAP iterations, we noticed that Firefox sometimes appears frozen for the entire animation (typically less than 1 second) - it only shows the last animation frame. While this happened when <code>rAF</code> was set to iterate ASAP, we discovered that there are scenarios under perfectly normal conditions which would exhibit exactly the same symptom.</p>
<p>This is now <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=880036\">bug 880036</a>. It shows is that if, for some reason, Firefox can’t iterate frames as fast as it wants to (60hz by default), then it may spend too much time on these iteration and prevent other event types from being handled on time. The most noticeable one is the paint event, since it makes Firefox appear frozen, but possibly other events are starved as well.</p>
<p>A patch which seems to fix the issue was already posted, but since this freeze appears to ‘fix’ itself after about 2s, we want to first understand this unfreeze mechanism, and possibly fix it instead of posting a patch to cover up for another bug.</p>" nil nil "c5928aaf3e52977ca8a158a4c6ebb6d5") (23 (20928 8795 679405) "http://relengofthenerds.blogspot.com/2013/06/releng-2013-recap.html" "Kim Moir: Releng 2013 Recap" "Kim Moir" "Mon, 10 Jun 2013 17:49:00 +0000" "On May 20, we held the Releng 2013 workshop in San Francisco.  By all accounts it was a success!  I was unsure what to expect given that this was a first time for this workshop.   It seemed to be a topic that generated a lot of interest.  We had around 80 attendees which to my understanding was the highest attendance of any workshop at <a href=\"http://2013.icse-conferences.org/\">ICSE</a> this year.   It was great to have so many people interested in release engineering and research in the room.  It was also fantastic to meet my co-organizers <a href=\"http://mcis.polymtl.ca/~bram/\">Bram</a>, <a href=\"http://www.polymtl.ca/recherche/rc/en/professeurs/details.php?NoProf=554\">Foutse</a> and <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/cbird/\">Christian</a> in person after working to organize this event since last fall.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

The panel started out with professors Mike Godrey from Waterloo and Gunther Ruhe from the university of Calgary, as well as practitioners Jason Newblanc from Salesforce and Curt Patrick from Netflix.  Discussions included what topics needed more research (dependency analysis), to  a discussion of the skills do you look for when hiring a good release engineer (communication skills above all).  Given that one of the main goals of the workshop was to bring together researchers and release engineers it was very gratifying to hear from the researchers on the panel how happy they were that they had the opportunity to learn from the presentations earlier in the day.  After a while the panel shifted to include new members with new topics, and then we wrapped up to head to post-workshop dinners where the discussions continued.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rJzt3Ot0nII/UbW8xQLAEuI/AAAAAAAAD00/Y-4hxXTVaD4/s1600/IMG_1581.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"286\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rJzt3Ot0nII/UbW8xQLAEuI/AAAAAAAAD00/Y-4hxXTVaD4/s320/IMG_1581.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><br />Several attendees mentioned to me that they were happy to attend the workshop because it validated the release engineering work that they do is important.   I'm very  fortunate to work at Mozilla on a large release engineering team where  there are many people who love to talk about build optimization and  automation.  But many release engineers work in organizations where they  are the only ones who are interested in this subject.   To bring  all these people together was a great experience!<br /><br />We would like to thank everyone who attended the workshop.  Thank you to our session chairs who timed the talks and ensure that we stayed on schedule.   Thank you to Juliana Saraiva, our student volunteer, who helped with setup and throughout the day with audio and visual issues.  <br />A special thanks to all of our speakers.  Having been a speaker in the past, I understand all the work that goes into preparing talks on top of your regular day jobs and truly appreciate the effort that made this workshop successful.  At the end of the day, there was a resounding show of hands from attendees that they would like to attend another workshop.  In fact, several companies volunteered to  their space to host events which is very generous.   Please follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/relengcon\">@relengcon</a> on twitter for more information on upcoming events.  Many of the papers and presentations are available on the <a href=\"http://releng.polymtl.ca/program.html\">web site</a>.  If your slides are missing from the web site, please email them to <a href=\"http://mcis.polymtl.ca/~bram/\">Bram</a>.<br /><br />Also thank you to my colleagues at Mozilla for arranging our releng work week to be same week so many of us could attend, despite it being a Canadian holiday weekend.  You're all amazing :-)" nil nil "9e05940876ad92f204b84679e731e420") (22 (20928 8795 678066) "http://christianheilmann.com/2013/06/10/irregular-shape-rollovers-with-canvas-and-png/" "Christian Heilmann: Irregular shape rollovers with Canvas and PNG" "Chris Heilmann" "Mon, 10 Jun 2013 15:02:54 +0000" "<p>Creating rollovers is easy.

<p>There are many solutions to this, like <span class=\"caps\">SVG</span> masking or adding lots of rectangular overlays that make up the desired shape, but I wanted to have a simple solution. You can see the solution working here in this <span class=\"caps\">GIF</span>:</p>

<p>The transparent part of the <span class=\"caps\">PNG</span> will be what should not trigger the rollover, and all other pixels should.</p>
<p>The JavaScript is pretty simple and based on the principles <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/06/building-a-simple-paint-game-with-html5-canvas-and-vanilla-javascript/\">used in the letterpaint game I just explained</a> on Mozilla Hacks.</p>
<p></p><ul><li>Loop over all images with the class “rollover”</li><li>Add a mouseover, mouseout and mousemove event to each</li><li>On mouseover, take the image and copy it to an invisible Canvas element</li><li>On mousemove, find out the x and y position of the mouse cursor and read the colour of the pixel at this position from the canvas</li><li>If the pixel has an opacity of 0, it is transparent, which means remove the “over” class from the image.</li><li>If the pixel is not opaque, add the class “over” to the image.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>You can <a href=\"http://codepo8.github.io/irregular-shape-rollover/\">try this out here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/codepo8/irregular-shape-rollover/\">source code is on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This seems to be a very simple way to have irregular shaped rollovers. You could enhance the hover() function to also react differently depending of which part of the shape you are on. You can also add touch handlers easily. The only caveat is that the images and the JavaScript need to be on the same domain or the canvas is not allowed to access the pixels of the image.</p>

<p>We’ve handled a large spike in interest from people wanting to participate in the project after the <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/contribute\">Get Involved</a> page was featured in promotions about Mozilla’s 15th anniversary.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.arewegrowingyet.com\"><img alt=\"inquiry_spike4\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3298\" height=\"161\" src=\"http://davidwboswell.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/inquiry_spike4.png?w=450&h=161\" width=\"450\" /></a></p>
<p>To handle this increase in interest, we’re encouraging teams to try new things and are seeing encouraging results—for instance, Mozilla Hispano has been <a href=\"http://www.nukeador.com/14/04/2013/community-workflow-reboot-to-task-centric-approach/\">rethinking how they connect with new volunteers</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve also been looking at tools to help deal with larger numbers of potential contributors.  A <a href=\"https://etherpad.mozilla.org/cbt-working-group-systems-data\">Systems and Data Working Group</a> has been formed to identify community building functionality priorities and evaluate systems to meet those needs.</p>

<p>Once people start participating, we are looking into the best ways to recognize them.  Dia from the People team has worked with a university to let a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Recognition#School_Credit\">student get credit for their contributions</a> and she’s turned this into a template other teams are excited about using.</p>

<p>I’ve also really enjoyed helping with a project to <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2013/04/15/help-us-build-a-history-of-mozilla-told-by-mozillians/\">collect stories of Mozilla’s history</a>.

<p>So an hour and a half later I had created <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/scriptlet/\">Scriptlet for Firefox</a>.</p>
<h3>Scriptlets</h3>
<p>A Scriptlet is a new add-on type that is the combination of a button and a bookmarklet, and it can re-use any existing bookmarklet.</p>
<p>Typically I find that I lose my bookmarklets because they get lost in my mountain of bookmarks, so I never use them, even tho there are some useful ones out there, and they are extremely easy to make.</p>
<p>Scriptlets are much easier, for starters they are completely separated from bookmarks, but they also include toolbar buttons which can be moved to any part of the user interface that I want. This means that Scriptlets can be moved to the add-on bar, the navigation bar, toolbars, and lots of other places!</p>
<h4>How To Install Scriptlets</h4>
<p>In order to install a Scriptlet, right-click on a bookmarklet, and click the ‘Make Scriptlet’ button. Once this is done you find the Script in the <a>add-on manager</a></p>
<img src=\"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/102/102740.png?modified=1370896696\" />
<h4>Scriptlets Provide Toolbar Buttons</h4>
<p>Once you make a Scriptlet a toolbar button will be automatically added to your navigation bar (aka navbar). See the top right of your browser.</p>
<img src=\"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/102/102742.png?modified=1370896696\" />
<h4>Scriptlets Are Add-ons</h4>
<p>Because Scriptlets are treated as first class add-ons they can be managed in Firefox’s Add-on Manager. This will be where you enable/disable, or uninstall a Scriptlet.</p>
<img src=\"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/102/102746.png?modified=1370896696\" />
<h4>New Features For Scriptlets</h4>
<p>One idea I’m thinking about is making the button a togglable button, this way Scriptlets will be automatically added to pages that you visit after the page loads. This will come after the SDK team launches the new UX modules near the end of Q2 whcih is coming soon.</p>

My <a href=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2013/06/08/at-adacamp-this-weekend-reception-plotting-for-the-imposter-syndrome-workshop/\">first post in this series</a> was about the opening reception.</p>
<h3>Allies Workshop</h3>
<p>I started the day with the 2 hour <a href=\"http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Allies_workshop\">Allies workshop</a>. Valerie Aurora led this session, with the intention to train a number of new people on how to give the workshop. I took a ton of notes, so here goes, without much editing:</p>
<p>The presentation starts with 15 minutes of introductory slides, which are Creative Commons licensed. We answer the question “why is men fighting sexism important?” There’s a visualization at the start of the number of women involved in FOSS (not many – 2%) and Wikipedia (slightly more, but still not many). We got sidetracked on a slide that had a bit of jargon on it – introducing the idea that we don’t have a gender binary, but for the purposes of the discussion today, “man” will mean “cis white male”, as that’s typically who will be participating in the allies workshop.</p>
<p>I failed to take notes on this (probably because I was intensely paying attention!).. There was a part about the <em>purpose</em> of speaking up. When you decide to speak up about sexism, you’re often not doing so to educate someone who has made a mistake, or is being a jerk. You’re helping a group set a boundary and showing everyone listening in what is ok and not ok. Super important point for me!</p>
<p>There’s a reminder to not be scared of the discussions about to happen. They will be uncomfortable possibly awkward, and that’s ok. When men speak out about sexism they do not get the same responses that women do. They are often publicly supported and privately criticized — the opposite of what happens to many women. The workshops will be a 7-minute discussions, followed by summaries and reflections to the group. These discussions are the times to ask questions, even seemingly foolish questions. Val asks that everyone respond authentically (my word, not hers) when questions are asked. This is a safe place for Allies to find the answers to difficult problems.</p>
<p>Then we went into some example scenarios. We did three scenarios that were prebaked and then one that a participant brought up. I’ll save my notes on these discussions for another time. I really enjoyed the time I spent on this, and learned quite a bit from my group.</p>
<h3>The Likeability Paradox</h3>
<p>In the book Lean In, there’s a section about the difficulty of being liked vs being respected when you are a woman leader. This discussion was by far the best large-group of the day for me, and extremely well-moderated. I wrote down lots of phrases: bossy, “risk theater”, damning with faint praise, competition between women == disdain, acceptable level of emotional discourse, the difference between “earning respect” and “earning like”, likeabliity == emotional catering, gendered insecurity about a woman’s place, the amount of time it takes to earn respect vs first impression likeability, orgs maximize stability by ignoring these kinds of problems.</p>
<p>There was the start of a great discussion about dog whistle adjectives, adverbs and verbs that subtly and not-so-subtly remind women of their role and place. Are there words we can choose to describe “aggressive” behavior, for example, that are less gendered and more fair to both men and women? Example was asking an employee to “be more aggressive”, when what the manager really meant was they wanted more “decisiveness”. Another person said they started using “inspire” instead of “convince” in their activist work.</p>
<p>There was a short discussion asking “what is respectibility” and how do we unpack that term. This brought up some experiences people have had with being questioned consistently about their qualifications — “the veracity of contribution is questioned” and “what has ‘this woman’ ever done for this community?” Another comment was that by speaking less as a manager, and “planting seeds that employees then run with and come to the same conclusion” a woman had found it much easier to get her employees to do what she wanted. There was quite a bit of discussion about how problematic recommending “speak less” is, even if it is an effective tactic. Upon reflection, I think what was problematic was the framing, rather than the management tactic. Men who are managers clearly use this tactic as well, and it is effective.</p>
<p>Later, Sumana tweeted a link to this <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=281B5C89-EC5A-42B5-939F-B279164C567A\">piece in Politico about Jill Abramson</a>.</p>
<h3>Depression and activism</h3>
<p>I mostly came to this session for tips from those in attendance. Here’s what I wrote down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask for a big chunk of time off to recharge </li>
<li>Structure time for fun </li>
<li>Only work when you really want to — give yourself permission to relax when you feel like crap! </li>
<li>Consider flipping your “alarm” system to management – start talking about how busy you are when you’re at 70% capacity, rather than 150%! </li>
<li>Be selfish with your time and energy</li>
</ul>
<p>Internal strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try cognitive behavioral therapy (there are great books: Mind over mood, Panic attack)</li>
<li>Flip negative self talk, going even so far as to rewrite personal stories in the best possible light</li>
</ul>

<p>I stopped by Heroku before heading to the reception, to meet up with @<a href=\"http://twitter.com/cathynalee\">cathynalee</a> and see my buddies at Heroku Postgres. After a round of a hilarious card game where you fight rounds to the death (with dice of course) with strange heros (mine was a Barbarian) and acquire coins to win, I headed off to the Google SF offices for our reception.</p>
<p>I’d never been to the space before. The view was pretty great.</p>

<p>Many, many old friends were there. Having the opportunity to sit and mingle and be silly for a couple hours was great for calming me down, and wonderfully restorative to be able to just relax with friends I work on so many difficult problems with, week after week. I also saw several friends from Portland, who I don’t see often enough at home. I ran into Sarah Sharp, who <a href=\"http://sarah.thesharps.us/2013/05/23/%EF%BB%BF%EF%BB%BFopw-update/\">gave me the stats on her work</a> with the Gnome Outreach Program for Women and the Linux Kernel. In short: In 13 days, 374 patches were submitted, and 137 patches were accepted. Six women were accepted into this round of OPW. Fantastic work on the part of the Linux Kernel contributors and all the women who applied.</p>
<p>I also got to mingle with hackerspace founders from Seattle and San Francisco. I’m just a supporter of hackerspaces, rather than a founder, so I felt a little bit like a fangirl joining their conversations. I also met the creator of <a href=\"http://users.humboldt.edu/mstephens/hate/hate_map.html\">Hate Map</a>, a sentiment analysis heat mapping tool.</p>
<p>And, I met a fellow coworker from Mozilla for the first time and we chatted about PyLadies, PyStar and grassroots education efforts for adult, beginner programmers. And then another woman joined us and we veered off and talked about Texas, how insane the advisory system is in high schools that steer women away from tech and science classes “to keep balance” in the girls lives (!!??!?!) and learning to drive as an adult.</p>
<p>As the party wound down, I met with some organizers of an imposter syndrome workshop. My advice to women who feel like they’re frauds: pick some badass skill to acquire and spend a couple days mastering the basics. For me, my eyes were opened to the power of badassness and the confidence that it inspires when we taught PyLadies how to use git. Several of the women who have taken these classes have come back to me with stories of impressing their coworkers, getting jobs and overall just feeling like they belonged in tech circles and discussions because they could confidently talk about git workflows.</p>
<p>Overall, great conversations and I’m looking forward to more amazing ones over the next two days.</p>" nil nil "23a0e05ddfa59c142803cff2e8f0ae2d") (13 (20928 8795 669786) "http://mykzilla.blogspot.com/2013/06/64-bit-linux-adb-for-simulator.html" "Myk Melez: 64-bit Linux ADB for Simulator" "Myk Melez" "Fri, 07 Jun 2013 23:04:04 +0000" "Thanks to the efforts of new Mozilla intern <a href=\"https://github.com/bkase\">Brandon Kase</a>, the <a href=\"https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/r2d2b2g/r2d2b2g-linux.xpi\">latest        preview build of Firefox OS Simulator for Linux</a> includes a     64-bit version of ADB, so you can push an app to an FxOS device from     64-bit Linux installations without any extra packages!<br />     <br />     Building it was tricky, because the Android SDK build scripts don't     support that target. Brandon first tried simply specifying the     target, which worked on an older version of ADB (1.0.24).

And its <a href=\"http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/raring/android-tools\">source       package</a>'s build system is much simpler than the SDK's. We just     needed a binary that works on distributions with older versions of     glibc than Raring's 2.17.

<p>I’ve been a bit quieter on this blog recently. There’s two reasons for that. The first is that I started a new, additional blog at <a href=\"http://literaci.es/\">http://literaci.es</a>.</p>
<p>But there’s another reason: we’re reasonably close to a beta release for Mozilla’s new, open learning standard for Web Literacy. </p>
<p>By ‘we’ I mean the close to 50 people who have joined us at various points since February; they’ve helped <a href=\"http://carlacasilli.wordpress.com/\">Carla</a> and me think through the many (and sometimes quite thorny) issues involved. The Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit, community-focused organisation: we <em>need</em> contributions from poeple like those who have volunteered their time and effort so far!</p>
<p><strong>We’re aiming to launching the beta on July 26th.</strong> There’s a number of things that need to happen before then that are internal – things like graphic design, press releases and the like. But <em>you</em> can help, too! Here’s how.</p>

<p>We’ve already got a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard/CompetencyGrid\">competency grid</a> (that’s in need of some Design TLC). Right now, though, we’re working on the skills underpinning those competencies. We also need at least a couple of examples of those skills.</p>

<p>It was a great honor for me to be invited to give the opening keynote. This was a rare opportunity to outline some of the industry-changing RelEng-at-scale work being done at Mozilla. It also allowed me to describe some very important non-technical tactics that we used to turnaround Mozilla’s situation from “company-<strong>threatening</strong>-and-human-<strong>burnout</strong>” to “company-<strong>enabling</strong>-and-human-<strong>sustainable</strong>“. All stuff that is applicable to other software companies. Presenting the first session at the first RelEng conference helped set the tone for the event, so being down-to-earth and practical felt important. </p>
<p>My presentation focused on how effective RelEng helped Mozilla compete against larger, better funded, companies. This is what I mean by “Release Engineering as a Force Multiplier”. To give some perspective of scale, I showed:</p>
<ul>
<li>company logos scaled by <strong>headcount</strong> for each of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla. I noted that using revenue/profits instead of headcount would be just as disproportionately out of scale.<br />

<li>Release Engineering is important to the success of every software project. Writing a popular v1.0 product is just the first step. If you want to retain your initial users by shipping v1.0.1 fixes, or grow your user base by shipping new v2.0 features to your existing users, you need a reproducible pipeline for accurately delivering software. Smaller projects may not have someone with formal RelEng title, but there’s always someone doing RelEng work. Otherwise, your product, and your organization, will not survive.
</li><li>Building an effective RelEng pipeline requires a different mindset to writing a great software product. Both are non-trivial, and understanding this difference in mindset enables you to hire wisely.
</li><li>The importance of Release Engineering for the sustainability of a software company is only beginning to be recognized. Release Engineering is not taught as a discipline in any CompSci course that I know of. This has the unfortunate side effect that most Release Engineers only learn on-the-job, usually as a side-effect of helping out during an organizational emergency. This limits the effectiveness of Release Engineering to what can be learned on the job, and because information isn’t widely shared, its hard to learn from other people’s mistakes or successes. By contrast, when I was studying CompSci for my undergrad and postgrad degrees, there were all sorts of course modules, books and published papers detailing which sorting algorithm was best suited for which types of data, which graphics algorithms were best suited for which types of images, etc… but nothing about Release Engineering. Nothing about how to build a pipeline to deliver that software to users… even though every software company lives-or-dies by the efficiency of their delivery-pipeline.

<p>This conference was a great start to helping raise the understanding of the industry on these three points, and many more. </p>
<p>Big hat-tip to the organizers (Bram, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christianbird\">Christian</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniqueThor\">Foutse</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kmoir\">Kim</a>) – they did an awesome job putting together a unique and special event. Other industry speakers included Google, LinkedIn, MicrosoftResearch, Netflix, PuppetLabs as well as a wide range of academic speakers – see <a href=\"http://releng.polymtl.ca/program.html\">full program details here</a> and <a href=\"http://relengofthenerds.blogspot.ca/2013/05/releng-2013-keynotes-john-oduinn.html\">here</a>. In the past, I’ve attended plenty of industry conferences which have a sales-touch to them (“our technology is great, you should buy our stuff” or “our technology is great, you should come work here”), or academic conferences which have academic-accuracy-but-can-lack-urgent-practicality. By contrast, this conference was very different. All the speakers spoke candidly, humbly and objectively about the technology and tactical successes that worked for them at their companies, and equally candidly about their failures as “teaching moments” for everyone to learn from. The level of raw honestly by all these speakers, from all these different companies and academia was super-honest and very collaborative.  Additionally, the sheer volume, and the quality, of attendees blew everyone away… the discussions during breaks were just electric. Very very refreshing. I dont know if this magic was because of the carefully chosen mix of industry-vs-academia speakers, or if this was because the organizers were also a mix of industry and academia, but regardless – the end result was simply fantastic.</p>
<p>There’s already plans underway to have this RelEngConference again next year… if you build software delivery pipelines for your company, or if you work in a software company that has software delivery needs, I recommend you follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/relengcon\">@relengcon</a> and plan on attending next year.

It works really well, and comparing to the previous system it is both smaller and more convenient to use (not mentioning that <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2011/06/rsa-finally-comes-clean-securid-is-compromised/\">the previous system has been compromised</a>).</p>
<p>The only problem I had with it is, that in order to be ultra-secure it doesn't allow much configuration (my version of Yubikey doesn't have <code>use-numeric-keypad</code> option) so with my default Czech keyboard, it didn't work, and I had to switch all the time between Czech and US keyboard manually.</p>
<p>The first option seemed to be to use custom configuration snippet as described in the Fedora Wiki and create a file in <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/</code> directory with content like:</p>
<pre>Section \"InputClass\"
Identifier \"keyboard defaults\"
MatchProduct \"Yubic Yubico Yubikey II\"
Option \"XkbModel\" \"pc104\"
Option \"XkbLayout\" \"us\"
Option \"XKbOptions\" \"\"

<p>Unfortunately, this solution doesn’t work with Gnome, which controls input devices dynamically and overrides Xorg defaults.</p>

When the example script from <code>gnome-settings-daemon</code> is modified to include the configuration, it could also set Yubikey (and only Yubikey) input device to us keyboard layout.

automated system that executes Python test scripts on real
user hardware, that is, actual phones. It’s been an active project for about
a year now, and we’ve learned a lot about the difficulties
of performing automated performance measurements on hardware that was never
intended for automation. I’m documenting this story for posterity, since it
has been an interesting, if often frustrating, experience. If you want to
follow along, the source is <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/autophone/\">on github</a>.</p>
<p>I’m going to divide this into a few posts to hopefully avoid tl;driness and to
ensure I actually finish at least some of this.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>For correctness testing, Mozilla’s Fennec automation is largely done with
development boards, specifically Tegras and Pandas. These boards have
wired power and ethernet, perfect for rack mounting, and all of a given
type generally behave the same.</p>
<p>These boards are not, of course, consumer devices, and,
despite having similar chipsets as real phones, they have different
performance characteristics. To really see how Fennec performs in the real
world, we need to measure Fennec on devices that people are buying and using every day. Thus
was born the Autophone project.</p>
<h3>Devices</h3>
<p>At the moment, the existing Autophone production system runs tests on kind-of-to-very “old” phones. This isn’t a limitation of Autophone; rather, it’s a
sampling of phones that were still very common last year, when the project
got truly underway. We will add newer phones as time progresses, especially
now that the system is very stable. The current system has at least one of
the following phones:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTC Google Nexus One</li>
<li>LG Revolution</li>
<li>Motorola Droid Pro</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy SII</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy SIII</li>
<li>Samsung Google Nexus S</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a few more phones waiting to be deployed in a second cluster.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>A brief discussion of Autophone’s design may help in  understanding the
problems in automation and performance measurements by providing some context.</p>
<p>Autophone consists of a main Python process with one worker process per phone.
We used processes instead of threads to isolate certain failures from other
workers. The main process has separate threads for its TCP command
server and for a <a href=\"http://pulse.mozilla.org\">pulse</a> listener.</p>
<p>The worker processes are each tied to a single device and are responsible
for controlling that device. The devices all have the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/SUTAgent\">SUTAgent</a> and Watcher
installed, to which the processes talk via <a href=\"https://mozbase.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozdevice.html\">mozdevice</a>. A worker is spawned
when the main process receives a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/SUTAgent#Registration_Server\">SUT registration</a> message on its command
port from an unknown device. Device info is cached in a JSON file, and
workers are also launched upon startup for any known device.</p>
<p>The workers each listen to their own queue, which receives commands from the
main process. Commands come from users, via the command server, or are
triggered by a build notification from pulse. The workers also check for
jobs every 10 seconds (see below).</p>
<p>Autophone also includes a simple build cache server. This server handles
requests for builds from the workers, fetching them via ftp as necessary,
ensuring that only one copy of a particular build is downloaded at the same
time, and that recently used builds are kept around, subject to space
restrictions. (This part is actually very common to our automation frameworks,
so it really should be extracted and put into its own module. Even better would
be to extend <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/mozdownload/\">mozdownload</a> to support Fennec and have the build cache server
use that to fetch builds. But I digress.)</p>
<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>When a build notification is received from pulse, or when a user issues
a “triggerjobs” command, for each device an entry containing the build URL and device name is inserted into a sqlite database. A generic “job”
command is then issued to each worker. As mentioned above, the workers
poll this database every 10 seconds. They also poll the database immediately after
executing a command, so the “job” command serves merely to trigger a poll of the database. This mechanism allows for worker processes
to be restarted, since even if a “job” command is missed, the job itself
will be picked up from the database. Along a similar vein, if the whole
system is shut down, the current test will be restarted, and any queued
tests will remain.</p>
<p>When a job successfully completes, the associated entry for that device and
build is deleted from the jobs database. The number of attempts for each job is also recorded, and a job is abandoned after too many attempts, in case there are
unrecoverable problems with a particular build or build/device combination.</p>
<p>Tests themselves are Python classes specified in a <a href=\"https://mozbase.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manifestdestiny.html#manifestdestiny-create-and-manage-test-manifests\">ManifestDestiny</a> manifest
file. They are (for better or for worse) executed in the worker process,
i.e., not as a (further) separate process. Test classes are derived from a base
class, PhoneTest, and are pretty much free form, requiring only a runjob()
method that takes a dict of build metadata and the worker subprocess object,
which can be used to manipulate the device as necessary, in particular to
attempt to recover a frozen/disappeared device (though this part should probably be
split into its own object, since a test shouldn’t be messing with the worker process
object). The PhoneTest base class also provides some
convenience functions to push profiles, start fennec, and report status
messages to the main process.</p>
<p>At the moment, we have a single active test, S1S2, which measures Fennec
startup performance. We also have support
for a few unit tests (crashtests, reftests, JS reftests, mochitests, and
robocop), though these are currently disabled pending some stability fixes.</p>
<p>Next post I’ll discuss the goal of S1S2, its challenges, and our solutions.</p>" nil nil "f898abd79baf034a4cffe836b08e4086") (5 (20928 8795 651083) "http://sriramramani.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/ellip-sis/" "Sriram Ramasubramanian: =?utf-8?Q?Ellip=E2=80=A6sis?=" "Sriram Ramani" "Fri, 07 Jun 2013 00:07:29 +0000" "<p>In the dub-dub-dub browser world, there’s a lot of need for the dot-dot-dot. The pages titles are exponentially long, to make sure Google indexes them, and they don’t fit properly on a small screen. For e.g., CNN shows a very long title that cannot be shown comfortably in a <code>ListView</code>‘s row. Firefox used to show ellipsis and truncate the text in such cases. However, there are a couple of problems: An ellipsis in the middle cuts the text off in such a way that the context is lost; an end ellipsis is not good from a design point of view. To mitigate this problem, we wanted a <code>TextView</code> that fades in the end. (Design philosophy: Show a small path, and leave the imagination to the viewer).</p>
<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_304\" style=\"width: 235px;\"><a href=\"http://sriramramani.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/ellip-sis/faded-text-view/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-304\"><img alt=\"A TextView that fades if there is more text to show.\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-304\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://sriramramani.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/faded-text-view.png?w=225&h=400\" width=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A TextView that fades if there is more text to show.</p></div>
<p>To show a faded <code>TextView</code>, we need to know when, how and how much to fade. The amount of fading needed can be exposed as an attribute, say <code>fadeWidth</code> for the custom view. When to fade part becomes easier if we can constrain the <code>TextView</code> to a single line and see if the text runs longer than available width. The XML for such a view would look like:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">    <com.sriramramani.widget.FadedTextView android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"
android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"
android:singleLine=\"true\"
android:ellipsize=\"none\"
sirius:fadeWidth=\"30dp\"/>
</pre>
<p>Every <code>TextView</code> is backed by a <code><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/Layout.html\">Layout</a></code>, that holds the information on how to draw the text on the screen. This includes the number of lines, text in each line, the line ascent, baseline, etc. Unfortunately, the <code>getWidth()</code> on the layout returns a very huge number. Fortunately, we know that the <code>TextView</code> will have only one line. Using <code><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/Layout.html#getLineWidth%28int%29\">getLineWidth(0)</a></code>, we can find the width of the first line — the entire text.</p>
<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\">    // ... somewhere in the custom text view.
Layout layout = getLayout();
if (layout.getLineWidth(0) > getMeasuredWidth()) {
// add fading.
} else {
// don't add fading.
}
</pre>
<p>That was simple! How do we add a fading effect to the end? The <code><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/LinearGradient.html\">LinearGradient</a></code> can take a range of colors and stops, and can be added as a <code>Shader</code> to a <code>Paint</code>. Voila!</p>
<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\">    // ... somewhere in the custom text view.
float start = 0.0f;
float end = getMeasuredWidth();
// mFadeWidth is obtained from the attribute.
float stop = ((float) (end - mFadeWidth) / (float) end);
// Setup the linear gradient.
LinearGradient gradient = new LinearGradient(0, 0, end, 0,
new int[] { color, color, Color.TRANSPARENT },
new float[] { 0, stop, 1.0f }
Shader.TileMode.CLAMP);
</pre>
<p>Let’s build the entire custom view now.</p>
<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\">public class FadedTextView extends TextView {
// Width of the fade effect from end of the view.
private int mFadeWidth;
// Add other constructors too.
public FadedTextView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle) {
super(context, attrs, defStyle);
TypedArray a = context.obtainStyledAttributes(attrs, R.styleable.FadedTextView);
mFadeWidth = a.getDimensionPixelSize(R.styleable.FadedTextView_fadeWidth, 0);
a.recycle();
}
@Override
public void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
int width = getMeasuredWidth();
// Layout doesn't return a proper width for getWidth().
// Instead check the width of the first line, as we've restricted to just one line.
if (getLayout().getLineWidth(0) > width) {
// Always get the current text color before setting the gradient.
int color = getCurrentTextColor();
// [0..stop] will be current text color, [stop..1] will be the actual gradient
float stop = ((float) (width - mFadeWidth) / (float) width);
// Set up a linear gradient.
LinearGradient gradient = new LinearGradient(0, 0, width, 0,
new int[] { color, color, Color.TRANSPARENT },
new float[] { 0, stop, 1.0f },
Shader.TileMode.CLAMP);
getPaint().setShader(gradient);
} else {
getPaint().setShader(null);
}
// Do a default draw.
super.onDraw(canvas);
}
}
</pre>
<p>This doesn’t take care of compound drawables and their padding. But that’s pretty straightforward as there are methods to access their properties. And that’s how we kill the ellip…sis.</p>

You can find out more about why we're doing this and how in the <a href=\"http://rawkes.com/articles/vizicities-dev-diary-1\">first dev diary</a>.</p>
<p>In the first month we had created the beginnings of a powerful platform and had a lot to show for it. Let's take a look at what's been going on since then; we're confident that it's been worth the wait!</p>
<p><em>Aside: We're currently looking for funding options to secure the future development of ViziCities. Interested? Get in touch via <a href=\"mailto:hello@vizicities.com\">hello@vizicities.com</a>!</em></p>
<h3>Realising the potential</h3>
<p>When we released the first dev diary back in March we didn't expect much of a response, after all this was just a personal project created by two people for fun. If only we knew back then what we know now — it went down a storm!</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"ViziCities plinth\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-1/vizicities-plinth.jpg\" title=\"\" />ViziCities plinth</figure><p></p>
<p>What has become clear to us is that this project is much more than a personal experiment. We're beginning to realise the huge potential of ViziCities, specifically around the power of visualising large quantities of data on a 3D, living city.</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"ViziCities SSAO demo\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-1/vizicities-combined-ssao.jpg\" title=\"\" />ViziCities SSAO demo</figure><p></p>
<p>It's also clear to us that other people are extremely excited about the project and want to get involved and help us succeed. We totally didn't expect this and have been humbled by the response so far.</p>
<p>We've obviously hit on something important and we're keen to make sure it happens!</p>
<h3>Exciting discussions with third parties</h3>
<p>Since the last update we've been talking with a number of third parties who we'd like to work with to help make ViziCities better. These third parties range from important individuals, to Fortune 500 companies, to open source initiatives, all the way to large government organisations.</p>
<p>We've been blown away by the response when we show these guys our progress. It's also shown us is that there is clearly huge amount of interest for the project and its future potential as a data visualisation platform. In short, we're confident we're onto a winner.</p>
<p>I won't go into too much detail just yet, but here are a few examples of the kind of people we've been meeting with in the past few weeks:</p>
<h4>Ordnance Survey</h4>
<p>The national mapping agency for Great Britain. If you live in the UK then you've likely used an Ordnance Survey map or service.</p>

<p></p><figure><img alt=\"View from the TfL offices\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/tfl.jpg\" title=\"\" />View from the TfL offices</figure><p></p>
<h4>Data.gov.uk</h4>
<p>The curators of the UK's primary open data store.</p>
<h4>And many more!</h4>
<p>We've been talking to <em>a lot</em> of people since the last update, these have been just a few of them. We're keen to talk to more people so get in touch via <a href=\"mailto:hello@vizicities.com\">hello@vizicities.com</a> and we'd love to work something out.</p>
<h3>Talking at events about our progress and experience</h3>
<p>One of the most exciting non-development things that happened recently was the opportunity to talk about ViziCities at the Front-Trends conference in Poland. It was great fun and the community was superb!</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"Pete (right) and I (left) at Front-Trends\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/front-trends.jpg\" title=\"\" />Pete (right) and I (left) at Front-Trends</figure><p></p>
<p>During the talk we covered a little about the history of the project, as well as some of the development issues we encountered, and perhaps even a little secret demo at the end. You'll have to watch the video (below) and find out for yourself…</p>
<p></p><figure></figure><p></p>
<p>We've got a bunch more talks in the pipeline and can't wait to show more people what we've been up to. The project is changing week on week and so we always have something new and exciting to talk about.</p>
<p>Please get in touch via <a href=\"mailto:hello@vizicities.com\">hello@vizicities.com</a> if you think we'd fit in with your event, it's likely we'd love to come talk.</p>
<h3>Awesome new features</h3>
<p>We've been alluding to some very exciting features for a while now, and we're finally ready to show you some of them!</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"Secret ViziCities feature\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-1/vizicities-future.jpg\" title=\"\" />Secret ViziCities feature</figure><p></p>
<h4> Leap Motion</h4>
<p>Not long after the last update we soon realised that there was huge potential for us to utilise the <a href=\"http://leapmotion.com\">Leap Motion</a> as a new way of interacting with the 3D visualisation (think Minority Report). What we didn't expect was Leap Motion reaching out to us and sending a dev kit to experiment with!</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"Pete and I demoing the Leap Motion support at Front-Trends\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/leap-motion.jpg\" title=\"\" />Pete and I demoing the Leap Motion support at Front-Trends</figure><p></p>
<p>It's early days and we haven't put too much time into integration yet, but check out this video for a cool demo of what we managed to cobble together in half an hour:</p>
<p></p><figure></figure><p></p>
<p>All in all, we're massively impressed with the Leap Motion (it's so accurate!) and reckon we can make some really intuitive interactions for people using the device.</p>
<h4>Live data</h4>
<p>Live data is something Pete and I are keen to explore in depth for ViziCities. One of the later experiments has been to visualise live tweets within the 3D city environment, which ended up looking really cool!</p>
<p><em>Aside: Twitter visualisations are <a href=\"http://tweetmap.it\">something close to Pete and I</a>, we love them.</em></p>
<p>We haven't finished this yet but we're aiming to make the tweets float out of the city similar to the way a balloon floats out of a child's hand and into the sky. Here's a little video of our current progress (the tweets are real):</p>
<p></p><figure></figure><p></p>
<p>The eagle-eyed amongst you will notice that there aren't many tweets appearing, considering London uses Twitter so much. There are 2 reasons for this; the first is that we recorded this video early on a Friday morning, the second is that we only have access to Twitter's 1% real-time stream so in reality there are many, many more tweets.</p>
<p>And now for the feature we've been the most excited about…</p>
<h4>London Underground in 3D and real-time</h4>
<p>Ever since we started the project we've wanted to visualise public transport in real-time and 3D. Why? Partly because it'll look amazing, but mostly because this is exactly the kind of thing that will help bring cities to life.</p>
<p>We decided that our first challenge was to build the London Underground network in 3D, with the aim to then place real-time trains along the 3D tracks. This was something we'd not seen before — anywhere — and definitely not something seen on the Web. Crazy? We thought so too, but it was worth a try.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we had a head-start thanks to <a href=\"http://traintimes.org.uk/map/tube/\">Matthew Somerville's live (2D) tube map</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/businessandpartners/syndication/\">the TfL APIs</a>. However, the 3D aspect introduced a whole world of complexity to the challenge (eg. how deep are the stations?), but we were prepared to take it on!</p>
<h5>We succeeded</h5>
<p>We'll save the break-down of how we implemented it for another post (we learnt a lot) but it's safe to say that we got it working and it looks beautiful. Oh, and you see those icons above the tube lines? Those are trains. Real trains. Moving in real-time. In 3D…</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"Close-up of the London Underground\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/underground-1.jpg\" title=\"\" />Close-up of the London Underground</figure><p></p>
<p>What you can see here is the result of many hours of work from Pete and I, ranging from programming time, to nearly giving up trying to understand the algorithms involved, to hours spent manually wrestling with Excel spreadsheets containing the data we needed. Let's just say that the world would be a better place if data was offered in a variety of similar, usable formats.</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"The London Underground\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/underground-2.jpg\" title=\"\" />The London Underground</figure><p></p>
<p>The result, if we do say so ourselves, is amazing. We can't actually believe that we did it! The cherry on top is that the London Underground in 3D looks just as good as we'd hoped.</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"An overview of the London Underground network\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/underground-3.jpg\" title=\"\" />An overview of the London Underground network</figure><p></p>
<p>We still have a way to go but we certainly have the beginnings of a live public transport 3D visualisation platform, at least for London. From here we hope to move onto busses and other aspects of the network in London.</p>
<p></p><figure><img alt=\"Adding UI interactions for live trains\" src=\"http://rawkes.com/media/vizicities-dev-diary-2/underground-4.jpg\" title=\"\" />Adding UI interactions for live trains</figure><p></p>
<p>Static screenshots are so boring, so here's a video showing off our latest and greatest feature. We hope you enjoy it as much as we have!</p>
<p></p><figure></figure><p></p>
<p>Want to talk to us about this? Get in touch via <a href=\"mailto:hello@vizicities.com\">hello@vizicities.com</a> and we'll spill as many beans as we can.</p>
<h4>And much more!</h4>
<p>While the London Underground in 3D is clearly the most exciting feature to date, we've also been working on many others. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ambient sound via the Web Audio API</li>
<li>Better AI (video below)</li>
<li>Implementing UI and interaction</li>
</ul>
<p></p><figure></figure><p></p>
<p>Rest assured, there is much more left to do. We've only just touched the surface of what's possible with the platform!</p>
<h3>Help fund the future of ViziCities</h3>
<p>With that in mind, we need your help. To continue working on ViziCities and ensure it's future success we need to start working on it full time and really give it the attention it deserves. To do that we need to live, and to live we need to earn money.</p>
<p>I'll keep this brief, we're now actively looking to explore financing options to fund future development. Particularly in the early stages, we're keen to explore being sponsored by like-minded organisations who also want to see a platform like ViziCities happen and succeed.</p>
<p>Know anyone who would be interested to support the future of the project? Get in touch via <a href=\"mailto:hello@vizicities.com\">hello@vizicities.com</a> and we'll get right back!</p>
<p>We've been blown away by your response so far. We're making this happen and we'd love to have you as a part of it!</p><div class=\"feedflare\">

(China, India, Argentina, Israel!)<br /><br />RTT is the hidden driver in so much of internet performance and to whatever extent possible it needs to be quashed. Its so much more than time to first byte.<br /><br />Bandwidth, CPU, even our ability to milk more data out of radio spectrum, all improve much more rapidly than RTT can.<br /><br />Making  RTT better is really a physical problem and is, in the general case at least,  really really hard. Making things less reliant on RTT is a software  problem and is a more normal kind of hard. Or at least it seems if you're a software developer.<br /><br />RTT is not just time to  the first byte of a web request. It's DNS. Its the TCP handshake. Its the  SSL handshake. Its the time it takes to do a CORS check before an XHR. Its the time it  takes to grow the congestion window (i.e. how fast you speed up from slow start) or confirm revocation status of the SSL certificate. Its the time it takes to do an HTTP redirect. And it is the time you're stalled while you recover from a packet loss. They're all some  factor of RTT.<br /><br />HTTP/2 and SPDY take the first step of dealing with this by creating a prioritized and muxxed protocol which tends to make it more often bandwidth bound than HTTP/1 is. But even that protocol still has lots of hidden RTT scaling algorithms in it.<br /><br /><br />" nil nil "685cd5ccee9e09d9e2a73f53143ee54d") (2 (20928 8795 647197) "http://monica-at-mozilla.blogspot.com/2013/05/blushproof.html" "Monica Chew: Blushproof" "Monica Chew" "Thu, 06 Jun 2013 17:16:20 +0000" "<h4>Personal embarrassment, Firefox, and you.</h4>Have you ever been personally embarrassed because your friends or housemates found out something about your browsing history?

<p>The Platform meeting has been in limbo for some time. Since taking the helm in February, I found it difficult to answer questions like: What is the purpose of this meeting? Who is the target audience? Why do we meet each week? After discussions in the meeting and on the Mozilla <a href=\"https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-platform\">dev-platform mailing list</a>, this week I made a mostly wholesale change and rebooted the meeting.</p>
<h3>The Engineering Meeting</h3>
<p>The name “Platform Meeting” is a holdover from the meeting’s origins. This meeting has long included updates from non platform teams such as the desktop front-end, mobile front-end, and stability teams. More recently, the meeting added updates from Firefox OS and Firefox Metro. This is really an engineering wide meeting so let’s call it the “Engineering Meeting”.</p>
<h3>Meeting Purpose</h3>
<p>One of my goals with this reboot was to be able to clearly articulate what this meeting was about. My working definition of the meeting’s purpose is:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Engineering meeting is a weekly time to discuss the work of engineering teams and share information relevant to the day-to-day work of engineers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Meeting Agenda</h3>
<p>I restructured the meeting agenda around the meeting purpose. The meeting now focuses on engineering teams and the relevant information from engineering support teams. I have also asked each person responsible for an agenda item to update the wiki the day before the meeting so as to have a set agenda before the meeting starts.</p>
<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Agenda</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Actions</strong><br /> Action items from previous meetings.</li>
<li><strong>Hot Bugs<br /> </strong>Orange Factor, Stability, and other high priority bugs that are currently unowned or require help to make progress.</li>
<li><strong>The Need To Know<br /> </strong>Release related notices and schedule and upcoming system outages and upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>Key Issues<br /> </strong>Bigger topics and non team specific issues that are of interest to Engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Team Stand-ups<br /> </strong>A short (<2 min) update from each engineering team. No questions during the updates!</li>
<li><strong>Quality Programs<br /> </strong>An opportunity to hear about relevant updates from our Critsmash, Memshrink, Orange Factor, and Stability initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Roundtable<br /> </strong>All other issues and any questions that come up over the course of the meeting.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Meeting Time</h3>
<p>The meeting time remains unchanged. The Engineering Meeting is held Tuesdays, at 11am PT. Details about joining this public meeting are <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/#Meetings\">available on wikimo</a>.</p>
<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>
<p>One of the requests that came from the dev-platform discussion was for improved meeting notes. I would like to know whether the changes that have been made to the meeting agenda have resulted in an improvement to the notes. If you read the notes, I would appreciate your input. Please comment on this post, post to dev-platform, or e-mail me privately. For your reference, here’s a link to <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/2013-06-04\">this week’s notes</a>.</p>
<h3>Feedback From the First Meeting</h3>
<p>The feedback after the first meeting was very positive. Here’s a sample from IRC:</p>
<blockquote><p>“congrats on drastically improving this meeting (IMHO) I am feeling greatly optimistic about mozilla all of a sudden”<br /> – Brad Lassey (<a href=\"http://irclog.gr/#show/irc.mozilla.org/planning/27639\">ref</a>)</p>
<p>“this is the change we needed”<br /> – Doug Turner (<a href=\"http://irclog.gr/#show/irc.mozilla.org/planning/27642\">ref</a>)</p>
<p>“yeah i think i’m going to start coming to these regularly again”<br /> – Jesse Ruderman (<a href=\"http://irclog.gr/#show/irc.mozilla.org/planning/27643\">ref</a>)</p>
<p>“this is exactly what I wanted to get out of this meeting”<br /> – Daniel Veditz (<a href=\"http://irclog.gr/#show/irc.mozilla.org/planning/27645\">ref</a>)</p>
<p>“this meeting was very useful to me, learned several interesting things”<br /> – Gavin Sharp (<a href=\"http://irclog.gr/#show/irc.mozilla.org/planning/27646\">ref</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>A Work In Progress</h3>
<p>I consider the Engineering Meeting a work in progress. This meeting should continue to evolve to meet the needs of our engineering teams. Have an idea to improve the meeting? Please post to dev-platform or get in touch with me privately.</p>
