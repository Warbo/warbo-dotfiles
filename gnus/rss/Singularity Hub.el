<p>Cardiovascular disease is the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs317/en/\">most common</a> cause of death worldwide, and doctors have struggled to find effective treatments. Heart failure, an especially dire form of illness in which the organ ceases to pump adequately, affects <a href=\"http://www.medicographia.com/2012/02/the-heart-failure-epidemic/\">roughly 26 million</a> people worldwide. Many don’t respond to medication and are left waiting for transplants. But donor hearts are so scarce that just <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/429816-overview\">one percent</a> of patients who need heart transplants get them.</p>
<p>A growing number of researchers are looking to alleviate the problem by building hearts, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2011/12/16/latest-victory-for-regenerative-medicine-pituitary-grown-from-embryonic-stem-cells/\">like other organs</a>, from biological tissue. Such hearts have the added benefit of using the patient’s own tissue, reducing the <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/06/girl-receives-engineered-trachea-treated-with-her-own-stem-cells/\">chance of rejection</a>.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh medical school have made a significant breakthrough on this front, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/130813/ncomms3307/full/ncomms3307.html\">reported</a> earlier this month in Nature Communications: They created a heart that <a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Movie-4.mov\">beat</a> on its own (video).</p>

<p>“Scientists have been looking to regenerative medicine and tissue engineering approaches to find new solutions for this important problem. The ability to replace a piece of tissue damaged by a heart attack, or perhaps an entire organ, could be very helpful for these patients,” <a href=\"http://www.upmc.com/media/NewsReleases/2013/Pages/pitt-project-shows-mouse-heart-beats-after-regeneration.aspx\">said</a> Lei Yang, the lead researcher.</p>
<p>The researchers took a mouse heart from which everything had been removed but the basic structure and laid onto it cardiovascular cells developed from human induced stem cells. The human cells specialized into endothelial (or lining) cells, smooth muscle cells and muscle contractile cells. The resulting heart beat on its own and responded to medications.</p>
<p>Previous efforts to grow a heart in the laboratory had used <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluripotency\">pluripotent stem cells</a>, but Yang’s experiment added an additional step. Researchers let the stem cells begin to develop for six days and then transferred just the cardiovascular progenitor cells to the heart scaffolding. That meant that none of the cells that grew on the scaffolding developed into liver cells, for example.</p>
<p>The greater stock of functional heart cells gave the heart enough power to beat. Using only cells that have already begun to specialize as cardiovascular cells also reduces the chances that tumors will develop in the bioengineered organ, Yang told Singularity Hub.</p>
<p>Still, the mouse-sized heart did not beat with the strength or synchronization that would be necessary to support a living organism. Researchers have yet to hit upon a way to grow cells as thick and densely packed in the laboratory as they are in the human body, a significant challenge facing regenerative medicine.</p>
<p>“Other scientists are using this technology to regenerate the <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/07/28/functional-3d-human-liver-buds-made-from-stem-cells-in-mice/\">liver</a>, the lung. The heart probably is going to be a difficult organ — those other organs, they’re not beating. We have a beating rate; the beating rate is controlled by the cardio-conduction system. It’s really hard to regenerate a whole conduction system,” Yang said.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bioartificial-heart-ed.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-66018\" alt=\"bioartificial-heart-ed\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bioartificial-heart-ed.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>The stem cells in the experiment were “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell\">induced</a>,” or made, from adult connective tissue — a procedure that would make it possible to use a patient’s own tissue to build a heart. The patient’s immune system wouldn’t, therefore, identify the tissue as foreign and attack it.</p>
<p>However, the structural scaffolding for such bioartificial hearts can’t come from live patients. The next move for Yang and his colleagues will be to use as a scaffolding a stripped-down heart from a human cadaver available for research. Even covered with the hypothetical patient’s own cells, such a heart could possibly be rejected.</p>
<p>Still, given the magnitude of heart disease and the scarcity of donor hearts, many are hopefully eying the progress toward a bioartificial heart.</p>

<p>Printed in bold, no-nonsense lettering <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/behind-the-cover-babies/\">across the cover</a>, a recent issue of <i>National Geographic </i>proclaimed, “This Baby Will Live to Be 120.” No question mark. The notion that impending medical discoveries may add years to our lives, with wits and vitality largely intact, is gaining credence and mainstream attention.</p>
<p>But if research delivers radical life extension, would humans undergo medical treatments to attain it? In a <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/\">Pew Research poll</a>, 56% of those surveyed said no. That surprised me. I had assumed vastly more people would opt for a few more years of quality time with loved ones, to see what wonders the future holds, or to finish lifelong works.</p>
<p>At first, I thought maybe the result could be explained by financial insecurity, general dissatisfaction, and quality of life worries. And I was wrong. 80% of those polled were satisfied with life and worried about financing retirement only a little or not at all. (Whether they aren’t worried but should be is a question for their financial advisor.) Meanwhile, 84% believed life would be better or the same in ten years.</p>
<p>Next, I guessed religious beliefs could be the culprit. Many believe humans should not play god. And anyway, if you expect to go to a better place after you die, why stick around here longer than you have to? Wrong again.</p>
<p>The poll broke the results down by major US religious groups and found 60% to 67% (varying by group) believed medical advances prolonging life are a good thing. That result is more or less in line with the public at large (63%). A number of experts and religious leaders <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/religious-leaders-views-on-radical-life-extension/\">weighed in</a> on the topic, and responses were neutral or supportive.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-164_1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65841 alignright\" alt=\"SH 164_#1\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-164_1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Few objected to having more elderly folks around in general. Almost 90% said more people over 65 was either a good thing or wouldn’t make a difference. (Of course, if people do start living to 120, we’ll have to redefine “elderly.”)</p>
<p>After being dead wrong on a few of my assumptions (a good reminder), I questioned myself on the matter and was surprised to find ambivalence. After searching a little longer and a little deeper, I couldn’t find a good reason for it.</p>
<p>We already undergo medical treatments to prolong life, from vaccines, to drugs, to surgery. While we don’t know exactly what these radical life extending “medical treatments” will look like—and that uncertainty may contribute to the result—at least ethically, I can’t see how they’d be any different.</p>
<p>If treatments involve, for example, a non-invasive splicing in of a genetic mutation to confer resistance to cancer, they would almost certainly be ethically superior to the agonizing treatments available now. And if less cancer, which is often (but not always) an age-related disease, resulted in longer life and less suffering—how could we say no?</p>
<p>The result appears in part to be driven by skepticism. While 70% of respondents said they believe by 2050 we’ll have cured cancer and prosthetic limbs will be <i>better</i> than ordinary arms and legs, 73% said they didn’t believe the average person would live to at least 120 by the same year.</p>
<p>Just 24% of respondents said they have “a lot” of confidence new medical treatments are thoroughly vetted before becoming publicly available. 79% think everyone should have access to such treatments, but almost two-thirds think only the wealthy will be able to afford them. Two-thirds think top-heavy demographics would strain natural resources, and 58% of respondents believe such treatments would be unnatural.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-164_2-BIG-2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65858 alignleft\" alt=\"SH 164_#2 BIG 2\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-164_2-BIG-2.jpg\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" /></a>Despite these reservations and worries, the finding may be muddied by uncertainty in the face of a new and unfamiliar topic. Only 7% of those surveyed said they were well versed on the subject, 38% knew a little, and 54% hadn’t heard of radical life extension.</p>
<p>So, if we can push the boundaries of human life (and health) to 120 or more—should we?</p>
<p>While some may advocate acceptance of a “natural” death or worry about resources, I imagine such arguments will fade somewhat as various technologies come online, are proven safe and effective, and become cheaper and more common. Cultural norms tend to evolve between generations, not within them.</p>
<p>But what about beyond merely adding a few years to the human experience? What of those who would do away with death entirely? Admitting that such a technology is nowhere in sight, it’s a fascinating thought experiment.</p>
<p>Philosopher Todd May <a href=\"http://www.believermag.com/exclusives/?read=interview_may\">thinks the anticipation of death</a> gives life meaning and color. Mortality motivates us to create works great and small and to examine and improve our lives. As Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, prior to becoming Pope Benedict XVI, <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/religious-leaders-views-on-radical-life-extension/\">put it</a>, “Disposing of death is in reality the most radical way of disposing of life.”</p>
<p>That death robs us of the beauty its anticipation brings forth may be the price of a full, vital life. The piper must be paid—entropy prevails. And anyway, through the lonely, long haul of eternity, immortality may prove a sentence worse than death itself.</p>
<p>But life extension isn’t immortality, and it doesn’t dispose of death. It’s the gift of more time and less suffering. May <a href=\"http://www.believermag.com/exclusives/?read=interview_may\">says</a>, “ Life is short, and if death were to be a good thing, it would be a better thing much further down the road than it is for human lives now.”</p>

<p>You’ve probably read it before. The cost to launch stuff into orbit is <i>astronomical</i>. Cliché, but true. Rockets are seriously complicated and costly machines—yet, they’re currently used once and thrown away.</p>
<p>According to SpaceX’s Elon Musk, $200,000 in fuel and oxygen make up just 0.35% of his firm’s launch costs. The rest is in their $56.5 million <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/falcon9\">Falcon 9</a> rocket. (Which, by the way, is one of the cheapest around.) He compares traditional launch methods to throwing away a $300 million 747 after a one way flight—no one would fly.</p>
<p>To be a multi-planetary species, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B5av0BOajU\">Musk believes</a> we have to develop fully reusable rockets. If every rocket launched 1,000 times, instead of just once, capital costs would plummet from $50 million to $50,000 per launch (not counting operational expenses) and could drive per pound launch costs down 100-fold.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the firm is hard at work on a prototype. They call it Grasshopper.</p>
<p>Instead of being left to burn up in the atmosphere, rockets like Grasshopper will initiate a powered descent and vertical landing. In its latest aerobatics, the 10-story Grasshopper rose 820 feet and flew 328 feet to the side, then reversed course to a pinpoint landing on the launch pad. <a href=\"http://moonandback.com/2013/03/10/musks-space-talk-wows-crowd-at-south-by-southwest/\">Musk says</a> the rocket lands as accurately as a helicopter—and the latest video backs up that boast.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/HXdjxPY2j_0?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Grasshopper’s <a href=\"http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/falcon9v1-1.html\">first flight</a> was back in September, 2012. The rocket has flown seven successful missions since last year, the highest reaching over a thousand feet. The latest flight was the first to demonstrate dynamic maneuverability.</p>
<p>Upcoming flights of the Falcon 9R rocket (SpaceX’s next generation Falcon) will <a href=\"https://www.newspacewatch.com/articles/spacex-moving-quickly-towards-fly-back-first-stage.html\">attempt to recover</a> the first stage at sea. After disengaging from the second stage, the first stage will fire its engine to reorient before reentry and then light up again above the ocean to demonstrate slowing capability. Musk has emphasized they fully expect the maneuver will take a few iterations to perfect.</p>
<p>Perhaps as early as mid-2014, SpaceX will attempt to bring a Falcon 9R first stage back for a vertical landing on the launch pad. Further down the road, the firm plans to incorporate similar systems into both stages of the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon space capsule.</p>
<p>These future rockets will not only defray capital costs but also enable fast turnaround. <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/rockets/elon-musk-on-spacexs-reusable-rocket-plans-6653023\">Musk told</a> <em>Popular Mechanics</em>, ”Multiple flights per day for first stage and side boosters. At least one flight per day for the upper stage.” And at a flight per day, he said per pound costs could drop to somewhere in the vicinity of $100.</p>
<p>All that said, it’s still quite a hop from Grasshopper to a fully reusable suite of space vehicles. Reusable rockets <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIVCCaYWGpk\">have been explored</a> and discarded as a viable option in the past. A few generations of very smart people have worked hard to streamline rockets to maximize payload to orbit. Reusability requires you strengthen each stage, add thermal protection, include a landing gear. That’s a lot of added weight.</p>
<p>Musk admits, “We could fail. I’m not saying we’re certain of success here. But we are going to try to do it.” It’s a giant risk but an equally significant gain if they succeed. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sumVEEAZ_w\">Musk says</a>,  “If humanity’s ever to expand beyond Earth and establish a self-sustaining base on another planet, it’s critical that we solve this problem.”</p>

<p>At any given moment, the sun bathes the earth in <a href=\"http://energy.gov/articles/top-6-things-you-didnt-know-about-solar-energy\">enough solar energy</a> to meet its power needs 10,000 times over. The challenge lies in capturing and converting that energy into usable electricity. And, for the time being, an international tangle of politics and prices also complicates matters.</p>
<p>Solar power represents a tiny fraction of the total power used globally, but its use has been growing exponentially in recent years. That trend continued in 2012, according to recently released analyses from the <a href=\"http://www.seia.org/research-resources/irec-releases-2012-us-solar-industry-overview\">Interstate Renewable Energy Council</a> and <a href=\"http://www.earth-policy.org/indicators/C47/solar_power_2013\">Earth Policy Institute</a>.</p>
<p>In the United States, solar energy installations increased by 80 percent in 2012, gaining roughly 3.3 gigawatts of capacity. Utilities have added much of the new capacity, showing mainstream buy-in to the cleaner energy source.</p>
<p>Globally, solar power grew by roughly half in 2012, as 31 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic power were installed. More capacity was added than in any previous year, and total gigawatts exceeded 100 for the first time.</p>
<p>Falling prices on solar equipment, which represent most of the cost of solar projects, have driven adoption. The average cost of a completed PV system dropped by more than 25 percent in 2012; since the beginning of 2011, prices have fallen by more than half.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/world-cumulative-solar-pv-installations-epia.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-65745\" alt=\"world-cumulative-solar-pv-installations-epia\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/world-cumulative-solar-pv-installations-epia.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"247\" /></a>Falling prices and <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/09/24/surging-solar-in-2011-proof-of-ray-kurzweils-bold-prediction/\">exponential growth curves</a> suggest that solar power may eventually compete with traditional fossil fuel energy sources. But in the short term, governments could push prices back up as they roll back subsidies and tack on tariffs.</p>
<p>Germany, the country with more solar power than any other, has built its solar arsenal thanks, largely, to tax incentives. (It’s a small arsenal: Even the world solar leader gets just 5 percent of its power from the sun, according to Earth Policy Institute.) Italy has similar incentives. Yet both countries are rolling the subsidies back, which could slow the rate of solar adoption in Europe.</p>
<p>The “made in China” issue has been the biggest political struggle over solar power in recent years. China — which now makes 60 percent of all photovoltaic, or PV, equipment — has extended generous state help to its manufacturers, leading them to offer a glut of low-priced equipment on the international market.</p>
<p>Both Europe and the United States have accused China of “dumping,” as their manufacturers have struggled to compete.</p>
<p>“The PV space is getting better, but the reason has a little to do with technology but a lot more to do with the giant factories in China. They’re building at an unprecedented scale,” Gregg Marinyak, Singularity University’s chairman of energy and environmental systems, told Singularity Hub.</p>
<p>According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, “The sharp fall in prices, due in part to a global oversupply, has put a serious strain on solar manufacturers worldwide.”</p>
<p>PV equipment production did indeed shrink, by 2 percent, for the first time ever in 2012. Still, the dip in manufacturing won’t last in the face of continued demand for solar, according to EPI.</p>
<p>But U.S. manufacturers have been vocal about what they see as unfair competition from China. Lower prices are good for consumers, but if they dip down too close to production costs, they make homegrown manufacturers unhappy.</p>
<p>In May, the U.S. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/business/energy-environment/us-slaps-tariffs-on-chinese-solar-panels.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&\">imposed</a> tariffs on Chinese solar panels, bumping up the price U.S. consumers pay. (Europe also required China to charge higher prices for solar panels it sells there.) In response, the Chinese subsequently <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a82b8294-ef9b-11e2-8229-00144feabdc0.html\">imposed tariffs</a> on imports of U.S. polysilicon, an ingredient in the dominant commercial type of photovoltaic modules, crystalline silicon.</p>
<p>The tariffs could, at least in the short term, slow the U.S.’s move to cleaner energy, according to Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.</p>
<p>“It will make solar panels more expensive to anybody who wants to install them here. I mean, as a policy to slow down renewable energy, this is great,” Hufbauer said in a podcast.</p>

<p>But solar power is a rapidly changing industry, and industry players continue striving to make their products cheaper and better in order to drive widespread adoption.</p>
<p>“These are short term effects,” Marinyak said of the price wars. “And there are some technical things that could really, really help the adoption of large-scale solar.”</p>
<p>For example, solar thermal energy setups, which use the heat rather than the light of the sun to produce energy, are gaining traction in the United States and Spain. And any improvements to how utilities can store energy for later use would dramatically sweeten the pot for the major players to use more solar power.</p>

<p>To wit, two recent grads of the U.S. Air Force Academy have patented a drone that climbs into a building through its water or sewage pipes. The inventors, Kyle Fitle and David Carte, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/13/drones-dont-just-fly-heres-one-that-crawls-inside-sewer-pipes/\">described</a> the vehicle to the Washington Post as a way to facilitate communication between first responders and people trapped in damaged buildings in the wake of a natural disaster or explosion.</p>

<p>The motorized remote-controlled device, humbly named the Pipe Snake, consists of a rod that ejects diagonally backward a pair of arms with ends designed to grip to the wet sides of the pipe, locking in forward motion. The Pipe Snake then propels its central rod through the arms, retracts them, and starts the process again. It can move vertically up a pipe and navigate an elbow curve.</p>
<p>Fitle and Carte said future automated versions of the Pipe Snake will be able to transport small payloads, such as bandages and medications. But of course the upstream-swimming drone could also be used to deliver more than just human kindness: It could transport surveillance devices or small explosives.</p>

They’ve applied for a patent on something called an Adhesive Pellet Projectile (at left), an empty cone-shaped projectile that can hold infrared and audio sensors and sticks to a variety of surfaces. Fitle and Carte hope to use the devices together so that, for example, the Pipe Snake could transmit via a router carried by the Pellet if it loses contact with receptors held by first responders.</p>
<p>Drones and robots can perform an ever-growing number of tasks for people.

<p>As our human footprint on the planet grows heavier, our activities may have complex and unforeseen effects in far reaching places like the oceans.</p>
<p>In one ongoing instance, the number of bottlenose dolphins beaching themselves along the Mid-Atlantic coast has skyrocketed this summer. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has declared an “unusual mortality event,” launching an investigation into what might be causing the deaths.</p>
<p>Since July roughly 70 <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2011/06/22/researchers-to-use-a-high-tech-translator-to-converse-with-dolphins/\">dolphins</a> stranded themselves on Virginia beaches. In previous years, the state has seen less than a dozen dolphin strandings during the summer months. New Jersey, which sees even fewer strandings in a typical July, was the site of 20 dolphin deaths last month. More than the usual number of dolphins have also beached this summer in New York, Delaware and Maryland, according to the NOAA. All told, nearly 150 dolphins have died.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/stranded_dolphin_in_nj-ed.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-65575\" alt=\"stranded dolphin\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/stranded_dolphin_in_nj-ed.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>The stakes of the episode are high because the deaths are reminiscent of a 1987-88 die-off that claimed nearly 800 bottlenose dolphins from the same Mid-Atlantic population. That episode, which caused the same mid-Atlantic dolphin population currently affected to be labeled “depleted,” ultimately prompted Congress to create the unusual mortality event protocol that was invoked on August 8.</p>
<p>“The timing of it all on the 25th anniversary, with the same species at the same time of year in the same geographical area has people really alarmed,” Trevor Spradlin, a marine mammal biologist with the NOAA’s Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program, told Singularity Hub.</p>
<p>Marine mammals, and bottlenose dolphins in particular, have paid a high price for human industrialization. The dolphins — Flipper’s species — are among the <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/health/mmume/\">most frequent victims</a> of unusual mortality events. Die-off events appear to have increased globally since the late 1980s, in some cases spurred by disease or by toxins produced by algae that flourish in polluted waters.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/12/07/you-know-the-robot-invasion-is-getting-real-when-mine-sniffing-dolphins-start-losing-their-jobs/\">On the west coast</a>, bottlenose dolphins have been among the marine mammal species likely impacted by the Navy’s use of sonar. In the Gulf of Mexico, the animals were seriously affected by the <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/06/09/underwater-drones-from-irobot-helping-monitor-gulf-oil-spill/\">Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> of 2010. (According to an NOAA report, “Coastal dolphins have been observed with tar balls attached to them and seen swimming through oil slicks close to shore and inland bays.”) On the east coast, the dolphins frequently get snagged in <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/01/31/our-singularity-future-overfished-bluefin-tuna-sells-for-record-1-76-million/\">fishing nets</a>, according to the NOAA.</p>

A virus may be behind the current die-off, as well.</p>
<p>“Based on the rapid increase in strandings over the last two weeks and the geographic extent of these mortalities, an infectious pathogen is at the top of the list of potential causes for this unusual mortality event, but all potential causes of these mortalities will be evaluated,” an NOAA statement <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/health/mmume/midatldolphins2013.html\">said</a>.</p>
<p>Preliminary testing suggests that one of the beached dolphins was infected with the morbillivirus, which can cause skin lesions and pneumonia. Several animals also presented with evidence of pneumonia.</p>
<p>“Anything like that is going to be a red flag,” said Spradlin. “We want people to be aware that if this is going to be a repeat of 25 years ago, it could have very serious implications for that stock of dolphins.”</p>
<p>The morbillivirus was only identified in dolphins and other cetaceans in the late 1980s. Researchers don’t know if it is spread or exacerbated by human activity — for instance, if certain types of pollution might lower the dolphins’ immune response, leaving them more susceptible to the virus. Morbillivirus could also simply hit upon particularly lethal variants from time to time, like the flu.</p>
<p>Tissue samples collected from the dead animals must be analyzed before researchers can say with any certainty that the deaths are attributable to a virus, or whether bacteria or chemical pollutants or even acoustic trauma may be to blame, Spradlin said.</p>
<p>“As we find out more information about the cause or causes, we can try to implement particular measures to quiet it down, hopefully. But if it’s Mother Nature there may be little we can do,” said Spradlin.</p>
<p>The NOAA will post any updates on its investigation into the bottlenose dolphin deaths <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/health/mmume/midatldolphins2013.html\">on its website</a>.</p>

<p>Elon Musk has long been hinting at a high-speed form of transportation enigmatically named the Hyperloop. Earlier this summer, he promised to reveal his Hyperloop plans in August. After a round of media hype and an all-nighter with his engineers at SpaceX and Tesla Motors, Musk recently posted the 57-page <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/hyperloop_alpha-20130812.pdf\">Hyperloop Alpha</a> plan online.</p>
<p>The man isn’t known for moderation, and the Hyperloop isn’t exactly conservative. Though he says the plan is based on existing technology, the cost and design are so far on paper only. There are no proposals to build a prototype or scale it up.</p>
<p>What is the Hyperloop? After rampant speculation, we now have a very detailed vision. The Alpha plan calls for two 350+ mile tubes (one in each direction) placed side-by-side and elevated on concrete pylons. Linear electric motors accelerate a 28-passenger pod up to 760 mph and give boosts at 70-mile intervals along the way.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-167_1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65607 alignright\" alt=\"SH 167_#1\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-167_1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>At high subsonic speeds, the pods face significant resistance from the tube and air. Other proposals, like ET3, solve these problems with magnetic levitation, or maglev, and a vacuum tube.</p>
<p>But Musk says lining the tube with magnets is too expensive, and it’s incredibly difficult and costly to maintain a vacuum over hundreds of miles. (See <a href=\"http://www.et3.com/\">here</a> to learn more about ET3.)</p>
<p>His plan offers a novel way around these obstacles. First, the tube will be kept at a pressure equivalent to flying at 150,000 feet. This low-pressure environment is easier to maintain than a vacuum but still minimizes air resistance.</p>
<p>To further mitigate drag, each pod will carry an electric compressor fan up front to pass 60% of the air through a rear exhaust. Musk says the fans are like “a pump at the head of syringe actively relieving pressure.” The rest of the air will be directed into perforated skis that levitate the vehicle (the reverse of a puck on an air hockey table).</p>
<p>The pods will be pressurized, and in the event of a loss of pressure, oxygen masks will drop down. Due to the trip’s short duration, in an emergency, passengers will alert the station but otherwise continue along to their destination. The time to help will likely be less than in an aircraft—which requires rerouting, clearing runways, and taxi time.</p>
<p>Inside each pod, passengers sit in form fitting seats with personal entertainment systems mounted overhead. Initially, they’ll feel acceleration equivalent to liftoff in a commercial jet, and thanks to controlled banking in the tube (think bobsled) and variable speed, the sharpest bends will exert only light forces on folks.</p>
<p>To avoid significant curves and the cost of buying land, the Hyperloop tube follows the relatively straight path of interstate highway I-5. Solar panels will line the top of the tube and provide not only enough energy to run the Hyperloop, but potentially more. The support pylons will be equipped with dampers to help them adapt as the land settles, the structure flexes with temperature changes, or during an earthquake.</p>
<p>The Hyperloop will send travelers from San Francisco to Los Angeles in about half the time (35 minutes) and at a fraction of the cost ($20 one way) of current or proposed alternatives. Musk estimates the Hyperloop’s 40 pods could shuttle 7.4 million people each way every year, and the system could be expanded to include more stations.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-167_3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65610\" alt=\"SH 167_#3\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-167_3.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"302\" /></a></p>
<p>Although the plans are very detailed, and Musk and his cadre of engineers are some of the brightest in the world, there’s plenty of room to be skeptical. Musk knows they haven’t thought of everything (eg., an onboard bathroom), so he wants to flesh out the plans in an open source environment. Ideas are welcome.</p>
<p>But, of course, plans are paper. The Hyperloop won’t gain much traction outside the media without a real world, proof-of-concept prototype. Although Musk was initially reticent to take the project on—recently noting he may have made a mistake talking about it and that his plate is full at SpaceX and Tesla—he now says he’s considering working up at least a prototype.</p>
<p>Musk’s stated goal is to improve on California’s $68 billion high speed rail project, an undertaking he says will be one of the slowest and most expensive per mile. But are we to believe his Hyperloop cost estimate of $6 billion? That number would be more realistic if Musk himself built the Hyperloop. But if it’s up to the state? Forget about it. Cost overruns are inevitable.</p>
<p>That said, even at five times the estimated budget, the project would be half the cost of  high speed rail. And at 10 times the budget, or a cost equivalent to high speed rail, we’re still talking massive improvements on speed, travel time, and ticket cost. (And that’s if high-speed rail hits <em>its</em> stated budget—which it won’t.)</p>
<p>But forget about all the practicalities for a moment. The Hyperloop has inspired a debate about what’s possible beyond bureaucratic group-think. There are other proposals out there, but no one of Musk’s stature is standing up and backing them.</p>
<p>I don’t subscribe to the Peter Thiel school of thought that we haven’t accomplished anything of note recently. The information age enables folks to Tweet their breakfast <i>and</i> research, propose, and develop radical cancer diagnostics—as Jack Andraka <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/25/16-year-old-jack-andraka-invents-innovative-cancer-test-using-google-search/\">recently demonstrated</a> at age 16. Open information is enabling faster innovation.</p>
<p>That said, it’s valid to note that some technologies, like transportation, have been stuck in neutral since the 70s or earlier. And that’s where big thinking from the likes of Musk is more than welcome. If the guy building rockets at a fraction of traditional costs says we can do better than a moderately improved 19<sup>th</sup> century technology—maybe we can.</p>

<p>So why are drones such a big deal? In our robotic future, anything that can reduce urban congestion, minimize carbon emissions, save money and save trips to the emergency room (car accidents kill, you know) will drive huge value in the economy and make our lives better, to boot.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/on4DRTUvst0?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Pizza is just the start. Drones are perfect delivery vehicles for just about anything that fit in a small box or a shopping bag. Interestingly, this describes perfectly what a host of startups are attempting to do right now with people’s cars (TaskRabbit), bike messengers (PostMate), and local delivery vehicles (InstantCart, AmazonFresh). Drones are better than any of those options for a significant portion of delivery orders.</p>
<p>Here’s why. Drones are efficient, small, flexible, and not bound by gravity (unlike, say, automated cars). They can be operated remotely. They have a small carbon footprint (particularly the electrically powered drones). They do not cause wear and tear on public infrastructure. Unlike cars and bikes, the bill of materials for drones relies significantly less on large masses of raw materials and more on the always attractive economics of computing and Moore’s Law. In other words, drones will get cheaper and cheaper, and at a much faster rate than cars or bikes.</p>
<p>Are commercial drone flights unsafe? That depends on the driver and the regulations. Humans driving drones without proper training would certainly constitute a real hazard. But including autopilot capabilities to allow programmable flight paths not reliant on human skills might solve a lot of these issues. (In fact, I believe that in the next decade consensus will grow that humans should probably let computers do all the piloting – something <a href=\"http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/world/Experts+look+pilot+error+Asiana+crash+evidence+mechanical/8649065/story.html\">the recent Asiana crash in San Francisco hammered home</a>). Such a move, also, would confine drone traffic to specific avenues, minimizing chaos.</p>
<p>This doesn’t solve questions around collision management, altitude regulations, air rights, and potential privacy violations. (As in, a drone buzzing a hotel room for surveillance is uncool). But all of those except the privacy violations are technology questions that can be solved. Mandating altitude governors in commercially approved drones could keep drones flying in specific bands. No fly zones could be electronically enforced with geofences around airports, military bases, and political establishments, as an example.</p>
<p>Personally, I am waiting for a drone-based delivery service that mirrors what Lyft has done with cars and allows hobbyists to “volunteer” to deliver products. I imagine the reaction will be swift and Draconian. But we need some sort of push to get government moving towards incorporating drones into transportation plans.</p>
<p>Rarely do you get a win-win-win-win solution. Drones could do the job cheaper, giving people back more time to do what they want (rather than drive to the store), reduce wear and tear on our stressed cities and suburbs, and reduce pollution. Hopefully, the guys at the FAA also dream of Pizza Drones and would enjoy getting that half-gallon of milk delivered to their doorstep (or apartment balcony) within an hour or less. I certainly would.</p>

Hill" "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 15:53:59 +0000" "<p>Sci-fi films have a long history of speculating what the future might be like, seeking to understand what remnants of humanity will continue on when the world may undergo drastic change. More realistic projections focus on <a href=\"http://www.singularity.com/\">a pivotal period in the future, known as the Singularity</a>, when technological growth will be so rapid and impact the world so deeply that human life will be transformed irreversibly. By definition, it’s difficult to envision what that will look like, but how will things look right on the cusp of that key time in human history?</p>
<p>That question is at the heart of <a href=\"http://www.is-movie.com/\">a feature film in production called <em>I’s</em></a>. The film begins as the first artificial intelligence “wakes up”, and it follows a bike messenger named Mason Turk who must make a critical, personal choice in the face of the last days of “civilization as we know it.”  Currently in post-production, writer/director Chris Edgette <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1851180436/is-a-feature-film-set-on-the-threshold-of-infinity/posts\">recently launched a Kickstarter campaign</a> to raise funds to take some of the technical aspects of the film to the next level. Via email, Chris provided some further insight into what those funds will accomplish.</p>
<p>First, here’s the trailer to the film:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/70843143\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>First hearing about the technological singularity some 15 years ago, Chris was blown away. He realized that “it seems highly likely that we will be able to realize greater-than-human intelligence.” He added, “The bit that really rocked my world, though, was the understanding that we really cannot know what a super-intelligence could or would do.”</p>
<p>Setting out to make a film that dealt with these subjects presented its own challenges. ”We try to respect the scientific ideas of the singularity,” he wrote, “even though many of them could not be overtly communicated in the film.”</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What struck me about the singularity, though, was that the process of rapid escalation provides a mirror for us all. If we create a singularity that wipes away our reality entirely, have we won or have we lost, as a civilization, as a species? If it simply disappears, do we continue as before? Those last days, if one knew they were happening, would be both glorious and melancholy. We would stand on the threshold of the potential death of our civilization or its epic rebirth, with no way to see the outcome. We could console ourselves with the knowledge that we had at least birthed something entirely new to our corner of the universe, something with knowledge and understanding beyond our dreams. With that, there would be the somber understanding that we had displaced ourselves from the top of the intelligence heap on Earth.</em></p>
<p><em>How will we feel when we, the toolmakers, have invented the tool that can out-invent us? These questions drove the project.</em></p>
<p><em>The film does not view the singularity as something bad or good; the characters actually express a spectrum of views on what is about to take place. The reflection itself, however, is interesting fodder for a small independent film. When faced with a terminal illness, we wonder about what we have done in life: Was it enough? Was it right? What really did we do with our time? The singularity provides the same moment of reflection for our civilization in the last days.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>You can also hear from the actors about the subject of the film in the video produced as part of the crowdfunding pitch:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zsxegsm_hjM?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign set out to provide the final polish to the film and raise the production value. Thanks to over a hundred backers, the project’s goal of raising $18,500 was met. Chris announced in an update that a first screening for the film was now scheduled for mid-October thanks to the efforts of the backers.</p>
<p>Now with just a few days left in the campaign, Chris has set a stretch goal of $25,000, which is slated to go toward improving the “the quality and interactivity of the augmented reality interfaces, allowing us to further explore the inner mind of the AI character.”  Extra funds received beyond the project’s initial target will also improve the color timing to further professionalize the look of the film and the depth to the sound and music. All the funds are going to the film production, as Chris admitted that “There is no fat; I am entirely unpaid and the associate producer is now working for a percentage of the film returns.”</p>
<p>Hollywood continues to churn out views of the future that are critical of technology and paint bleak, inhumane futures for its protagonists to struggle within, often with artificial intelligence depicted as a destroyer of humanity, whether metaphorically or physically. Chris underscored what makes this film unique in that regard: “We visualize the inside of an AI mind in a unique way…[and it] is not judged. For dramatic purposes, the AI begins as somewhat of a menace, but as the film ends, we realize that it is a being simply trying to do what we have done: create something greater.”</p>
<p>But would facing the imminent Singularity provide a different view of life in the not-so-distant future?</p>
<p>Chris commented that “I really wanted to walk the line [between a techno-optimistic and techno-pessimistic view]. I did not want to rule on whether the technological singularity would be good or bad in a traditional sense….we also wanted to include both technological and anti-technological perspectives. The technological aspect is slightly amplified by the film’s augmented reality, which isolates people as it connects them. An ecotopic commune provides the technological counterpoint, a point for deeper connection, and a place for the main character’s decision about what to do with his remaining time.  We tried not to idealize or criticize either space, but simply to reflect the oddity and range of human existence.”</p>
<p>The Kickstarter ends on Aug 16. If you’d like to contribute to the film, <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1851180436/is-a-feature-film-set-on-the-threshold-of-infinity/posts\">you can head over to the site and make a donation</a>.</p>

<p>Engineering is often <a href=\"http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/photos/7-amazing-examples-of-biomimicry/copying-mother-nature\">inspired by nature</a>—the hooks in velcro or dermal denticles in sharkskin swimsuits. Then there’s Darpa’s <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/DSO/Programs/Systems_of_Neuromorphic_Adaptive_Plastic_Scalable_Electronics_%28SYNAPSE%29.aspx\">SyNAPSE</a> project. Not content with current computer architecture, SyNAPSE is building a new kind of computer based on the brain.</p>
<p>Last year, scientists working on SyNAPSE announced they’d <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-11/world%E2%80%99s-fastest-supercomputer-simulates-100-trillion-synapses-many-human-brain\">simulated 100 trillion synapses</a> from a monkey brain on Sequoia, one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. Now, instead of simply writing brain-inspired algorithms for traditional systems,  <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/neurosynaptic-chips.shtml\">they’ve invented</a> an entirely new “neuromorphic” chip, True North, and an accompanying programming language to build applications on it.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/J69EJxUr8mw?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>IBM’s Dharmendra S. Modha, who heads up SyNAPSE, <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/517876/ibm-scientists-show-blueprints-for-brain-like-computing/\">says</a>, “It doesn’t make sense to take a programming language from the previous era and try to adapt it to a new architecture. It’s like a square peg in a round hole. You have to rethink the very notion of what programming means.”</p>
<p>The way computers currently manipulate information, shuttling it back and forth between memory and processor, is named after the early computer scientist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture\">John von Neumann</a>. Classical computing is very good at number crunching—or left-brain activities. In fact, it vastly outstrips human capabilities.</p>
<p>But the classical approach isn’t well suited for creative, adaptive intelligence. Modha thinks computers can get better at right brain activities—like learning and recognizing color, images, and faces—by taking cues from biology.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_65495\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-166_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65495 \" alt=\"SH 166_#2\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-166_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Visualization of a simulated network of neurosynaptic chips. <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/neurosynaptic-chips.shtml\">Image Credit: IBM</a></p></div>
<p>True North is built on a network of “neurosynaptic cores” that place memory, processing, and communication close to one another so they can operate in parallel, much as they do in the brain.</p>
<p>Just as von Neumann computing required a specialized programming language (Fortran), Modha says SyNAPSE’s new architecture needed the same—so his researchers wrote a new language from the ground up, and began organizing and simplifying it for future scientists and software developers.</p>
<p>Early on, programmers had to code individual neurosynaptic cores, but the language now includes 150 “corelets,” or groups of cores with similar functionality (eg., sound perception, edge detection, or color identification). Developers only need to know the general function of a corelet to integrate it into an application.</p>
<p>Beyond more fully realizing cognitive computing, SyNAPSE’s scientists hope the new chips and language will lead to computers as efficient as the brain—which <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/neurosynaptic-chips.shtml\">consumes less</a> power than a light bulb and takes up less space than a two-liter Coke.</p>
<p>That said, Modha and SyNAPSE aren’t under any illusions that they are actually recreating the brain in all its splendor.</p>
<p>“Any simulation in some sense is always a cartoon of the reality, because the reality is very complex,” Modha <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2er6jWUGDuI#at=272\">says</a>, “But just like a cartoon can capture the essence of a situation, we hope that our simulation can capture, in a very tasteful fashion, the essence of how the brain gives rise to the mind.”</p>
<p>That is, cognitive computing is to the brain what a mechanical wing is to a bird’s wing. It takes inspiration from the biological version, improving performance, but doesn’t seek to recreate every detail.</p>
<p>Eventually, Modha thinks cognitive chips will work in concert with classical chips, “We imagine a future computer which will ship with two processors. One is a classical von Neumann processor and one is a cognitive co-processor, which will be able to deal with real world environments in the way that we can.”</p>

<p>Printed in bold, no-nonsense lettering <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/behind-the-cover-babies/\">across the cover</a>, a recent issue of <i>National Geographic </i>proclaimed, “This Baby Will Live to Be 120.” No question mark. The notion that impending medical discoveries may add years to our lives, with wits and vitality largely intact, is gaining credence and mainstream attention.</p>
<p>But if research delivers radical life extension, would humans undergo medical treatments to attain it? In a <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/\">Pew Research poll</a>, 56% of those surveyed said no. That surprised me. I had assumed vastly more people would opt for a few more years of quality time with loved ones, to see what wonders the future holds, or to finish lifelong works.</p>
<p>At first, I thought maybe the result could be explained by financial insecurity, general dissatisfaction, and quality of life worries. And I was wrong. 80% of those polled were satisfied with life and worried about financing retirement only a little or not at all. (Whether they aren’t worried but should be is a question for their financial advisor.) Meanwhile, 84% believed life would be better or the same in ten years.</p>
<p>Next, I guessed religious beliefs could be the culprit. Many believe humans should not play god. And anyway, if you expect to go to a better place after you die, why stick around here longer than you have to? Wrong again.</p>
<p>The poll broke the results down by major US religious groups and found 60% to 67% (varying by group) believed medical advances prolonging life are a good thing. That result is more or less in line with the public at large (63%). A number of experts and religious leaders <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/religious-leaders-views-on-radical-life-extension/\">weighed in</a> on the topic, and responses were neutral or supportive.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-164_1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65841 alignright\" alt=\"SH 164_#1\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-164_1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Few objected to having more elderly folks around in general. Almost 90% said more people over 65 was either a good thing or wouldn’t make a difference. (Of course, if people do start living to 120, we’ll have to redefine “elderly.”)</p>
<p>After being dead wrong on a few of my assumptions (a good reminder), I questioned myself on the matter and was surprised to find ambivalence. After searching a little longer and a little deeper, I couldn’t find a good reason for it.</p>
<p>We already undergo medical treatments to prolong life, from vaccines, to drugs, to surgery. While we don’t know exactly what these radical life extending “medical treatments” will look like—and that uncertainty may contribute to the result—at least ethically, I can’t see how they’d be any different.</p>
<p>If treatments involve, for example, a non-invasive splicing in of a genetic mutation to confer resistance to cancer, they would almost certainly be ethically superior to the agonizing treatments available now. And if less cancer, which is often (but not always) an age-related disease, resulted in longer life and less suffering—how could we say no?</p>
<p>The result appears in part to be driven by skepticism. While 70% of respondents said they believe by 2050 we’ll have cured cancer and prosthetic limbs will be <i>better</i> than ordinary arms and legs, 73% said they didn’t believe the average person would live to at least 120 by the same year.</p>
<p>Just 24% of respondents said they have “a lot” of confidence new medical treatments are thoroughly vetted before becoming publicly available. 79% think everyone should have access to such treatments, but almost two-thirds think only the wealthy will be able to afford them. Two-thirds think top-heavy demographics would strain natural resources, and 58% of respondents believe such treatments would be unnatural.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-164_2-BIG-2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65858 alignleft\" alt=\"SH 164_#2 BIG 2\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-164_2-BIG-2.jpg\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" /></a>Despite these reservations and worries, the finding may be muddied by uncertainty in the face of a new and unfamiliar topic. Only 7% of those surveyed said they were well versed on the subject, 38% knew a little, and 54% hadn’t heard of radical life extension.</p>
<p>So, if we can push the boundaries of human life (and health) to 120 or more—should we?</p>
<p>While some may advocate acceptance of a “natural” death or worry about resources, I imagine such arguments will fade somewhat as various technologies come online, are proven safe and effective, and become cheaper and more common. Cultural norms tend to evolve between generations, not within them.</p>
<p>But what about beyond merely adding a few years to the human experience? What of those who would do away with death entirely? Admitting that such a technology is nowhere in sight, it’s a fascinating thought experiment.</p>
<p>Philosopher Todd May <a href=\"http://www.believermag.com/exclusives/?read=interview_may\">thinks the anticipation of death</a> gives life meaning and color. Mortality motivates us to create works great and small and to examine and improve our lives. As Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, prior to becoming Pope Benedict XVI, <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/religious-leaders-views-on-radical-life-extension/\">put it</a>, “Disposing of death is in reality the most radical way of disposing of life.”</p>
<p>That death robs us of the beauty its anticipation brings forth may be the price of a full, vital life. The piper must be paid—entropy prevails. And anyway, through the lonely, long haul of eternity, immortality may prove a sentence worse than death itself.</p>
<p>But life extension isn’t immortality, and it doesn’t dispose of death. It’s the gift of more time and less suffering.

<p>You’ve probably read it before. The cost to launch stuff into orbit is <i>astronomical</i>. Cliché, but true. Rockets are seriously complicated and costly machines—yet, they’re currently used once and thrown away.</p>
<p>According to SpaceX’s Elon Musk, $200,000 in fuel and oxygen make up just 0.35% of his firm’s launch costs. The rest is in their $56.5 million <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/falcon9\">Falcon 9</a> rocket. (Which, by the way, is one of the cheapest around.) He compares traditional launch methods to throwing away a $300 million 747 after a one way flight—no one would fly.</p>
<p>To be a multi-planetary species, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B5av0BOajU\">Musk believes</a> we have to develop fully reusable rockets. If every rocket launched 1,000 times, instead of just once, capital costs would plummet from $50 million to $50,000 per launch (not counting operational expenses) and could drive per pound launch costs down 100-fold.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the firm is hard at work on a prototype. They call it Grasshopper.</p>
<p>Instead of being left to burn up in the atmosphere, rockets like Grasshopper will initiate a powered descent and vertical landing. In its latest aerobatics, the 10-story Grasshopper rose 820 feet and flew 328 feet to the side, then reversed course to a pinpoint landing on the launch pad. <a href=\"http://moonandback.com/2013/03/10/musks-space-talk-wows-crowd-at-south-by-southwest/\">Musk says</a> the rocket lands as accurately as a helicopter—and the latest video backs up that boast.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/HXdjxPY2j_0?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Grasshopper’s <a href=\"http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/falcon9v1-1.html\">first flight</a> was back in September, 2012. The rocket has flown seven successful missions since last year, the highest reaching over a thousand feet. The latest flight was the first to demonstrate dynamic maneuverability.</p>
<p>Upcoming flights of the Falcon 9R rocket (SpaceX’s next generation Falcon) will <a href=\"https://www.newspacewatch.com/articles/spacex-moving-quickly-towards-fly-back-first-stage.html\">attempt to recover</a> the first stage at sea. After disengaging from the second stage, the first stage will fire its engine to reorient before reentry and then light up again above the ocean to demonstrate slowing capability. Musk has emphasized they fully expect the maneuver will take a few iterations to perfect.</p>
<p>Perhaps as early as mid-2014, SpaceX will attempt to bring a Falcon 9R first stage back for a vertical landing on the launch pad. Further down the road, the firm plans to incorporate similar systems into both stages of the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon space capsule.</p>
<p>These future rockets will not only defray capital costs but also enable fast turnaround. <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/rockets/elon-musk-on-spacexs-reusable-rocket-plans-6653023\">Musk told</a> <em>Popular Mechanics</em>, ”Multiple flights per day for first stage and side boosters. At least one flight per day for the upper stage.” And at a flight per day, he said per pound costs could drop to somewhere in the vicinity of $100.</p>
<p>All that said, it’s still quite a hop from Grasshopper to a fully reusable suite of space vehicles. Reusable rockets <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIVCCaYWGpk\">have been explored</a> and discarded as a viable option in the past. A few generations of very smart people have worked hard to streamline rockets to maximize payload to orbit. Reusability requires you strengthen each stage, add thermal protection, include a landing gear. That’s a lot of added weight.</p>
<p>Musk admits, “We could fail. I’m not saying we’re certain of success here. But we are going to try to do it.” It’s a giant risk but an equally significant gain if they succeed. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sumVEEAZ_w\">Musk says</a>,  “If humanity’s ever to expand beyond Earth and establish a self-sustaining base on another planet, it’s critical that we solve this problem.”</p>

<p>At any given moment, the sun bathes the earth in <a href=\"http://energy.gov/articles/top-6-things-you-didnt-know-about-solar-energy\">enough solar energy</a> to meet its power needs 10,000 times over. The challenge lies in capturing and converting that energy into usable electricity. And, for the time being, an international tangle of politics and prices also complicates matters.</p>
<p>Solar power represents a tiny fraction of the total power used globally, but its use has been growing exponentially in recent years. That trend continued in 2012, according to recently released analyses from the <a href=\"http://www.seia.org/research-resources/irec-releases-2012-us-solar-industry-overview\">Interstate Renewable Energy Council</a> and <a href=\"http://www.earth-policy.org/indicators/C47/solar_power_2013\">Earth Policy Institute</a>.</p>
<p>In the United States, solar energy installations increased by 80 percent in 2012, gaining roughly 3.3 gigawatts of capacity. Utilities have added much of the new capacity, showing mainstream buy-in to the cleaner energy source.</p>
<p>Globally, solar power grew by roughly half in 2012, as 31 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic power were installed. More capacity was added than in any previous year, and total gigawatts exceeded 100 for the first time.</p>
<p>Falling prices on solar equipment, which represent most of the cost of solar projects, have driven adoption. The average cost of a completed PV system dropped by more than 25 percent in 2012; since the beginning of 2011, prices have fallen by more than half.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/world-cumulative-solar-pv-installations-epia.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-65745\" alt=\"world-cumulative-solar-pv-installations-epia\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/world-cumulative-solar-pv-installations-epia.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"247\" /></a>Falling prices and <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/09/24/surging-solar-in-2011-proof-of-ray-kurzweils-bold-prediction/\">exponential growth curves</a> suggest that solar power may eventually compete with traditional fossil fuel energy sources. But in the short term, governments could push prices back up as they roll back subsidies and tack on tariffs.</p>
<p>Germany, the country with more solar power than any other, has built its solar arsenal thanks, largely, to tax incentives. (It’s a small arsenal: Even the world solar leader gets just 5 percent of its power from the sun, according to Earth Policy Institute.) Italy has similar incentives. Yet both countries are rolling the subsidies back, which could slow the rate of solar adoption in Europe.</p>
<p>The “made in China” issue has been the biggest political struggle over solar power in recent years. China — which now makes 60 percent of all photovoltaic, or PV, equipment — has extended generous state help to its manufacturers, leading them to offer a glut of low-priced equipment on the international market.</p>
<p>Both Europe and the United States have accused China of “dumping,” as their manufacturers have struggled to compete.</p>
<p>“The PV space is getting better, but the reason has a little to do with technology but a lot more to do with the giant factories in China. They’re building at an unprecedented scale,” Gregg Marinyak, Singularity University’s chairman of energy and environmental systems, told Singularity Hub.</p>
<p>According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, “The sharp fall in prices, due in part to a global oversupply, has put a serious strain on solar manufacturers worldwide.”</p>
<p>PV equipment production did indeed shrink, by 2 percent, for the first time ever in 2012. Still, the dip in manufacturing won’t last in the face of continued demand for solar, according to EPI.</p>
<p>But U.S. manufacturers have been vocal about what they see as unfair competition from China. Lower prices are good for consumers, but if they dip down too close to production costs, they make homegrown manufacturers unhappy.</p>
<p>In May, the U.S. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/business/energy-environment/us-slaps-tariffs-on-chinese-solar-panels.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&\">imposed</a> tariffs on Chinese solar panels, bumping up the price U.S. consumers pay. (Europe also required China to charge higher prices for solar panels it sells there.) In response, the Chinese subsequently <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a82b8294-ef9b-11e2-8229-00144feabdc0.html\">imposed tariffs</a> on imports of U.S. polysilicon, an ingredient in the dominant commercial type of photovoltaic modules, crystalline silicon.</p>
<p>The tariffs could, at least in the short term, slow the U.S.’s move to cleaner energy, according to Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.</p>
<p>“It will make solar panels more expensive to anybody who wants to install them here. I mean, as a policy to slow down renewable energy, this is great,” Hufbauer said in a podcast.</p>

<p>But solar power is a rapidly changing industry, and industry players continue striving to make their products cheaper and better in order to drive widespread adoption.</p>
<p>“These are short term effects,” Marinyak said of the price wars. “And there are some technical things that could really, really help the adoption of large-scale solar.”</p>
<p>For example, solar thermal energy setups, which use the heat rather than the light of the sun to produce energy, are gaining traction in the United States and Spain. And any improvements to how utilities can store energy for later use would dramatically sweeten the pot for the major players to use more solar power.</p>

<p>To wit, two recent grads of the U.S. Air Force Academy have patented a drone that climbs into a building through its water or sewage pipes. The inventors, Kyle Fitle and David Carte, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/13/drones-dont-just-fly-heres-one-that-crawls-inside-sewer-pipes/\">described</a> the vehicle to the Washington Post as a way to facilitate communication between first responders and people trapped in damaged buildings in the wake of a natural disaster or explosion.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pipe-snake.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65792\" alt=\"pipe-snake\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pipe-snake.gif\" width=\"606\" height=\"176\" /></a></p>
<p>The motorized remote-controlled device, humbly named the Pipe Snake, consists of a rod that ejects diagonally backward a pair of arms with ends designed to grip to the wet sides of the pipe, locking in forward motion. The Pipe Snake then propels its central rod through the arms, retracts them, and starts the process again. It can move vertically up a pipe and navigate an elbow curve.</p>
<p>Fitle and Carte said future automated versions of the Pipe Snake will be able to transport small payloads, such as bandages and medications. But of course the upstream-swimming drone could also be used to deliver more than just human kindness: It could transport surveillance devices or small explosives.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/adhesive-pellet-projectile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-65789\" alt=\"adhesive-pellet-projectile\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/adhesive-pellet-projectile.jpg\" width=\"269\" height=\"200\" /></a>Air Force engineers Fitle and Carte have worked on a series of related devices. They’ve applied for a patent on something called an Adhesive Pellet Projectile (at left), an empty cone-shaped projectile that can hold infrared and audio sensors and sticks to a variety of surfaces. Fitle and Carte hope to use the devices together so that, for example, the Pipe Snake could transmit via a router carried by the Pellet if it loses contact with receptors held by first responders.</p>
<p>Drones and robots can perform an ever-growing number of tasks for people. We tend to focus on those that are most in keeping with visions of the future dominated by <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/11/toy-size-helicopter-drones-now-on-surveillance-duty-in-afghanistan/\">Big Brother</a> or “<a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/08/13/pizza-delivery-from-the-sky-drone-delivery-networks-held-back-by-regulators/\">Blade Runner</a>.” Many applications for the technology, like the Pipe Snake, could advance that vision, but remote- and computer-powered devices also <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/28/drones-close-in-on-farms-the-next-step-in-precision-agriculture/\">support better farming</a> and help <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/06/09/underwater-drones-from-irobot-helping-monitor-gulf-oil-spill/\">clean up industrial messes</a>.</p>

<p>As our human footprint on the planet grows heavier, our activities may have complex and unforeseen effects in far reaching places like the oceans.</p>
<p>In one ongoing instance, the number of bottlenose dolphins beaching themselves along the Mid-Atlantic coast has skyrocketed this summer. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has declared an “unusual mortality event,” launching an investigation into what might be causing the deaths.</p>
<p>Since July roughly 70 <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2011/06/22/researchers-to-use-a-high-tech-translator-to-converse-with-dolphins/\">dolphins</a> stranded themselves on Virginia beaches. In previous years, the state has seen less than a dozen dolphin strandings during the summer months. New Jersey, which sees even fewer strandings in a typical July, was the site of 20 dolphin deaths last month. More than the usual number of dolphins have also beached this summer in New York, Delaware and Maryland, according to the NOAA. All told, nearly 150 dolphins have died.</p>

That episode, which caused the same mid-Atlantic dolphin population currently affected to be labeled “depleted,” ultimately prompted Congress to create the unusual mortality event protocol that was invoked on August 8.</p>
<p>“The timing of it all on the 25th anniversary, with the same species at the same time of year in the same geographical area has people really alarmed,” Trevor Spradlin, a marine mammal biologist with the NOAA’s Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program, told Singularity Hub.</p>
<p>Marine mammals, and bottlenose dolphins in particular, have paid a high price for human industrialization. The dolphins — Flipper’s species — are among the <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/health/mmume/\">most frequent victims</a> of unusual mortality events. Die-off events appear to have increased globally since the late 1980s, in some cases spurred by disease or by toxins produced by algae that flourish in polluted waters.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/12/07/you-know-the-robot-invasion-is-getting-real-when-mine-sniffing-dolphins-start-losing-their-jobs/\">On the west coast</a>, bottlenose dolphins have been among the marine mammal species likely impacted by the Navy’s use of sonar. In the Gulf of Mexico, the animals were seriously affected by the <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/06/09/underwater-drones-from-irobot-helping-monitor-gulf-oil-spill/\">Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> of 2010. (According to an NOAA report, “Coastal dolphins have been observed with tar balls attached to them and seen swimming through oil slicks close to shore and inland bays.”) On the east coast, the dolphins frequently get snagged in <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/01/31/our-singularity-future-overfished-bluefin-tuna-sells-for-record-1-76-million/\">fishing nets</a>, according to the NOAA.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/midatlantic_strandings_graph-ed.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-65576\" alt=\"midatlantic_strandings_graph-ed\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/midatlantic_strandings_graph-ed.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>The bottlenose dolphin die-off in the late 1980s was eventually attributed to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbillivirus\">morbillivirus</a>, a virus related to the one that causes the measles in humans. A virus may be behind the current die-off, as well.</p>
<p>“Based on the rapid increase in strandings over the last two weeks and the geographic extent of these mortalities, an infectious pathogen is at the top of the list of potential causes for this unusual mortality event, but all potential causes of these mortalities will be evaluated,” an NOAA statement <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/health/mmume/midatldolphins2013.html\">said</a>.</p>
<p>Preliminary testing suggests that one of the beached dolphins was infected with the morbillivirus, which can cause skin lesions and pneumonia. Several animals also presented with evidence of pneumonia.</p>
<p>“Anything like that is going to be a red flag,” said Spradlin. “We want people to be aware that if this is going to be a repeat of 25 years ago, it could have very serious implications for that stock of dolphins.”</p>
<p>The morbillivirus was only identified in dolphins and other cetaceans in the late 1980s. Researchers don’t know if it is spread or exacerbated by human activity — for instance, if certain types of pollution might lower the dolphins’ immune response, leaving them more susceptible to the virus. Morbillivirus could also simply hit upon particularly lethal variants from time to time, like the flu.</p>
<p>Tissue samples collected from the dead animals must be analyzed before researchers can say with any certainty that the deaths are attributable to a virus, or whether bacteria or chemical pollutants or even acoustic trauma may be to blame, Spradlin said.</p>
<p>“As we find out more information about the cause or causes, we can try to implement particular measures to quiet it down, hopefully. But if it’s Mother Nature there may be little we can do,” said Spradlin.</p>
<p>The NOAA will post any updates on its investigation into the bottlenose dolphin deaths <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/health/mmume/midatldolphins2013.html\">on its website</a>.</p>

Drone Distribution Networks Held Back By Regulators" "Alex Salkever" "Tue, 13 Aug 2013 17:36:57 +0000" "<p>I am waiting for my first pizza bomb but the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration just won’t get out of the way. I read about it on the Internet – an enterprising Domino’s franchisee in the U.K. who was <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2013/06/05/dominos-drone/\">experimenting using a drone copter for delivery</a> this summer. Alas, my wait in the U.S could be years if the FAA doesn’t get moving.</p>
<p>Despite a groundswell of interest in drones and numerous startups that plan to rely on drone flight, the <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/uas/uas_faq/\">FAA does not allow use</a> of drones for commercial purposes. Worse still, the FAA has provided no clear roadmap for freeing the skies to allow small unmanned vehicles to fly. Oddly, recreational use of drones remains entirely unchecked.</p>
<p>So why are drones such a big deal? In our robotic future, anything that can reduce urban congestion, minimize carbon emissions, save money and save trips to the emergency room (car accidents kill, you know) will drive huge value in the economy and make our lives better, to boot.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/on4DRTUvst0?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Pizza is just the start. Drones are perfect delivery vehicles for just about anything that fit in a small box or a shopping bag. Interestingly, this describes perfectly what a host of startups are attempting to do right now with people’s cars (TaskRabbit), bike messengers (PostMate), and local delivery vehicles (InstantCart, AmazonFresh). Drones are better than any of those options for a significant portion of delivery orders.</p>
<p>Here’s why. Drones are efficient, small, flexible, and not bound by gravity (unlike, say, automated cars). They can be operated remotely. They have a small carbon footprint (particularly the electrically powered drones). They do not cause wear and tear on public infrastructure. Unlike cars and bikes, the bill of materials for drones relies significantly less on large masses of raw materials and more on the always attractive economics of computing and Moore’s Law. In other words, drones will get cheaper and cheaper, and at a much faster rate than cars or bikes.</p>
<p>Are commercial drone flights unsafe? That depends on the driver and the regulations. Humans driving drones without proper training would certainly constitute a real hazard. But including autopilot capabilities to allow programmable flight paths not reliant on human skills might solve a lot of these issues. (In fact, I believe that in the next decade consensus will grow that humans should probably let computers do all the piloting – something <a href=\"http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/world/Experts+look+pilot+error+Asiana+crash+evidence+mechanical/8649065/story.html\">the recent Asiana crash in San Francisco hammered home</a>). Such a move, also, would confine drone traffic to specific avenues, minimizing chaos.</p>
<p>This doesn’t solve questions around collision management, altitude regulations, air rights, and potential privacy violations. (As in, a drone buzzing a hotel room for surveillance is uncool). But all of those except the privacy violations are technology questions that can be solved. Mandating altitude governors in commercially approved drones could keep drones flying in specific bands. No fly zones could be electronically enforced with geofences around airports, military bases, and political establishments, as an example.</p>
<p>Personally, I am waiting for a drone-based delivery service that mirrors what Lyft has done with cars and allows hobbyists to “volunteer” to deliver products. I imagine the reaction will be swift and Draconian. But we need some sort of push to get government moving towards incorporating drones into transportation plans.</p>
<p>Rarely do you get a win-win-win-win solution. Drones could do the job cheaper, giving people back more time to do what they want (rather than drive to the store), reduce wear and tear on our stressed cities and suburbs, and reduce pollution. Hopefully, the guys at the FAA also dream of Pizza Drones and would enjoy getting that half-gallon of milk delivered to their doorstep (or apartment balcony) within an hour or less. I certainly would.</p>

Hill" "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 15:53:59 +0000" "<p>Sci-fi films have a long history of speculating what the future might be like, seeking to understand what remnants of humanity will continue on when the world may undergo drastic change. More realistic projections focus on <a href=\"http://www.singularity.com/\">a pivotal period in the future, known as the Singularity</a>, when technological growth will be so rapid and impact the world so deeply that human life will be transformed irreversibly. By definition, it’s difficult to envision what that will look like, but how will things look right on the cusp of that key time in human history?</p>
<p>That question is at the heart of <a href=\"http://www.is-movie.com/\">a feature film in production called <em>I’s</em></a>. The film begins as the first artificial intelligence “wakes up”, and it follows a bike messenger named Mason Turk who must make a critical, personal choice in the face of the last days of “civilization as we know it.”  Currently in post-production, writer/director Chris Edgette <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1851180436/is-a-feature-film-set-on-the-threshold-of-infinity/posts\">recently launched a Kickstarter campaign</a> to raise funds to take some of the technical aspects of the film to the next level. Via email, Chris provided some further insight into what those funds will accomplish.</p>
<p>First, here’s the trailer to the film:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/70843143\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>First hearing about the technological singularity some 15 years ago, Chris was blown away. He realized that “it seems highly likely that we will be able to realize greater-than-human intelligence.” He added, “The bit that really rocked my world, though, was the understanding that we really cannot know what a super-intelligence could or would do.”</p>
<p>Setting out to make a film that dealt with these subjects presented its own challenges. ”We try to respect the scientific ideas of the singularity,” he wrote, “even though many of them could not be overtly communicated in the film.”</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What struck me about the singularity, though, was that the process of rapid escalation provides a mirror for us all. If we create a singularity that wipes away our reality entirely, have we won or have we lost, as a civilization, as a species? If it simply disappears, do we continue as before? Those last days, if one knew they were happening, would be both glorious and melancholy. We would stand on the threshold of the potential death of our civilization or its epic rebirth, with no way to see the outcome. We could console ourselves with the knowledge that we had at least birthed something entirely new to our corner of the universe, something with knowledge and understanding beyond our dreams. With that, there would be the somber understanding that we had displaced ourselves from the top of the intelligence heap on Earth.</em></p>
<p><em>How will we feel when we, the toolmakers, have invented the tool that can out-invent us? These questions drove the project.</em></p>
<p><em>The film does not view the singularity as something bad or good; the characters actually express a spectrum of views on what is about to take place. The reflection itself, however, is interesting fodder for a small independent film. When faced with a terminal illness, we wonder about what we have done in life: Was it enough? Was it right? What really did we do with our time? The singularity provides the same moment of reflection for our civilization in the last days.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>You can also hear from the actors about the subject of the film in the video produced as part of the crowdfunding pitch:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zsxegsm_hjM?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign set out to provide the final polish to the film and raise the production value. Thanks to over a hundred backers, the project’s goal of raising $18,500 was met. Chris announced in an update that a first screening for the film was now scheduled for mid-October thanks to the efforts of the backers.</p>
<p>Now with just a few days left in the campaign, Chris has set a stretch goal of $25,000, which is slated to go toward improving the “the quality and interactivity of the augmented reality interfaces, allowing us to further explore the inner mind of the AI character.”  Extra funds received beyond the project’s initial target will also improve the color timing to further professionalize the look of the film and the depth to the sound and music. All the funds are going to the film production, as Chris admitted that “There is no fat; I am entirely unpaid and the associate producer is now working for a percentage of the film returns.”</p>
<p>Hollywood continues to churn out views of the future that are critical of technology and paint bleak, inhumane futures for its protagonists to struggle within, often with artificial intelligence depicted as a destroyer of humanity, whether metaphorically or physically. Chris underscored what makes this film unique in that regard: “We visualize the inside of an AI mind in a unique way…[and it] is not judged. For dramatic purposes, the AI begins as somewhat of a menace, but as the film ends, we realize that it is a being simply trying to do what we have done: create something greater.”</p>
<p>But would facing the imminent Singularity provide a different view of life in the not-so-distant future?</p>
<p>Chris commented that “I really wanted to walk the line [between a techno-optimistic and techno-pessimistic view]. I did not want to rule on whether the technological singularity would be good or bad in a traditional sense….we also wanted to include both technological and anti-technological perspectives. The technological aspect is slightly amplified by the film’s augmented reality, which isolates people as it connects them. An ecotopic commune provides the technological counterpoint, a point for deeper connection, and a place for the main character’s decision about what to do with his remaining time.  We tried not to idealize or criticize either space, but simply to reflect the oddity and range of human existence.”</p>
<p>The Kickstarter ends on Aug 16. If you’d like to contribute to the film, <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1851180436/is-a-feature-film-set-on-the-threshold-of-infinity/posts\">you can head over to the site and make a donation</a>.</p>

<p>Engineering is often <a href=\"http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/photos/7-amazing-examples-of-biomimicry/copying-mother-nature\">inspired by nature</a>—the hooks in velcro or dermal denticles in sharkskin swimsuits. Then there’s Darpa’s <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/DSO/Programs/Systems_of_Neuromorphic_Adaptive_Plastic_Scalable_Electronics_%28SYNAPSE%29.aspx\">SyNAPSE</a> project. Not content with current computer architecture, SyNAPSE is building a new kind of computer based on the brain.</p>
<p>Last year, scientists working on SyNAPSE announced they’d <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-11/world%E2%80%99s-fastest-supercomputer-simulates-100-trillion-synapses-many-human-brain\">simulated 100 trillion synapses</a> from a monkey brain on Sequoia, one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. Now, instead of simply writing brain-inspired algorithms for traditional systems,  <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/neurosynaptic-chips.shtml\">they’ve invented</a> an entirely new “neuromorphic” chip, True North, and an accompanying programming language to build applications on it.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/J69EJxUr8mw?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>IBM’s Dharmendra S. Modha, who heads up SyNAPSE, <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/517876/ibm-scientists-show-blueprints-for-brain-like-computing/\">says</a>, “It doesn’t make sense to take a programming language from the previous era and try to adapt it to a new architecture. It’s like a square peg in a round hole. You have to rethink the very notion of what programming means.”</p>
<p>The way computers currently manipulate information, shuttling it back and forth between memory and processor, is named after the early computer scientist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture\">John von Neumann</a>. Classical computing is very good at number crunching—or left-brain activities. In fact, it vastly outstrips human capabilities.</p>
<p>But the classical approach isn’t well suited for creative, adaptive intelligence. Modha thinks computers can get better at right brain activities—like learning and recognizing color, images, and faces—by taking cues from biology.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_65495\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-166_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65495 \" alt=\"SH 166_#2\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-166_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Visualization of a simulated network of neurosynaptic chips. <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/neurosynaptic-chips.shtml\">Image Credit: IBM</a></p></div>
<p>True North is built on a network of “neurosynaptic cores” that place memory, processing, and communication close to one another so they can operate in parallel, much as they do in the brain.</p>
<p>Just as von Neumann computing required a specialized programming language (Fortran), Modha says SyNAPSE’s new architecture needed the same—so his researchers wrote a new language from the ground up, and began organizing and simplifying it for future scientists and software developers.</p>
<p>Early on, programmers had to code individual neurosynaptic cores, but the language now includes 150 “corelets,” or groups of cores with similar functionality (eg., sound perception, edge detection, or color identification). Developers only need to know the general function of a corelet to integrate it into an application.</p>
<p>Beyond more fully realizing cognitive computing, SyNAPSE’s scientists hope the new chips and language will lead to computers as efficient as the brain—which <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/neurosynaptic-chips.shtml\">consumes less</a> power than a light bulb and takes up less space than a two-liter Coke.</p>
<p>That said, Modha and SyNAPSE aren’t under any illusions that they are actually recreating the brain in all its splendor.</p>
<p>“Any simulation in some sense is always a cartoon of the reality, because the reality is very complex,” Modha <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2er6jWUGDuI#at=272\">says</a>, “But just like a cartoon can capture the essence of a situation, we hope that our simulation can capture, in a very tasteful fashion, the essence of how the brain gives rise to the mind.”</p>
<p>That is, cognitive computing is to the brain what a mechanical wing is to a bird’s wing. It takes inspiration from the biological version, improving performance, but doesn’t seek to recreate every detail.</p>
<p>Eventually, Modha thinks cognitive chips will work in concert with classical chips, “We imagine a future computer which will ship with two processors. One is a classical von Neumann processor and one is a cognitive co-processor, which will be able to deal with real world environments in the way that we can.”</p>

<p>Elon Musk has long been hinting at a high-speed form of transportation enigmatically named the Hyperloop. Earlier this summer, he promised to reveal his Hyperloop plans in August. After a round of media hype and an all-nighter with his engineers at SpaceX and Tesla Motors, Musk recently posted the 57-page <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/hyperloop_alpha-20130812.pdf\">Hyperloop Alpha</a> plan online.</p>
<p>The man isn’t known for moderation, and the Hyperloop isn’t exactly conservative. Though he says the plan is based on existing technology, the cost and design are so far on paper only. There are no proposals to build a prototype or scale it up.</p>
<p>What is the Hyperloop? After rampant speculation, we now have a very detailed vision. The Alpha plan calls for two 350+ mile tubes (one in each direction) placed side-by-side and elevated on concrete pylons. Linear electric motors accelerate a 28-passenger pod up to 760 mph and give boosts at 70-mile intervals along the way.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-167_1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65607 alignright\" alt=\"SH 167_#1\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-167_1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>At high subsonic speeds, the pods face significant resistance from the tube and air. Other proposals, like ET3, solve these problems with magnetic levitation, or maglev, and a vacuum tube.</p>
<p>But Musk says lining the tube with magnets is too expensive, and it’s incredibly difficult and costly to maintain a vacuum over hundreds of miles. (See <a href=\"http://www.et3.com/\">here</a> to learn more about ET3.)</p>
<p>His plan offers a novel way around these obstacles. First, the tube will be kept at a pressure equivalent to flying at 150,000 feet. This low-pressure environment is easier to maintain than a vacuum but still minimizes air resistance.</p>
<p>To further mitigate drag, each pod will carry an electric compressor fan up front to pass 60% of the air through a rear exhaust. Musk says the fans are like “a pump at the head of syringe actively relieving pressure.” The rest of the air will be directed into perforated skis that levitate the vehicle (the reverse of a puck on an air hockey table).</p>
<p>The pods will be pressurized, and in the event of a loss of pressure, oxygen masks will drop down. Due to the trip’s short duration, in an emergency, passengers will alert the station but otherwise continue along to their destination. The time to help will likely be less than in an aircraft—which requires rerouting, clearing runways, and taxi time.</p>
<p>Inside each pod, passengers sit in form fitting seats with personal entertainment systems mounted overhead. Initially, they’ll feel acceleration equivalent to liftoff in a commercial jet, and thanks to controlled banking in the tube (think bobsled) and variable speed, the sharpest bends will exert only light forces on folks.</p>
<p>To avoid significant curves and the cost of buying land, the Hyperloop tube follows the relatively straight path of interstate highway I-5. Solar panels will line the top of the tube and provide not only enough energy to run the Hyperloop, but potentially more. The support pylons will be equipped with dampers to help them adapt as the land settles, the structure flexes with temperature changes, or during an earthquake.</p>
<p>The Hyperloop will send travelers from San Francisco to Los Angeles in about half the time (35 minutes) and at a fraction of the cost ($20 one way) of current or proposed alternatives. Musk estimates the Hyperloop’s 40 pods could shuttle 7.4 million people each way every year, and the system could be expanded to include more stations.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-167_3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65610\" alt=\"SH 167_#3\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-167_3.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"302\" /></a></p>
<p>Although the plans are very detailed, and Musk and his cadre of engineers are some of the brightest in the world, there’s plenty of room to be skeptical. Musk knows they haven’t thought of everything (eg., an onboard bathroom), so he wants to flesh out the plans in an open source environment. Ideas are welcome.</p>
<p>But, of course, plans are paper. The Hyperloop won’t gain much traction outside the media without a real world, proof-of-concept prototype. Although Musk was initially reticent to take the project on—recently noting he may have made a mistake talking about it and that his plate is full at SpaceX and Tesla—he now says he’s considering working up at least a prototype.</p>
<p>Musk’s stated goal is to improve on California’s $68 billion high speed rail project, an undertaking he says will be one of the slowest and most expensive per mile. But are we to believe his Hyperloop cost estimate of $6 billion? That number would be more realistic if Musk himself built the Hyperloop. But if it’s up to the state? Forget about it. Cost overruns are inevitable.</p>
<p>That said, even at five times the estimated budget, the project would be half the cost of  high speed rail. And at 10 times the budget, or a cost equivalent to high speed rail, we’re still talking massive improvements on speed, travel time, and ticket cost. (And that’s if high-speed rail hits <em>its</em> stated budget—which it won’t.)</p>
<p>But forget about all the practicalities for a moment. The Hyperloop has inspired a debate about what’s possible beyond bureaucratic group-think. There are other proposals out there, but no one of Musk’s stature is standing up and backing them.</p>
<p>I don’t subscribe to the Peter Thiel school of thought that we haven’t accomplished anything of note recently. The information age enables folks to Tweet their breakfast <i>and</i> research, propose, and develop radical cancer diagnostics—as Jack Andraka <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/25/16-year-old-jack-andraka-invents-innovative-cancer-test-using-google-search/\">recently demonstrated</a> at age 16. Open information is enabling faster innovation.</p>
<p>That said, it’s valid to note that some technologies, like transportation, have been stuck in neutral since the 70s or earlier. And that’s where big thinking from the likes of Musk is more than welcome. If the guy building rockets at a fraction of traditional costs says we can do better than a moderately improved 19<sup>th</sup> century technology—maybe we can.</p>

Drone Distribution Networks Held Back By Regulators" "Alex Salkever" "Tue, 13 Aug 2013 17:36:57 +0000" "<p>I am waiting for my first pizza bomb but the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration just won’t get out of the way. I read about it on the Internet – an enterprising Domino’s franchisee in the U.K. who was <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2013/06/05/dominos-drone/\">experimenting using a drone copter for delivery</a> this summer. Alas, my wait in the U.S could be years if the FAA doesn’t get moving.</p>
<p>Despite a groundswell of interest in drones and numerous startups that plan to rely on drone flight, the <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/uas/uas_faq/\">FAA does not allow use</a> of drones for commercial purposes. Worse still, the FAA has provided no clear roadmap for freeing the skies to allow small unmanned vehicles to fly. Oddly, recreational use of drones remains entirely unchecked.</p>
<p>So why are drones such a big deal? In our robotic future, anything that can reduce urban congestion, minimize carbon emissions, save money and save trips to the emergency room (car accidents kill, you know) will drive huge value in the economy and make our lives better, to boot.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/on4DRTUvst0?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Pizza is just the start. Drones are perfect delivery vehicles for just about anything that fit in a small box or a shopping bag. Interestingly, this describes perfectly what a host of startups are attempting to do right now with people’s cars (TaskRabbit), bike messengers (PostMate), and local delivery vehicles (InstantCart, AmazonFresh). Drones are better than any of those options for a significant portion of delivery orders.</p>
<p>Here’s why. Drones are efficient, small, flexible, and not bound by gravity (unlike, say, automated cars). They can be operated remotely. They have a small carbon footprint (particularly the electrically powered drones). They do not cause wear and tear on public infrastructure. Unlike cars and bikes, the bill of materials for drones relies significantly less on large masses of raw materials and more on the always attractive economics of computing and Moore’s Law. In other words, drones will get cheaper and cheaper, and at a much faster rate than cars or bikes.</p>
<p>Are commercial drone flights unsafe? That depends on the driver and the regulations. Humans driving drones without proper training would certainly constitute a real hazard. But including autopilot capabilities to allow programmable flight paths not reliant on human skills might solve a lot of these issues. (In fact, I believe that in the next decade consensus will grow that humans should probably let computers do all the piloting – something <a href=\"http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/world/Experts+look+pilot+error+Asiana+crash+evidence+mechanical/8649065/story.html\">the recent Asiana crash in San Francisco hammered home</a>). Such a move, also, would confine drone traffic to specific avenues, minimizing chaos.</p>
<p>This doesn’t solve questions around collision management, altitude regulations, air rights, and potential privacy violations. (As in, a drone buzzing a hotel room for surveillance is uncool). But all of those except the privacy violations are technology questions that can be solved. Mandating altitude governors in commercially approved drones could keep drones flying in specific bands. No fly zones could be electronically enforced with geofences around airports, military bases, and political establishments, as an example.</p>
<p>Personally, I am waiting for a drone-based delivery service that mirrors what Lyft has done with cars and allows hobbyists to “volunteer” to deliver products. I imagine the reaction will be swift and Draconian. But we need some sort of push to get government moving towards incorporating drones into transportation plans.</p>
<p>Rarely do you get a win-win-win-win solution. Drones could do the job cheaper, giving people back more time to do what they want (rather than drive to the store), reduce wear and tear on our stressed cities and suburbs, and reduce pollution. Hopefully, the guys at the FAA also dream of Pizza Drones and would enjoy getting that half-gallon of milk delivered to their doorstep (or apartment balcony) within an hour or less. I certainly would.</p>

Hill" "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 15:53:59 +0000" "<p>Sci-fi films have a long history of speculating what the future might be like, seeking to understand what remnants of humanity will continue on when the world may undergo drastic change. More realistic projections focus on <a href=\"http://www.singularity.com/\">a pivotal period in the future, known as the Singularity</a>, when technological growth will be so rapid and impact the world so deeply that human life will be transformed irreversibly. By definition, it’s difficult to envision what that will look like, but how will things look right on the cusp of that key time in human history?</p>
<p>That question is at the heart of <a href=\"http://www.is-movie.com/\">a feature film in production called <em>I’s</em></a>. The film begins as the first artificial intelligence “wakes up”, and it follows a bike messenger named Mason Turk who must make a critical, personal choice in the face of the last days of “civilization as we know it.”  Currently in post-production, writer/director Chris Edgette <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1851180436/is-a-feature-film-set-on-the-threshold-of-infinity/posts\">recently launched a Kickstarter campaign</a> to raise funds to take some of the technical aspects of the film to the next level. Via email, Chris provided some further insight into what those funds will accomplish.</p>
<p>First, here’s the trailer to the film:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/70843143\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>First hearing about the technological singularity some 15 years ago, Chris was blown away. He realized that “it seems highly likely that we will be able to realize greater-than-human intelligence.” He added, “The bit that really rocked my world, though, was the understanding that we really cannot know what a super-intelligence could or would do.”</p>
<p>Setting out to make a film that dealt with these subjects presented its own challenges. ”We try to respect the scientific ideas of the singularity,” he wrote, “even though many of them could not be overtly communicated in the film.”</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What struck me about the singularity, though, was that the process of rapid escalation provides a mirror for us all. If we create a singularity that wipes away our reality entirely, have we won or have we lost, as a civilization, as a species? If it simply disappears, do we continue as before? Those last days, if one knew they were happening, would be both glorious and melancholy. We would stand on the threshold of the potential death of our civilization or its epic rebirth, with no way to see the outcome. We could console ourselves with the knowledge that we had at least birthed something entirely new to our corner of the universe, something with knowledge and understanding beyond our dreams. With that, there would be the somber understanding that we had displaced ourselves from the top of the intelligence heap on Earth.</em></p>
<p><em>How will we feel when we, the toolmakers, have invented the tool that can out-invent us? These questions drove the project.</em></p>
<p><em>The film does not view the singularity as something bad or good; the characters actually express a spectrum of views on what is about to take place. The reflection itself, however, is interesting fodder for a small independent film. When faced with a terminal illness, we wonder about what we have done in life: Was it enough? Was it right? What really did we do with our time? The singularity provides the same moment of reflection for our civilization in the last days.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>You can also hear from the actors about the subject of the film in the video produced as part of the crowdfunding pitch:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zsxegsm_hjM?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign set out to provide the final polish to the film and raise the production value. Thanks to over a hundred backers, the project’s goal of raising $18,500 was met. Chris announced in an update that a first screening for the film was now scheduled for mid-October thanks to the efforts of the backers.</p>
<p>Now with just a few days left in the campaign, Chris has set a stretch goal of $25,000, which is slated to go toward improving the “the quality and interactivity of the augmented reality interfaces, allowing us to further explore the inner mind of the AI character.”  Extra funds received beyond the project’s initial target will also improve the color timing to further professionalize the look of the film and the depth to the sound and music. All the funds are going to the film production, as Chris admitted that “There is no fat; I am entirely unpaid and the associate producer is now working for a percentage of the film returns.”</p>
<p>Hollywood continues to churn out views of the future that are critical of technology and paint bleak, inhumane futures for its protagonists to struggle within, often with artificial intelligence depicted as a destroyer of humanity, whether metaphorically or physically. Chris underscored what makes this film unique in that regard: “We visualize the inside of an AI mind in a unique way…[and it] is not judged. For dramatic purposes, the AI begins as somewhat of a menace, but as the film ends, we realize that it is a being simply trying to do what we have done: create something greater.”</p>
<p>But would facing the imminent Singularity provide a different view of life in the not-so-distant future?</p>
<p>Chris commented that “I really wanted to walk the line [between a techno-optimistic and techno-pessimistic view]. I did not want to rule on whether the technological singularity would be good or bad in a traditional sense….we also wanted to include both technological and anti-technological perspectives. The technological aspect is slightly amplified by the film’s augmented reality, which isolates people as it connects them. An ecotopic commune provides the technological counterpoint, a point for deeper connection, and a place for the main character’s decision about what to do with his remaining time.  We tried not to idealize or criticize either space, but simply to reflect the oddity and range of human existence.”</p>
<p>The Kickstarter ends on Aug 16. If you’d like to contribute to the film, <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1851180436/is-a-feature-film-set-on-the-threshold-of-infinity/posts\">you can head over to the site and make a donation</a>.</p>

<p>Engineering is often <a href=\"http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/photos/7-amazing-examples-of-biomimicry/copying-mother-nature\">inspired by nature</a>—the hooks in velcro or dermal denticles in sharkskin swimsuits. Then there’s Darpa’s <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/DSO/Programs/Systems_of_Neuromorphic_Adaptive_Plastic_Scalable_Electronics_%28SYNAPSE%29.aspx\">SyNAPSE</a> project. Not content with current computer architecture, SyNAPSE is building a new kind of computer based on the brain.</p>
<p>Last year, scientists working on SyNAPSE announced they’d <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-11/world%E2%80%99s-fastest-supercomputer-simulates-100-trillion-synapses-many-human-brain\">simulated 100 trillion synapses</a> from a monkey brain on Sequoia, one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. Now, instead of simply writing brain-inspired algorithms for traditional systems,  <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/neurosynaptic-chips.shtml\">they’ve invented</a> an entirely new “neuromorphic” chip, True North, and an accompanying programming language to build applications on it.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/J69EJxUr8mw?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>IBM’s Dharmendra S. Modha, who heads up SyNAPSE, <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/517876/ibm-scientists-show-blueprints-for-brain-like-computing/\">says</a>, “It doesn’t make sense to take a programming language from the previous era and try to adapt it to a new architecture. It’s like a square peg in a round hole. You have to rethink the very notion of what programming means.”</p>
<p>The way computers currently manipulate information, shuttling it back and forth between memory and processor, is named after the early computer scientist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture\">John von Neumann</a>. Classical computing is very good at number crunching—or left-brain activities. In fact, it vastly outstrips human capabilities.</p>
<p>But the classical approach isn’t well suited for creative, adaptive intelligence. Modha thinks computers can get better at right brain activities—like learning and recognizing color, images, and faces—by taking cues from biology.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_65495\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-166_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65495 \" alt=\"SH 166_#2\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-166_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Visualization of a simulated network of neurosynaptic chips. <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/neurosynaptic-chips.shtml\">Image Credit: IBM</a></p></div>
<p>True North is built on a network of “neurosynaptic cores” that place memory, processing, and communication close to one another so they can operate in parallel, much as they do in the brain.</p>
<p>Just as von Neumann computing required a specialized programming language (Fortran), Modha says SyNAPSE’s new architecture needed the same—so his researchers wrote a new language from the ground up, and began organizaing and simplifying it for future scientists and software developers.</p>
<p>Early on, programmers had to code individual neurosynaptic cores, but the language now includes 150 “corelets,” or groups of cores with similar functionality (eg., sound perception, edge detection, or color identification). Developers only need to know the general function of a corelet to integrate it into an application.</p>
<p>Beyond more fully realizing cognitive computing, SyNAPSE’s scientists hope the new chips and language will lead to computers as efficient as the brain—which <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/neurosynaptic-chips.shtml\">consumes less</a> power than a light bulb and takes up less space than a two-liter Coke.</p>
<p>That said, Modha and SyNAPSE aren’t under any illusions that they are actually recreating the brain in all its splendor.</p>
<p>“Any simulation in some sense is always a cartoon of the reality, because the reality is very complex,” Modha <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2er6jWUGDuI#at=272\">says</a>, “But just like a cartoon can capture the essence of a situation, we hope that our simulation can capture, in a very tasteful fashion, the essence of how the brain gives rise to the mind.”</p>
<p>That is, cognitive computing is to the brain what a mechanical wing is to a bird’s wing. It takes inspiration from the biological version, improving performance, but doesn’t seek to recreate every detail.</p>
<p>Eventually, Modha thinks cognitive chips will work in concert with classical chips, “We imagine a future computer which will ship with two processors. One is a classical von Neumann processor and one is a cognitive co-processor, which will be able to deal with real world environments in the way that we can.”</p>

<p>As Americans use digital methods for more of their interpersonal communications, law enforcement agencies have seized the opportunity to scoop up more information for cheaper than they could before, hoping to ferret out criminal activity. But violent crime still takes place in the physical world, with fragile human bodies on the line. A growing number of U.S. police departments are using a system of sound-detecting software to locate and respond to gunfire in hopes of catching more shooters and saving more victims.</p>
<p>ShotSpotter, the dominant gunfire detection technology on the market, gathers data from a network of acoustic sensors placed at 30-foot elevation under a mile apart. To cut costs, most cities use the sensors only in selected areas. The system filters the data through an algorithm that isolates the sound of gunfire. If shots are fired anywhere in the coverage area, the software triangulates their location to within about 10 feet and reports the activity to the police dispatcher. The system is generally more accurate and more reliable than would-be 911 callers, in part because in the worst neighborhoods, residents don’t even bother to report gunshots.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/gun-firing.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-65423\" alt=\"gun-firing\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/gun-firing.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Roughly 70 U.S. cities currently use ShotSpotter, which is made by the Newark, Calif., company SST. More police departments began subscribing to ShotSpotter after the company launched in 2011 a cloud-hosting platform that made the system more affordable for small and mid-size cities.</p>
<p>Last month, SST began using the data its systems collect nationally to <a href=\"http://www.shotspotter.com/press-releases/article/sst-inc.-launches-national-gunfire-index\">publish</a> a quarterly index of gun activity in the United States. The index is based on data from a statistically representative set of about 120 square miles in just over 30 cities that use ShotSpotter. SST hopes the information will support the government’s rekindled interest — in the wake of the Newton, Conn., shootings — in research on gun violence. Of course, the <a href=\"http://www.shotspotter.com/ngi\">index</a> is also a clever marketing effort, emphasizing just how much the old human methods of reporting gun violence don’t tell us about gun use.</p>
<p>Currently, data on gun violence comes primarily from three main sources: 911 calls, mandatory reports hospitals file when they treat gunshot victims, and coroner reports on homicides or suicides involving guns. Such methods don’t document shots fired to scare people or kill animals. They also overlook, for example, gun battles in which bystanders don’t call police and victims seek to evade police attention by doctoring wounds themselves. All told, less than 20 percent of gunshots result in a 911 call, according to SST.</p>
<p>“Gun violence is significantly under reported — and misreported — at the very moment this critical epidemic needs precise and reliable data from a research perspective,” <a href=\"http://www.shotspotter.com/press-releases/article/sst-inc.-launches-national-gunfire-index\">said</a> SST CEO Ralph Clark.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sst-infographic.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-65425\" alt=\"sst-infographic\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sst-infographic.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>SST’s data at least partially explains why more people don’t report gunfire to authorities. In the most active city in its index, an area covering a single square mile experienced 2,858 bullets fired in a three-month period. That’s 32 rounds fired every day. (The locations of the events included in the index are not identified.)</p>
<p>Another interesting nugget: Celebratory gunfire isn’t unique to foreign countries. In the United States, gunfire on New Year’s Day made up nearly half of all gunshots in January.</p>
<p>Sadly, gunfire increased in the United States in the second quarter of this year. The number of incidents recorded in the second quarter was nearly 50 percent higher than those in the first quarter. The trend included not just the most violent cities but also more moderate ones.</p>
<p>ShotSpotter adds to the nationwide trend toward data-driven policing, epitomized by the CompStat system introduced in New York City in the mid-1990s. Law enforcement officers see data as a way to help them allocate resources effectively.</p>
<p>“Today’s most effective policing strategies combine proven practices and tactics with new data and intelligence. When you consider the tragic consequences of gun violence, it’s critical that law enforcement professionals have all of the information available to more effectively deploy resources in high crime areas,” Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis <a href=\"http://www.shotspotter.com/press-releases/article/sst-inc.-launches-national-gunfire-index\">said</a> in an SST press release.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/firecrackers.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-65430\" alt=\"firecrackers\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/firecrackers.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>But critics have pointed to problems with the technology and ShotSpotter has met with some resistance in many of the cities that now use it.</p>
<p>Some are frustrated that, given the steep cost of the system, it doesn’t always successfully differentiate the sounds of guns firing from those of cars backfiring or firecrackers exploding. A San Francisco Police Department spokesman told Singularity Hub the system has trouble with fireworks, and a recent audit in Suffolk County, New York <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/columnists/rick-brand/value-of-suffolk-s-shotspotter-system-questioned-1.5682970\">found similar problems</a>.</p>
<p>Some also fear the police will use the technology selectively, spurring more arrests in some neighborhoods than in others.</p>
<p>“Part of the problem with law enforcement technology is that you want to put it in the place where there’s hot crime. So you’re listening in on some neighborhoods more than others, but you want to deploy resources where there’s the most crime. This is a question for police departments more generally that goes beyond just this technology,” Sarah Lawrence, the director of policy analysis at the <a href=\"http://www.law.berkeley.edu/ewi.htm\">Warren Institute</a> at Berkeley law school, told Singularity Hub.</p>
<p>But because ShotSpotter’s sensors only pick up gunfire and the occasional firecracker, not conversation, the technology <a href=\"http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_23755563/oakland-consider-privacy-concerns-over-surveillance-program\">doesn’t seem to raise hackles</a> as much as license plate scanners and video cameras do. Still, city residents will likely form more informed opinions of the technology as their local police departments get used to it, using it not just to dispatch officers more quickly to potential crime scenes, but also to identify and prosecute the perpetrators.</p>
<p>ShotSpotter has already been used as evidence in hundreds of criminal cases and has helped secure at least one murder <a href=\"http://www.shotspotter.com/press-releases/article/evidence-captured-by-shotspotter-gunshot-location-system--gls-assists-murde\">conviction</a>, according to SST.</p>

<p>Georgia Tech researchers <a href=\"http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?nid=226411\">recently unveiled</a> a reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa that would likely make the Renaissance master’s jaw drop. At just 30 microns across, the image is 100,000 times smaller than the real thing—or roughly 1/3<sup>rd</sup> the width of a human hair.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-162_3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65259 alignright\" alt=\"SH 162_#3\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-162_3.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" /></a>Of course, the team, led by associate professor, Jennifer Curtis, didn’t use brush and paint to compose their “Mini Lisa.” In place of traditional tools, they employed an atomic force microscope, a special substrate, and a series of heat-induced nanoscale chemical reactions. The technique is called <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la400996w\">ThermoChemical NanoLithography</a> (TCNL).</p>
<p>An <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy\">atomic force microscope </a>can be compared to a record player—the microscope drags an incredibly sharp “needle” across a surface to image its undulations by measuring how much the needle (tip) and arm (cantilever) are deflected. In this case, however, the cantilever was modified with a heated tip.</p>
<p>The team took a greyscale copy of the Mona Lisa and assigned each pixel a temperature. The higher the temperature, the more molecules produced in the chemical reaction induced by the cantilever’s heated tip.</p>
<p>The team positioned the cantilever pixel by pixel, carefully controlling the temperature to achieve the appropriate shading—until voilà, a miniature masterpiece. In the finished image (above), dark pixels are coldest, light pixels hottest, and a range of greys fall in between. The pixels are spaced 125 nanometers apart.</p>
<p>Reproducing a nanoscale Mona Lisa is an excellent way to get the word out on their technique and show off its power, but the team thinks the technology has practical applications beyond the microscopic art world.</p>
<p>“We envision TCNL will be capable of patterning gradients of other physical or chemical properties, such as conductivity of graphene,” Curtis said. “This technique should enable a wide range of previously inaccessible experiments and applications in fields as diverse as nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and bioengineering.”</p>

<p>“Hey! If you were a hotdog, and you were starving, would you eat yourself?” That’s <a href=\"http://snltranscripts.jt.org/97/97jupdate.phtml\">Will Ferrell as Harry Caray</a> contemplating deep ethical questions. Here’s another more realistic one, “If your ballpark burger were grown in a petri dish, would you eat it?”</p>
<p>A food writer, a food researcher, and a scientist attempted to answer that question Monday, when they tasted a lab-grown (or cultured) burger at a press event in London. The burger itself was grown in about three months, but the technology behind it took Maastricht University’s Professor Mark Post €250,000 and five years to develop.</p>
<p>We covered the story back in <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2009/12/09/artificial-meat-could-be-on-your-table-in-5-years/\">2009</a>, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/02/28/lab-grown-burger-to-be-served-in-six-months/\">2012</a>, and more recently, in May of <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/22/you-can-now-place-your-order-for-a-burger-grown-entirely-in-a-lab/\">this year</a>. The specifics haven’t changed terribly much, but one item most certainly has—always referred to as a “mystery investor,” the money man behind the project was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/05/google-sergey-brin-synthetic-beef-hamburger\">recently revealed</a> as Google’s Sergey Brin. In fact, he makes a cameo in the team’s pitch video.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/gdMQND4TPqM?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>How exactly do you make a burger in a lab?</p>
<p>Step one: Bovine biopsy. The team removed muscle cells from the shoulder of a cow and placed them in a petri dish around a cylindrical gel scaffold where they fed on a nutrient mix, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_bovine_serum\">fetal bovine serum</a> and antibiotics. (According to Post, they hope to move away from both fetal bovine serum and antibiotics in the future.)</p>
<p>Once anchored in place the ring of cells reflexively contract (no electric current necessary) and grow into a strand of muscle tissue. 20,000 such strands went into the finished burger. Each cell can create a trillion more like it, or as Professor Post notes, just a few cells become ten tons of meat.</p>
<p>Of course, the question of the day is, “What does this cultured beef burger taste like?”</p>
<p>Post was <a href=\"http://culturedbeef.net/event/\">joined by</a> Chicago food writer, Josh Schonwald, nutrition researcher, Hanni Rützler, and a chef, Richard McGeown, to cook the burger. Because the patty doesn’t naturally look exactly like a real burger—it lacks fat and blood—the researchers colored it with beet juice and saffron. McGeown noted it cooked just like a traditional burger.</p>
<p>As for the taste, let’s just say, it’s light years from “<a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2009/12/09/artificial-meat-could-be-on-your-table-in-5-years/\">soggy pork</a>” but would still be a challenging secret ingredient on <em>Iron Chef</em>. Rützler and Schonwald agreed the texture was very meaty but lean and not terribly juicy. Further, the taste was clearly lacking something—most likely added flavoring from fat.</p>
<p>Post told the audience the team is working to add fat, but culturing fat cells isn’t as easy as culturing muscle cells. He reiterated the burger is a proof-of-concept. Now that they’ve shown it can be done, it’s time to perfect the process. And along those lines, he said, “I think it’s a very good start.”</p>
<p>Cultured meat research is largely driven by the sense that the modern meat industry is unethical, unhealthy, and unsustainable. Theoretically, lab-grown meat would eventually be nearly identical to meat from a living cow, chicken, or pig, would remove the need to slaughter the animal, and would consume fewer resources in production.</p>
<p>Although Post’s cultured burger got an avalanche of press with his special London event—over 200 journalists and academics attended—there are others at work on cultured animal products. Singularity University’s <a href=\"http://modernmeadow.com/\">Modern Meadow</a>, for example, uses tissue engineering to create cultured leather and plans to apply similar technologies to meat production in the future.</p>
<p>We contacted the founder and CEO of Modern Meadow, Andras Forgacs, to put the London demonstration in perspective. He told us, ”It still needs work in terms of flavor and becoming entirely animal slaughter-free, but it was an important proof-of-concept.” The fact the meat was visually pleasing, cooked well, and had a favorable mouth feel made the event a milestone in cultured meat.</p>
<p>So what’s next? As one journalist in the audience pointed out, there’s really no reason to stop at cows. Once perfected, you can take cells from any bird, mammal, or fish. And Forgacs notes that while the current focus is understandably on meat, similar “solutions are needed for other animal products which deplete the environment and cause animal harm—such as ivory, rhino horn, leather, shark fin, etc.”</p>
<p>As for meat, according to Post you won’t be buying tiger, bear, or penguin patties too soon—or even beef ones, for that matter. He estimates it’ll take a good 10 to 20 years to bring the tech from lab to grocery. That said, sometimes things move faster than even the experts expect. Forgacs said, “A decade is realistic for grocery sales. Twenty years is hopefully too conservative. Before then, however, I anticipate cultured meat being available at private tasting events and perhaps some adventurous restaurants.”</p>

<p>There’s a new perk in high-end apartment buildings—fully robotic parking lots. No more careless valet dinging the Rolls at 1706 Rittenhouse, Philadelphia. Tenants pull their car onto a lift and the system takes it from there. When a tenant wants to leave, they swipe a special fob, and the system locates and retrieves their car.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/w3vtpGtyw1k?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>For those who haven’t encountered one, it may surprise that automated parking lots aren’t new at all. Although they’ve taken longer to catch on in the US, Asia and Europe have been using them for years. According to Shannon Sanders of Southern Illinois University, <a href=\"http://www.trforum.org/forum/downloads/2012_112_Cars_Parking_Sustain.pdf\">Japan has 1.6 million</a> automated parking spots. And check out this robotic parking tower in Germany:</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/7vr7ofPTpcM?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Here in the US, there are automated or semi-automated garages across the country, including in New York, Philadelphia, Miami, and Los Angeles. In 2016, the Porsche Design Tower in Miami <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/realestate/automated-parking-garages-for-the-car-obsessed.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\">will offer</a> a lift and parking spot right next to your apartment for a mere $500,000 (on top of the $22+ million you’ve already shelled out.)</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5XcQIVf78NE?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Wider use of automated parking garages could make for more efficient future cities. Even with bike lanes and public transportation, parking is a perennial problem in dense urban environments, where space is a precious commodity.</p>
<p>In automated garages, each car can be parked much closer to its neighbors as there are no doors opening and shutting or space needed for manual parking maneuvers. Nobody accesses the car while it’s parked, so the space above can be reduced. And of course, there’s no need to build ramps, lanes, stairs, or elevators for folks to enter and leave.</p>
<p>Depending on whether automated garages are above or below ground, <a href=\"http://www.walkerparking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Monahan-Robotic-Parking-Pkg-Prof-Sept-2012.pdf\">building costs</a> can be competitive with traditional garages, and they can bring in more income per cubic foot (twice the parking capacity for the same volume). Automated garages reduce some operating costs, like labor, ventilation, and lighting, but they add others, like expensive maintenance and hefty electric bills.</p>
<p>Less tangible benefits include saved time looking for a spot, fewer break-ins, and enhanced safety and convenience for drivers, who no longer have to wander sparsely populated lots trying to remember where they parked.</p>
<p>For urban planners, however, perhaps the best argument in favor of automation is that unlike traditional garages, which tend to sprawl, automated auto towers can be built narrow and tall, reducing their footprint. Perhaps as parking spaces extend skyward, future cities will become more livable on the ground.</p>

<p>As six-legged robots go, other than its nifty red and yellow paint job, the Crabster robot has a pretty standard look. It isn’t the biggest hexapod, like the impressive <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/04/13/meet-the-two-ton-robotic-mantis-a-hexadpod-you-can-ride-in/\">two-ton Mantis</a>, or a tiny hexapod with a weird gait, like <a href=\"http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_rhex.html\">Boston Dynamics’ RHex</a>. What makes Crabster special isn’t so much what it is but where it will walk—the robot was designed to <a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/six-legged-underwater-robot-crabster#.UfgTRc_B5rg.facebook\">navigate the seafloor</a>.</p>
<p>Ocean researchers already use both autonomous and remote-control undersea vehicles, but propulsion systems tend to kick up sediment, adversely affecting visibility, and lack the power to deal with strong currents.</p>
<p>Crabster’s creators designed the robot to solve these problems. Developed by the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (<a href=\"http://eng.kiost.ac/kordi_eng/?sub_num=354\">KIOST</a>), the robot can withstand heavy currents by changing its posture (roll, pitch, and yaw), and the robot’s measured gait won’t significantly disturb sediment.</p>
<p>Crabster is lowered to the seafloor by crane and remains attached to an umbilical for power, limiting where it can go but allowing for continuous operation. Four operators remotely drive the robot from the surface—directing and monitoring its movement, manipulators, cameras, lights, and sonar.</p>
<p>On the seafloor, the half-ton robot illuminates murky water with a spotlight, records what it sees with <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/video/2013/08/01/giant-crab-robot-to-help-explore-what-li?videoId=244519507&videoChannel=1004\">ten onboard cameras</a>, and uses its two front legs to pick up and manipulate objects. Researchers hope to send Crabster to explore shipwrecks where they can return small treasures in the robot’s retractable tray. They’ll haul larger objects by attaching a tow cable connected to the vessel above.</p>
<p>Crabster recently took its first dip in the ocean and will soon head out to sea to begin work 200 meters below the surface. Eventually Crabster’s engineers hope to give it an onboard power source, and we imagine future iterations might combine the best of both worlds—a Crabster that folds its legs to go swimming and, when a stroll better suits its purposes, deploys its legs for a landing on the sea-floor.</p>

<p>Remember watching Tony Stark design his Iron Man suit with a few flicks of his hands, rearranging digital parts and pieces projected in midair? It’ll be like that. Or even better, it’ll be like Tom Cruise in <i>Minority Report</i>. The tech world was full of pop sci-fi references as folks awaited the touchless Leap controller over the last year, and we were (are) <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/05/hype-or-hope-well-soon-find-out-leap-motion-minority-report-controller-ships-in-may/\">right there</a> in the thick of it. (And I suppose we just added another one. Shoot.)</p>
<p>After a few delays, the Leap was finally released in July, and you could almost feel all that air being let out of the balloon. It was probably inevitable. The bar was set pretty high by the press and Leap alike. Although we might add, a little deflation doesn’t invalidate the surge of interest the concept kicked up. People love this idea.</p>
<p>But what about the execution? There are plenty of reviews from just about every major tech outlet and many mainstream sites to boot. Common descriptions include cool but frustrating, flawed, not quite there yet, and “<a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9241119/Leap_Motion_Controller_review_A_touchscreen_interface_without_the_touching\">it’s more of a toy than a tool</a>.”</p>
<p>Ars Technica posted a <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/07/hands-on-with-the-leap-motion-controller-cool-but-frustrating-as-hell/\">pretty entertaining video</a> on the topic, concluding, “Okay, so maybe the future still needs a little bit of work.”</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-156_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65109 alignright\" alt=\"SH 156_#2\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-156_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Some of the highlighted problems appear to be more about a user interaction method still in its infancy. The quality of third party apps, for example, is spotty at best. Google Earth, Touchless (the software that allows you to navigate your OS), and others are reportedly unintuitive and difficult to use.</p>
<p>This isn’t a killer. The apps will likely improve. Remember, developers have had, at most, six months to perfect their products. The selection of 75 apps currently in Leap’s app store, Airspace, may well grow and get better in the coming months.</p>
<p>Other complaints cut deeper. A common one, for example, is arm fatigue. When typing or using a mouse, our arms rest on the desk or table most of the time. But Leap requires you hold your arm or arms above the controller for however long you’re working. And if you bring them down to rest then back up or move your hands to the keyboard, the Leap can misinterpret the movement as a gesture.</p>
<p>The difficulty in replacing a ubiquitous piece of equipment, like a mouse, is in part due to the fact that users have to learn something new and that feels unnatural. Most of the reviews written so far are based on a few days working with the Leap. And a full vocabulary of gestures and shortcuts hasn’t been invented or learned yet.</p>
<p>Further, there is a key ingredient missing from the <i>Iron Man</i> references (other than an AI capable of witty banter). Where are the 3D holographic computer interfaces? The Leap is a 3D controller in a world tailored to 2D. To a certain degree, developers are forcing a round peg into a square hole by adding Leap functionality to existing apps.</p>
<p>If we really want full gesture control, perhaps operating systems will evolve away from their (almost) flat environments to fully 3D ones. Or maybe in the near future, we’ll continue using a mouse for 2D user interfaces most of the time, but use gesture control for the ones that are already 3D—modeling environments, like CAD, for example.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-156_1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65107 alignleft\" alt=\"SH 156_#1\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SH-156_1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>The Leap’s inventor, David Holz, said <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/25/leap-motion-gesture-control-technology-hands-on/\">his original goal</a> wasn’t necessarily replacing the mouse so much as figuring out how to make “molding virtual clay as easy as molding clay in the real world.”</p>
<p>It’s useful to compare gesture control to the last “leap” in user interfaces—mobile touch screens. Why did touch screens catch on like wildfire? Instead of trying to pair a touch screen with an operating system, device, and user interface tailored for a mouse, Apple created an entirely new operating system and user interface specifically for touch screens. The hardware was married to the software from the beginning.</p>
<p>Further, the touch screen wasn’t intended to replace the mouse. It was supposed to replace bulkier, less efficient interfaces in mobile computing. Remember texting with your phone’s number keys? And in practice, the touch screen isn’t supplanting the mouse (or track pad) in laptops or desktops. Rather, devices tailored to touch screens, like tablets and smartphones, are replacing devices that aren’t.</p>
<p>To fully catch on, gesture control may need a device designed for it from the ground up. Until holographic displays or fully 3D user interfaces come along, gesture control may remain a cool but ultimately niche product. For now, the mouse is still king.</p>

<p>The smell of urine is not usually associated with having life-saving properties. But a new UK device called the ‘<a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263029.php\">Odoreader’</a> can analyze urine odors and determine if bladder cancer is present. Although this is a pilot study, it has positive implications for early bladder cancer diagnosis and improved patient survival.</p>
<p>In the US, an <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/bladder\">estimated 72,570 new bladder cancer cases</a> will be diagnosed in 2013 with 15,210 succumbing to the disease. Unlike other cancers, bladder cancer has few reliable biomarkers (chemical or protein signatures of disease) for detection. Doctors currently use cystoscopy to identify bladder cancer. Therefore, bladder cancer is generally detected only at later stages when the patient’s survival chances are diminished. As with most cancers, earlier detection is of critical importance.</p>
<p>When detected early enough, a transurethral resection procedure yields a 94% five-year survival rate. However, the disease recurs in approximately 50-70% of patients and these require follow-up procedures.</p>
<p>Other diagnostic approaches, including hematuria (blood in urine) dipstick, NMP22 and UroVysion, have been assessed and determined not sensitive enough for accurate bladder cancer detection. Canines have reportedly sniffed out bladder cancer in urine samples. While this is not the best approach for examinations in a clinical setting—the general principle is sound.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_65082\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BladderCancer2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65082\" alt=\"Gas chromatograph.\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BladderCancer2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gas chromatograph.</p></div>
<p>The Odoreader device, developed by researchers led by Professor Norman Ratcliffe at the UWE Bristol and Professor Chris Probert at the University of Liverpool, is something of a synthetic “dog’s nose” and can detect or “smell” a specific odor given off by cancer cells in heated urine samples.</p>
<p>The approach <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0069602\">uses a novel combination</a> of gas chromatography (GC) and a sensor system to detect volatile organic compounds (VOC). The differences between the VOC of cancer and normal cells might be due to differences associated with their metabolism. Evidence supporting this showed formaldehyde levels from urine were higher in men with prostate cancer than those without cancer.</p>
<p>This new detection approach would potentially facilitate early bladder cancer diagnosis at low cost and reduced inconvenience to the patient.</p>
<p>The initial Odoreader pilot study used 98 samples of urine from men, 24 known to have bladder cancer and 74 with bladder-related problems but no cancer. The results demonstrated over 90% accuracy in detecting the urine from bladder cancer patients. However, Probert said, “We now need to look at larger samples of patients to test the device further before it can be used in hospitals.”</p>
<p>If the results are just as promising in larger, more diverse sample sizes then smaller Odoreaders might be developed for testing at home. And perhaps before long, entrepreneurs will miniaturize and fold such tests into one tricorder-like device for closer to real-time health monitoring and ever-earlier diagnosis.</p>
<p>That’s when doctors and patients, so often behind the curve, begin to catch up with and even overtake the disease they are racing.</p>

<p>As tech memes go, the <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_internet_of_things\">Internet of Things</a> is getting a bit long in tooth. The idea of internet-connected smart stuff has been heralded for years now. But where exactly are we in the quest to connect all things?</p>
<p>Networking titan Cisco decided to <a href=\"http://newsroom.cisco.com/feature-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1208342\">put a number</a> on it.</p>
<p>According to Cisco, there are an estimated 1.5 trillion things in the world (no mention of exactly how they counted those things, but let’s go with it) and approximately 8.7 billion, or 0.6%, were connected in 2012. The firm expects a 25% annualized decrease in price to connect between 2012 and 2020 and a matching 25% annualized increase in connectivity. That means we can expect 50 billion connected things by 2020, with 50% of those connections happening in the final three years of the decade.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_65033\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-158_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65033\" alt=\"Source: Cisco \" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-158_2.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"414\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"http://newsroom.cisco.com/feature-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1208342\">Cisco</a></p></div>
<p>Fifty billion sounds like a big number, but one could argue Cisco’s forecast is pretty conservative. Of their estimated 1.8 trillion total things in 2020, 50 billion would be a mere 2.7% of the total. Yes, it’s an increase from 2012′s 0.6%—but a fairly modest increase as these things go. Cisco is a big company, and it pays to be careful.</p>
<p>Maybe we can go out on a limb where Cisco can’t. The firm bases its projected annualized growth rate primarily on the decreasing price to connect. But there are other drivers too—the declining price and increasing power of embedded chips, for example. Or rapidly improving “big data” software that makes all that new information useful, and therefore more highly demanded.</p>
<p>In a world of exponential technology, things can move faster than our linear brains can fathom. If the number of connected things grew at twice Cisco’s predicted annualized rate, we’d have 223 billion connected things, or 12% of the total, by 2020. At a little less than quadruple Cisco’s forecast, we’d be talking 1.5 trillion connected things, or 82% of the total, by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Is Cisco undercutting annualized growth by a factor of four? Hard to say for sure. But it might not be out of the realm of possibility. How many cell phones were connected to the internet seven years ago? And how many are now? Whatever the ultimate pace is, Cisco is right about one thing. The world is moving toward greater interconnectivity and smarter things, and the pace is accelerating.</p>

<p>What if we could reverse degenerative forms of blindness with but an injection of new cells? Stem cell therapies—still promising, if not particularly speedy in their development—may someday do just that. A <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0713/21072013-Scientists-transplant-photoreceptors-from-retina-grown-in-a-dish-Ali\">recent paper</a> in the journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nbt/index.html\">Nature Biotechnology</a> documents the successful implantation of photoreceptors, grown from embryonic stem cells, into the retinas of night-blind mice.</p>
<p>A team of researchers at UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital, led by Professor Robin Ali, obtained the  photoreceptors from a “synthetic retina” grown in a lab dish using a new 3D cell culturing technique recently developed in Japan. The method more closely mimics the natural process of retinal growth in embryos, and allows researchers to better control the process of cell selection and extraction.</p>
<p>The researchers injected roughly 200,000 of the cultured cells into living mouse retinas where they not only took root but remained present six weeks after implantation and formed the necessary neural connections to communicate visual data to the brain.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-155_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64944 alignright\" alt=\"SH 155_#2\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-155_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Professor Ali and his team previously showed that injected photoreceptors from healthy mice can help blind mice see again, but the method, even if proven effective in humans, would suffer from a shortage of donor cells. The team’s latest study shows lab-grown cell lines could provide a reliable supply for patients.</p>
<p>The technique has only been shown successful in mice so far, but Ali says, “The next step will be to refine this technique using human cells to enable us to start clinical trials.”</p>
<p>Clinical trials of neural stem cell implants like this are still years away, but trials of less complex stem cell therapies for the retina are already underway. Scientists at UCLA, for example, are <a href=\"http://today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/the-promises-of-stem-cells-247547.aspx\">conducting a clinical trial</a> involving patients suffering from macular degeneration and Stargardt’s macular dystrophy—two common degenerative diseases causing blindness later in life.</p>
<p>The trials are <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/01/26/embryonic-stem-cells-used-to-improve-vision-of-blind-patients/\">founded on two cases</a> where the researchers successfully implanted retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells derived from embryonic stem cells into the retina. RPE cells maximize light absorption in the retina and support the neurally connected photoreceptors with a variety of nutrients. In both macular degeneration and Stargardt’s, these cells die off, thus contributing to the broader degeneration of the retina.</p>
<p>The two patients, one suffering macular degeneration and the other Stargardt’s, reported moderate visual improvement after receiving the implantation of healthy new RPE cells. Dr. Steven Schwartz, the lead researcher for the UCLA trials, <a href=\"http://today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/the-promises-of-stem-cells-247547.aspx\">says</a> stem cell therapies targeted at the RPE are the “low-hanging fruit” for stem cell therapies because they’re terminally differentiated, accessible, and form no synaptic connections.</p>
<p>Stem cell therapy isn’t the only strategy in the war. While some researchers attack blindness by refreshing the biology—other want to use cutting edge machine implants. This pair of <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/07/23/new-telescopic-contact-lens-magnifies-vision-three-times/\">telescopic contact lenses</a>, for example, or the <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/19/fda-approves-eye-implant-enabling-the-blind-to-partially-see/\">Argus II optical implant</a> (for those suffering from retinitis pigmentosa) aim to circumvent or augment the problem areas. The Argus II implant has been commercially available in Europe since 2011 (for a hefty $100,000) and was approved by the FDA here in the US earlier this year.</p>
<p>Even as researchers continue to make progress, scoring a major victory is an as yet distant goal. Ali told the <em>Guardian</em>, “”It certainly isn’t a case of rolling out treatments in five years’ time and providing therapies. It’s taken us 10 years to get here and it’ll take us five years to get started in people.”</p>

<p>Researchers led by Dr. Takanori Takebe and Dr. Hideki Taniguchi of Yokohama City University in Japan recently reported the creation of a 3D vascularized organ derived from stem cells in the journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12271.html#videos\">Nature</a>. Though it is still years away from clinical trials in humans, the approach, used to generate human liver cell buds in mice, has implications for future transplantations of liver and potentially other organs in humans.</p>
<p>Serious liver disease is typically treated by organ transplantation. However, not enough livers are available for all patients. An estimated <a href=\"http://umm.edu/programs/transplant/services/liver/living-donor\">17,000 patients</a> await liver transplantations in the US today. In 2011, <a href=\"http://srtr.transplant.hrsa.gov/annual_reports/2011/pdf/03_%20liver_12.pdf\">5,805 adult livers were transplanted</a>, but 2,938 patients either died or became ineligible for operations due to ill health while waiting.</p>
<p>Some approaches for tissue regeneration for treatment of liver disease might eventually involve new liver growth on a <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/07/15/new-livers-grown-on-scaffolds-in-rats/\">collagen scaffold</a>, and there is the exciting potential technology of <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2011/03/15/growing-human-organs-%E2%80%94-dr-anthony-atala-blows-the-minds-of-a-ted-audience/\">3D printing organs</a>. Stem cell technology, the strategy pursued by the Yokohama City University researchers, is another approach—but it isn’t without its challenges.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64973\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Stem1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64973\" alt=\"Induced pluripotent stem cells.\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Stem1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Induced pluripotent stem cells from skin.</p></div>
<p>The researchers said the major problems were going from a 2D to a 3D cellular structure and generating blood vessels to support that structure. They believed the solution involved developing precursor liver cells (hepatic cells) from somatic cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). This approach would simulate human fetal liver development and facilitate organ growth.</p>
<p>The team first reprogrammed iPSCs from the skin to express liver-like genes. Umbilical cords (containing endothelial cells) for vascular support and mesenchymal stem cells which can make bone, cartilage and fat were also included to simulate the normal cell-cell interactions that occur during embryonic liver development.</p>
<p>The scientists grew the cells in dishes in the lab (to 5 mm) for 2 months then transplanted them into mice brains to help blood vessel growth. The cells reorganized into structures that resembled those during early liver development and connected with the host’s blood vessels. This novel approach allows the tissue continued growth and use of the host’s blood system.</p>
<p>The initial results showed the tissues were also functional. Researchers gave drugs to the mice, and the liver buds broke them down as normal—indicating regular liver function. Functionality was further tested in two groups of mice with liver failure. Those treated with transplanted cells survived longer than those that were not treated.</p>
<p>These are encouraging results, but the current study has its limitations. The liver cell buds (only approx. 5 mm in diameter) have not been shown to grow large enough to support human metabolic requirements. Also, harvesting laboratory grown cells might cause damage to them before transplanting into the final host.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Takebe, human clinical trials are still approximately 10 years away. Generating a functioning liver in a single human adult would need the implantation of “tens of thousands of liver buds” and “an automated process” which “could take 5 to 7 years to design and test.” Additionally, more animal studies are needed to determine if the livers will degenerate or if tumors may form over time.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, progress in stem cell technology bodes well for future treatments that may require the replacement of dysfunctional organs and tissues in humans such as the liver, lung, pancreas and kidney. The limitations of enough compatible organs for transplantation may eventually become an issue of the past.</p>

<p>If there were a Turing test for artificial creativity (AC)—<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-konstanz.de/en/edavid/\">e-David</a> might well be on its way to passing. The robotic system, built by researchers at the University of Konstanz in Germany, employs a variety of styles to produce paintings remarkably similar to their human counterparts.</p>
<p>However, although e-David’s paintings look human, the system itself isn’t remotely creative. There is, of course, a team of researchers in the background pulling the strings. E-David’s robot arm is a standard assembly line welder; the computer is a standard computer; the camera a standard camera—the magic is in the software.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64924\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-153_1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64924 \" alt=\"SH 153_#1\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-153_1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A painting by e-David.</p></div>
<p>The robot sets down a series of brush strokes then takes a picture. E-David’s software analyzes the picture, comparing it to the image it’s trying to duplicate, and determines where to shade and color, then plans and executes a new set of brush strokes. Following each set, the system takes another picture and repeats the process, further refining the painting with each iteration.</p>
<p>E-David can work in black and white or dip its <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57593516-1/meet-e-david-the-robot-that-paints/\">five brushes</a> in a pre-mixed palette of 24 colors, cleaning them as it goes. Because the robot is using paint and brush, the process lacks minute control, and the final products seem to display that perfectly imperfect quality we generally associate with human works of art.</p>
<p>The researchers behind e-David want to push the boundaries of machine learning, but also push our definition of art: ”The results might even influence our perception of what art is—besides the imitation of existing drawing styles (imagine what Seurat would have been thinking about a robot that helped him with the millions of dots) the machine might enable new techniques since labor plays no role any more. This way very complex visual art works can be created.”</p>

<p>It’s a story as old as the Industrial Revolution itself: Progressives say pollution from factories makes people sick, and industrialists say there’s no way to link the emissions from their factories to any specific health problem.</p>
<p>Often, both sides are right: Even when pollution kills, it’s difficult, in the absence of a control group, to prove to what extent it was the cause of death. Scientists can’t ethically set up controlled studies and systematically subject participants to pollution. But they can search out and research control groups unintentionally created by government policy — which is exactly what a new study on the health effects of particulate air pollution in China has done.</p>
<p>The study, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/07/03/1300018110\">published</a> in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, took advantage of a de facto control group created by a Chinese government policy that provided free heating coal to homes and offices in northern China but not to those in southern China. (The boundary was defined by the Huai River, which lies halfway between the more famous Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, and, further inland, by the Qinling Mountain Range.)</p>
<p>The findings were dramatic.</p>
<p>Pollution in China between 1981-2000 was five times worse than it was in the United States when the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970. North of the Huai River boundary, particulate pollution was 55 percent (or 184 micrograms per cubic meter) higher, and residents had a life expectancy 5.5 years shorter than their southern neighbors. The difference was almost entirely attributable to deaths from cardiorespiratory illnesses, according to the study. The findings were even more compelling because few Chinese relocated during the period, keeping the northern and southern groups largely distinct.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/coal-home-heating_China_1997.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-64896\" alt=\"coal-home-heating_China_1997\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/coal-home-heating_China_1997.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>The researchers — Beijing-based economists Yuyu Chen, of Peking University, Hongbin Li, of Tsinghua University, Avraham Ebenstein of Israel’s Hebrew University and Michael Greenstone of MIT — used Chinese state and international pollution numbers from 1981-2000 and state public health data from 1991-2000.</p>
<p>Long-term exposure to each additional 100 micrograms per cubic meter of particulate pollution correlated with a 3-year reduction in life expectancy at birth — an estimate more than five times larger than what conventional methodologies, limited by the lack of a control group, have suggested.</p>
<p>“Everyone understands it’s unpleasant to be in a polluted place. But to be able to say with some precision what the health costs are, and what the loss of life expectancy is, puts a finer point on the importance of finding policies that balance growth with environmental quality,” <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/study-estimates-extent-to-which-air-pollution-in-china-shortens-lives-0708.html\">said</a> MIT’s Greenstone.</p>
<p>China’s gross domestic product more than doubled between 1990 and 2000, according to World Bank <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?page=2\">data</a>, as the Asian nation launched headlong into the staggering economic growth it has sustained in recent decades. While developed countries didn’t see such high pollution indicators at the time, developing countries, including China itself, have continued to see comparable levels in the present.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Chinese-Coal-Power-ed.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-64903\" alt=\"Chinese-Coal-Power-ed\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Chinese-Coal-Power-ed.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>By some accounts air pollution in Beijing, which sits well north of the Huai River, has gotten worse since 2000, even though the free coal policy is no longer in place. (One can’t make apples-to-apples comparisons between the two periods because the method of measurement has changed, according to M.I.T.’s Greenstone.) Particulate pollution remained 26 percent (or 23 micrograms per cubic meter) higher north of the Huai River in the mid- and late-2000s, suggesting that residents of northern China continue to experience shortened lifespans even as China has begun to restrict the use of coal.</p>
<p>Of course, the United States and most other developed countries moved from agrarian to industrialized economies before there were measurements of particulate pollution to contend with. That historical disparity has hamstrung the developed world’s efforts to nudge developing countries to use <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/04/30/report-energy-remains-as-dirty-as-ever-despite-rise-of-renewable-energy/\">cleaner energy</a> to blunt the effects of climate change. Chinese and Indian officials have argued in United Nations climate talks that the developed world’s unmonitored, but undeniably dirty, period of industrialization constitutes an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>The study at least attaches a caveat to that claim. With 500 million people living in northern China during the 1990s, the published numbers indicate that China has experienced a loss of more than 2.5 billion total life years as a result of the Huai River coal policy alone.</p>
<p>Greenstone hopes stronger evidence of aggressive development’s human costs might shift the terms of the debate surrounding China’s use of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The Asian nation faces greater challenges to its industrialization than its Western predecessors did. But it also has a selection of cleaner energy alternatives to choose from that have already been test-driven in Europe and the United States. While those technologies aren’t currently as cheap as free coal, <a href=\"http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56776.pdf\">prices</a> are <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/09/24/surging-solar-in-2011-proof-of-ray-kurzweils-bold-prediction/\">falling fast</a>.</p>

<p>The US Department of Defense has a good reason to fund research in advanced bionic limbs—in fact, it has a couple thousand good reasons. In the last thirteen years, <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2013/05/30.aspx\">2,000 men and women</a> have lost a limb in military service. And of course, military amputees are hardly the only amputees. Far from it.</p>
<p>Advanced prosthetic research in clinical settings is providing a ray of hope for all these folks—military or civilian—as participants in DARPA’s Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program continue to <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2013/05/30.aspx\">make progress</a> in the realm of brain-interfacing prosthetic devices.</p>
<p>Two recently released DARPA videos demonstrate just how far researchers have come. In the first video (below) a man manipulates a prosthetic arm using targeted muscle re-innervation (TMR) developed by Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. TMR allows direct manipulation of the prosthetic with thoughts alone.</p>
<p>How does it work? After a limb is amputated the nerves still fire as they once did—they just don’t lead anywhere anymore. So, soon after the amputation doctors surgically reattach severed nerve endings to different muscles in the arm.</p>
<p>The patient thinks of moving his hand, elbow, or wrist and the old nerve groups fire as normal. Now, however, they contract these new muscles. A computer learns to recognize various muscle contraction patterns as commands for particular movements of the prosthetic—‘turn wrist’, ‘close hand’, or ‘bend elbow’.</p>
<p>The technique has been used successfully in both leg and arm amputees. We wrote about another TMR patient last year, Zac Vawter, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/08/bionic-limbs-step-up-thought-controlled-prosthetic-leg-climbs-2100-stair-building/\">who climbed</a> 2,100 stairs to the top of Chicago’s Willis Tower on a TMR-controlled prosthetic leg.</p>
<p>The cool thing about the latest TMR demonstration is the complexity of motions the subject is able to employ. As he snatches a piece of cloth out of the air, he’s simultaneously bending his prosthetic elbow and closing his hand.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/-u8KkvZvVVI\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>A second demonstration shows off a flat interface nerve electrode (FINE), developed by researchers at Case Western Reserve University. FINE gives rudimentary sensory input back to an amputee. The technique is similar to TMR, but instead of sending a signal from the brain to the prosthetic, the prosthetic stimulates nerve endings to send a signal to the brain. The brain learns to interpret the stimulation as touch.</p>
<p>Being able to feel the roughness of a surface or sensing pressure can help the patient decide how hard to grip and removes the need to always be looking at an object as it’s manipulated. Perhaps the best thing about FINE (and TMR) is the procedures are minimally invasive—no cortical implant required.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/rpLzLduBGhU\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>For now, TMR and FINE are being tested separately with select patients. But in the future, one can imagine a combination of the two in a single prosthetic device—restoring touch and natural movement to those who’ve lost an arm or leg, and maybe beyond restoration, giving these future cyborgs powers they didn’t have before.</p>

<p>Researchers led by Eric Tremblay from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EDFL) in Switzerland and Joseph Ford from UC San Diego have developed a new Superman-style <a href=\"http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-21-13-15980&id=258366\">contact lens</a> that can magnify the wearer’s vision by 2.8 times when worn with a modified pair of 3D glasses.</p>
<p>Such contacts may one day empower those suffering from macular degeneration or even augment the eyes of those with perfectly healthy vision.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64846\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SuperVision_2-BIG.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64846\" alt=\"SuperVision_#2 BIG\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SuperVision_2-BIG.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"250\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Contact lens front and back views, the optomechanical test eye, and the rig with 3D glasses.</p></div>
<p>How do they work? The center of the lens allows light directly through for normal vision. Meanwhile, a 1.17 mm thick magnifying ring, located around the lens center and comprised of tiny aluminum mirrors, reflects incoming light from objects into the wearer’s retina, at which point, the image has been magnified almost three times.</p>
<p>One very cool thing about this lens is the selective magnification. The researchers used a pair of modified polarized Samsung 3D TV glasses to switch between normal (light through the central lens aperture) and magnified views (where the polarizing filters block the central lens and admit light from the mirrors).</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64858\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SuperVision_1-BIG.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64858\" alt=\"SuperVision_#1 BIG\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SuperVision_1-BIG.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"449\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Images captured through the contact lens and optomechanical eye.</p></div>
<p>This technology may help the approximately two million people in the US suffering from macular degeneration—the most common cause of blindness for individuals aged over 55 years. The macula of the eye, which deals with the visual details, slowly degenerates resulting in vision loss from the center field of vision, and the sufferer cannot recognize faces or perform simple tasks.</p>
<p>The current treatments for macular degeneration include invasive surgery or to wear glasses with very thick lenses. Although research continues, development of this new magnifying lens technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for millions of people around the world by using these ‘normal’ looking lenses.</p>
<p>Further applications might include military use to increase soldiers’ vision. (The research was originally funded by DARPA.) But there’s no reason to stop there. We could imagine a pair of these lenses being fun or useful for just about anyone. And perhaps telescopic powers are but one attribute of future contact lenses—others may include filters to see outside our normal band of the spectrum, tiny cameras, and augmented reality.</p>
<p>That said, in the foreseeable future, we’ll have to be content with just dreams of switchable x-ray contacts with telescoping lenses and onboard computers.</p>
<p>The project remains firmly in the research stage. The image quality isn’t perfect, the lenses need to be more breathable, the switchable glasses lack blink detectors, and above all, the contacts have yet to be tested on human subjects.</p>
<p>The research team is currently working with <a href=\"http://www.crtvision.com/\">Paragon Vision Sciences</a> and <a href=\"http://innovega-inc.com/\">Innovega</a> to improve lens flexibility and eye oxygenation to increase the amount of time that the lenses can be worn. According to Eric Tramblay, the next generation of lenses to be used in clinical trials is expected in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23142469\">November 2013</a>.</p>

<p>Connor Levy is proof of concept. Barely two months old, Connor is the first child born from an embryo screened with next-generation DNA sequencing techniques to ensure that his mother, Marybeth Scheidts, 36, got a genetically viable fertilized egg.  The new process is dramatically cheaper and has initially proven at least as effective as the genetic methods fertility clinics use now.</p>
<p>Dr. Dagan Wells, an Oxford University medical researcher, <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2013/130708.html\">pioneered</a> the approach that Scheidts and her husband, David Levy, 42, used to conceive Connor.</p>
<p>Wells and his team used next-generation DNA sequencing methods to screen the embryos of Scheidts and Levy, who were treated at Main Line Fertility Clinic outside Philadelphia, and another couple, who were treated at New York University’s fertility clinic and are still awaiting the birth of their child.</p>
<p>Since its introduction in the late 1970s, in vitro fertilization, or IVF, has remained an expensive last resort for those who have trouble conceiving. And even so, IVF’s <a href=\"https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?ClinicPKID=0\">success rate</a> for American women aged 35-37 is under 35 percent.</p>
<p>Many IVF embryos, produced by mixing sperm and surgically removed ova in a laboratory, suffer chromosomal abnormalities that prevent them from implanting in the uterus or developing to term. The abnormalities don’t always show up under a microscope before it’s time to implant one or several embryos.</p>
<p>Despite growing availability and <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2011/03/05/costs-of-dna-sequencing-falling-fast-look-at-these-graphs/\">falling costs</a>, next-generation sequencing methods have not been applied to IVF embryos because researchers can only safely remove a single cell from each embryo without risking destroying it.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64734\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/dagan-wells-ed.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64734\" alt=\"Dagan Wells\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/dagan-wells-ed.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dagan Wells</p></div>
<p>Wells’s team tackled that problem by sequencing the cells from multiple embryos at the same time. Researchers added short DNA tags, or “barcodes,” to the genetic material from each embryo to ensure they could connect the correct result to right embryo. They sequenced about two percent of each embryo’s genome, which is enough to determine whether it has the right number of chromosomes but insufficient to analyze specific genes.</p>
<p>The current genetic method Main Line uses, called comparative genomic hybridization, costs somewhere in the vicinity of $5,000. Wells’s method, which taps newer DNA sequencing methods developed with cost in mind, could cut the price down as low as $1,000, according to Michael Glassner, the head of the Main Line infertility division.</p>
<p>The price difference could make testing possible for many more couples.</p>
<p>“We just couldn’t afford genetic testing; it was too much money out of pocket for us. The study afforded us a better opportunity to know which embryos would actually give us a child,” Levy told Singularity Hub.</p>
<p>Levy and Scheidts found themselves in the right place at the right time to participate in the early trial of Wells’s approach. The Main Line clinic had been alerted Wells was looking for volunteers because it does a lot of genetic screening, said Glassner.</p>
<p>After several years of trying to conceive, Scheidts and Levy produced 13 embryos in their first attempt at IVF at Main Line, all of which developed normally for the first five days. Doctors knew many of the embryos would likely have genetic defects, but with all looking equally healthy under a microscope, they didn’t know which embryos to transfer to Scheidts.</p>
<p>“My wife was in the facility to do the transplant that day, and the doctor came in and said, ‘Listen, you hit the lottery,’” Levy said.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Blastocyst2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-64748\" alt=\"Blastocyst2\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Blastocyst2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>The test procedure could help make the call, and the large number of embryos would maximize the usefulness for the researchers.</p>
<p>After the couple agreed to participate in the experiment, their embryos were first subjected to conventional genetic screening (at no cost) to provide a point of comparison for Wells’s approach. The screening ruled out all but four embryos. The embryos were then shipped to Wells in the UK, where just three were deemed viable.</p>
<p>Glassner was so confident that any of the three sound embryos would result in a child that he transferred only one to Scheidts, Levy said. Fertility doctors often transfer several embryos to improve the odds that their female patients will get pregnant, but the practice often results in riskier multiple births. Pre-screening embryos can boost the chance of success from a given round of IVF by as much as half; it also reduces the chance of miscarriage by half, Glassner said.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64732\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MichaelGlassner2013-ed.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64732\" alt=\"Michael Glassner\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MichaelGlassner2013-ed.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Michael Glassner</p></div>
<p>Wells’s approach will next be tested in clinical trials. If the method holds up with a control group and larger sample size—and is eventually given the green light for wider use—it could increase the number of babies born through IVF , even as it might reduce the number of multiple births.</p>
<p>“Since this broke, we’ve had calls from all over the world from patients who want to get involved in the clinical trial. It’s made patients very aware of the genetic reality of embryos,” Glassner told Singularity Hub.</p>
<p>If more patients opted for genetic screening, the number of embryos in cryogenic storage could also drop, since few couples would opt to store those that are found nonviable. Main Line alone has 8,000 frozen embryos.</p>
<p>“They create a moral dilemma,” Glassner said.</p>
<p>Of course, another moral dilemma will be what to do with the information next-generation DNA screening can provide. The next logical use of the technology would be to reveal the chances of disease encoded in the embryos, Wells <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2013/130708.html\">says</a>, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2009/07/21/prenatal-screening-could-eradicate-genetic-disease-replace-natural-conception/\">steering parents to healthy babies</a>. Soon the door opens onto parents choosing embryos based on height, eye color and the like, Glassner said.</p>
<p>But for now, Wells’s technique realistically just shortens IVF by a few cycles and puts it within reach for more aspiring parents.</p>

<p>I liked going to the bank drive-through with my mom as a kid. She’d send her checks to the teller inside by shooting a cylinder through a pneumatic tube. I always wanted a ride in that thing. And while there remains a woeful shortage of pneumatic tubes transporting people at the moment—that unhappy state of affairs may not last forever.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, the billionaire tech mogul behind PayPal, Tesla Motors, and SpaceX and the entrepreneur who wants to <a href=\"http://www.space.com/18596-mars-colony-spacex-elon-musk.html\">colonize Mars</a> with a vertically landing, reusable rocket—that guy—recently announced he’s been busy thinking about building a pneumatic tube to shuttle people from SF to LA at 600+ mph. He calls it the Hyperloop.</p>
<p>When asked to describe the Hyperloop at D11, Musk told the audience that if the Concorde had a three-way with a railgun and an air hockey table—the Hyperloop would be their baby. Let’s pause a moment to let that analogy settle in. Pithy, colorful, a touch awkward. No writer could hope for better. (It’s like a dirty Warren Buffett quote.)</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qox_m6jyfmA\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Musk says he came up with the idea when contemplating California’s high-speed rail project between San Francisco and Los Angeles. He notes the project may produce the slowest high-speed train in the world, the most expensive per mile—and we can do better. That’s where the Hyperloop comes in. Musk modestly claims it could be the fifth mode of transportation, right up there with boats, planes, trains, and automobiles.</p>
<p>The Hyperloop would transport passengers from San Francisco to Los Angeles in about 30 minutes and at about twice the average speed of a commercial jet. The system would be on-demand, cheaper than current alternatives, impossible to crash, and potentially, run entirely on solar power. No big deal.</p>
<p>There are, of course, a few details missing from the discussion at this point. Besides some hints here and there—no one knows specifically how this thing works or exactly what it is even. Only someone of Musk’s reputation could stir up this much excitement with so little to back it up.</p>
<p>In a detailed rumination on Gizmag, Brian Dodson, a rocket scientist and physicist, <a href=\"http://www.gizmag.com/how-does-elon-musk-hyperloop-work/27757/\">hypothesizes</a> that “the Hyperloop is essentially a pneumatic transport system (PTS) in the form of a closed tube that loops between Los Angeles and San Francisco.”</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-151_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64817 alignright\" alt=\"SH 151_#2\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-151_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Travelers ride in pods magnetically accelerated and decelerated into the main tube (like a rail gun) where the air circulates at speed. The air between pods acts as a cushion, preventing crashes, while more air injected through perforations in the tube levitates the pods and reduces friction, much as it might on an air hockey table.</p>
<p>Another speculator, John Gardi, got <a href=\"https://twitter.com/John_Gardi/statuses/356798172842049536\">Musk’s blessing</a> on Twitter for his hypothetical Hyperloop design (see <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/cw4pqb\">here</a>), “Your guess is the closest I’ve seen anyone guess so far.”</p>
<p>For the record, this is <a href=\"http://io9.com/5822028/a-brief-history-of-pneumatic-tube-transport\">not, in general, a new idea</a>. Jules Verne imagined pneumatic tubes replacing trains and crossing oceans in his 1863 story <em>Paris in the Twentieth Century</em>. And remember George Jetson entering his home by tube?</p>
<p>No, not new. But this is the one of the first times someone with such credentials has actually proposed building such a machine. The first time, that is, since Alfred Ely Beach <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Pneumatic_Transit\">suggested a pneumatic subway</a> for New York in 1869, or more recently and closer to home, when LK Edwards pitched a Bay Area Gravity-Vacuum Transit system in 1967.</p>
<p>Thing is, the longer an idea lives in pop culture and science fiction, the more fringe it can seem. But that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Sometimes it’s just been waiting for the right combination of technology and cojones. And Musk has executed two giant ideas—high-performance electric cars and low-cost rocketry—in the last decade. He tends to take big concepts and make them reality in one form or another.</p>
<p>Half of me expects the Hyperloop by 2025. The other half expects Musk to sequester himself in a hotel room, forgo cutting his fingernails, and quietly retire to Earth orbit (or Mars) just as SETI receives humanity’s first message of extraterrestrial origin.</p>
<p>Whether or not the Hyperloop is Musk’s Spruce Goose remains to be seen. But I suspect we’ll be writing about it again very soon. It’s hard to ignore back-of-the-napkin musings from wild, billionaire geniuses—never mind resisting the “alpha plan” for Elon Musk’s mysterious Hyperloop.</p>

<p>The US Navy’s newest fighter is a high-tech batwing the size of an <a href=\"http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-reviews/car-comparison-tests/extreme-machines-boeing-fa-18f-super-hornet\">F/A 18 Super Hornet</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/x-47b-unmanned-combat-air-system-carrier-ucas/\">stealthy X-47B </a>can carry 4,500 pounds of weapons at half mach speed, up to 40,000 feet, and over 2,400 miles. The aircraft lacks but one thing. A cockpit. The X-47B is a next-generation military drone.</p>
<p>The X-47B is completely autonomous, and we’re not just talking the ability to fly simple missions from one airstrip to another. Recently, the X-47B <a href=\"http://www.northropgrumman.com/MediaResources/Pages/NewsArticle.aspx?art=http://www.globenewswire.com/newsarchive/noc/press/xml/nitf.html?d=10039762\">landed on an aircraft carrier</a> by algorithm alone. That’s something only elite fighter pilots have been able to do until now.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Rc2k6G8LuqY\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2013/07/future-has-arrived\">said of the X-47B’s feat,</a> “Landing the X-47B safely aboard the ship without a human operator requires a very sophisticated computer system capable of factoring in airspeed, altitude, and angle-of-attack to a pitching, rolling flight deck, not to mention the changing winds and seas.”</p>
<p>The carrier landing was historic for the Navy, maybe equally so for robots and artificial intelligence. But it wasn’t all roses.</p>
<p>After two successful touchdowns, the first of two X-47B drones flying under the call sign, Salty Dog 502, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/navy-scrubs-4th-drone-carrier-landing-attempt-after-problem-detected-ends-carrier-based-test/2013/07/16/cda44248-ee62-11e2-bb32-725c8351a69e_story.html\">scrubbed a third attempt</a> after its flight computer failed. The second drone, Salty Dog 501, aborted a fourth attempt a few days later.</p>
<p>From one perspective, that’s a touch worrisome.</p>
<p>Glitchy computers are the last thing you want as a multi-million dollar fighter jet attempts a tight landing with personnel and expensive equipment in jeopardy. On the other hand, that the X-47B’s handlers were able to reroute the aircraft to a safe landing onshore demonstrates the aircraft’s built-in redundancy is capable of handling equipment failures.</p>
<p>And of course, the aircraft itself is still experimental. The Navy was aiming for three successful landings but was satisfied that just the first two provided enough information to move forward.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64697\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-150_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64697 \" alt=\"X-47B, Salty Dog 502, autonomously touches down on aircraft carrier.\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-150_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">X-47B, call sign Salty Dog 502, autonomously touches down on aircraft carrier, USS George H.W. Bush.</p></div>
<p>The eight-year-old, $1.4 billion X-47B was developed by <a href=\"http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/X47BUCAS/Pages/default.aspx\">Northrop Grumman</a> and has so far fulfilled the Navy’s requirements <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2013/07/future-has-arrived\">on budget and on time</a>—a remarkable achievement in itself.</p>
<p>Though these demonstrator aircraft aren’t destined for Navy service, future generations will take to the air inside the next decade.</p>
<p>Is this technology terrific or terrifying? It depends on who you are, or more specifically, where you are. If the Predator and Reaper drones were grim assassins, the X-47B is the ninja to their karate.</p>
<p>On an aircraft carrier, and with future in-air refueling, an X-47B drone’s strike range will be nothing less than the world. At the same time, removing the pilot from the equation radically changes what the aircraft can do.</p>
<p>Mabus again, “Not only will the future carrier air wing be more combat effective, they will cost less to build, and less expensive airframes mean we can build more and use them differently, like developing swarm tactics and performing maneuvers that require more g-force than a human body can withstand.”</p>
<p>If you just got chills imagining heavily armed robot fighter jets performing high-g swarm tactics—you wouldn’t be alone. That is some serious stuff.</p>
<p>And the US isn’t the only one developing robot fighters. A little while back we covered the <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/11/fearsome-uk-robot-aircraft-is-semi-autonomous-and-will-fly-in-2013/\">UK’s Taranis superdrone</a>. It’s not landing on carriers yet, but it will be mostly autonomous, fully stealthy, and capable of supersonic flight.</p>
<p>More autonomous military aircraft means fewer humans in harm’s way. But as control is handed over to algorithms, it also means we’ll need to develop a new code of ethics governing autonomous killer machines. The concern is real enough to have prompted the US military to <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/12/19/killer-robots-are-coming-ai-experts-to-determine-their-threat-toward-humanity/\">pen a directive</a> outlining its “only humans pull the trigger” policy.</p>
<p>Whatever your stance, there’s no denying robots—from drones to <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/04/07/human-or-robot-harder-to-tell-in-latest-bipedal-robot-petman-video/\">bipedal</a> and <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/02/09/boston-dynamics-takes-alpha-dog-military-robot-out-for-its-first-walk/\">four-legged</a> bots—are the future of warfare.</p>

<p>In June, at the 2013 International AIDS Society conference, Dr. Tim Henrich made an extraordinary announcement (13:50 in the video below). Two HIV positive cancer patients are now HIV-free four years after undergoing bone-marrow transplants. Though Henrich was hesitant to declare a full victory, as the virus may yet reemerge—it’s a hopeful bit of news and another clue in the long and vexing search for a cure.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/1tFA9-Ri-V4\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>The beginning of this story <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/12/22/man-cured-of-hiv-using-stem-cells-fluke-or-hope/\">dates back to 2009</a>, when researchers made a similar announcement about a different subject. Widely known as the Berlin patient, Timothy Brown had been given two bone marrow transplants to rebuild his immune system after undergoing extensive chemotherapy and radiation to combat leukemia.</p>
<p>The transplants contained stem cells from a donor with an HIV-resistant genetic mutation called delta 32. The cellular receptor, CCR5, is the gateway through which HIV invades white blood cells. Men and women with the delta 32 mutation, around 1% of the population, lack the CCR5 receptor and are therefore resistant to most forms of HIV.</p>
<p>Remarkably, Brown not only survived leukemia and three rounds of chemo, but he emerged HIV-free. Researchers were careful to look anywhere the virus might be hiding, even taking brain and spinal fluid samples.</p>
<p>Five years on, the virus is, quite simply, gone.</p>
<p>Brown’s case verges on the miraculous, beating both AIDS and cancer—at the same time. And it was thought the rare delta 32 mutation was a necessary ingredient. But if verified, the Boston cases may show anti-retroviral drugs are just as effective.</p>
<p>In contrast to Brown, both Boston patients suffered from lymphoma, not leukemia. Each underwent a more moderate round of cancer therapy and needed a less complete bone marrow transplant. Critically, neither received stem cells with the delta 32 mutation, but both remained on anti-retrovirals during the transplant and for some years thereafter.</p>
<p>Then recently, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/health/post-transplant-and-off-drugs-hiv-patients-are-apparently-virus-free.html?_r=0\">following months of tests</a> to confirm the virus was still missing in action, the patients’ doctors took them off the anti-retroviral drugs. Seven weeks and fifteen weeks on, respectively—there’s still no sign of HIV.</p>
<p>How do researchers explain the result?</p>
<p>Brown’s immune system was so compromised, he couldn’t continue anti-retrovirals. But the stem cells with the delta 32 mutation kept the virus from spreading while simultaneously targeting and destroying the few remaining HIV-infected cells.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64599\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-147_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64599\" alt=\"HIV infected T cell.\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-147_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">An HIV infected T cell.</p></div>
<p>Though the Boston patients weren’t given stem cells with the delta 32 mutation, they were healthy enough to continue a course of anti-retrovirals. The drugs may have mimicked the cells with the delta 32 mutation by preventing the virus from spreading. Meanwhile, healthy new cells from the bone-marrow transplant eradicated the old, weakened HIV-infected cells—and every remaining virus along with them.</p>
<p>The finding offers a ray of hope for those suffering from the disease. The Boston cases show less destructive therapy may yield similar results to those achieved by Brown. Indeed, while Brown still suffers weakness and pain from his treatment, the Boston patients reportedly “feel great and are leading completely normal lives.”</p>
<p>Researchers remain only cautiously optimistic, noting that, generally, the virus can reemerge after 50 days—or about the length of time the patients have been off anti-retroviral drugs—but it can also take longer, up to six months or a year. Though the results so far are promising, they’ll withhold final judgment for awhile yet.</p>
<p>And even if, like Brown, the patients do remain HIV-free, the procedure won’t likely be replicated terribly often. Bone-marrow transplants and anti-retroviral drug therapy require access to top (expensive) medical care and a donor match for the stem cells.</p>
<p>Further, bone-marrow transplants <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/health/post-transplant-and-off-drugs-hiv-patients-are-apparently-virus-free.html?_r=0\">are very risky</a>. A third Boston patient died in treatment, and in general, there is a 15 to 20 percent risk of death. Brown’s procedure carried a 40 percent risk of death.</p>
<p>In an age when the right drug cocktail can make life livable for folks with HIV, the only <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/health/post-transplant-and-off-drugs-hiv-patients-are-apparently-virus-free.html?_r=0\">ethical candidates</a> for the treatment would be those who are diagnosed with cancer as well as HIV—not exactly a cure for the masses. Not yet, at least.</p>

<p>A better understanding of the brain may help us better understand thought, behavior and neurological disorders. An improved tool to facilitate this—a new 3D map of the human brain—has recently been released. It’s hoped the map might reveal novel insights into brain function and perhaps help find cures for related diseases.</p>
<p>The new 3D map, called <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/science/3-d-map-of-human-brain-gives-unprecedented-detail.html\">BigBrain</a>, was developed by researchers from Germany and Canada and is 50 times more detailed than previous brain maps. In the past, atlases of the brain were limited by MRI resolution which was about one millimeter. But BigBrain has a resolution of under 20 microns, or thinner than a human hair.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/nJpFvQ0YZLk\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>As you might expect, it was no simple matter getting that kind of resolution.</p>
<p>“First, the brain was scanned using a magnetic resonance scanner then imbedded into paraffin and then cut with a microtome for large sections into more than 7,400 sections,” <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2013/06/20/340.6139.1479-b.DC1/SciencePodcast_130621.pdf\">Katrin Amunts</a> of the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine in Jülich, Germany told Sciencemag.org. After sectioning the brain, researchers began the time and labor intensive process of section imaging, cell body staining, digital removal of anomalies and the precise reconstruction of the brain sections to create a final 3D image.</p>
<p>The finished brain atlas will serve as a detailed reference and provide scientists their closest look at brain structures associated with processes such as disease, cognition and emotion. It is also hoped that BigBrain will help integrate the increasing molecular and genetic data being generated.</p>
<p>Though BigBrain was built from one person—a deceased 65-year-old woman—the team hopes to generate more models in the future to better represent brain-to-brain structural variability.</p>
<p>BigBrain is part of the European Human Brain Project. The Human Brain Project was funded earlier in 2013, receiving a staggering <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/26/quest-to-model-the-human-brain-nets-a-billion-euros/\">one billion Euros</a> over 10 years from the European Commission. This collaborative project involves 80 institutions, seeks to map the connections of the human brain, and eventually simulate an entire brain digitally.</p>
<p>More recently, the Obama administration launched the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/infographics/brain-initiative\">BRAIN Initiative</a>—or Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies and also commonly referred to as the Brain Activity Map Project—to chart the activity of each of the 100 billion neurons in the human brain. This initiative, based upon the Human Genome Project, has secured funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and DARPA ($110 million) and private research institutes including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, HHMI, the Salk Institute and the Kavli Foundation ($122 million) so far.</p>
<p>Although BigBrain does not reveal gene expression differences or brain connectivity as in the other major ongoing projects, it is a technological advance that can be immediately used by researchers everywhere while the other well-funded projects are progressing. Furthermore, it may eventually be used together with the other projects for more realistic brain modeling and simulation.</p>
<p>The large amounts of money invested in these new research approaches for the brain are very encouraging and promise much in terms of advancing treatments for brain diseases—a critical area made even more important in light of our aging population and increasing rates of associated diseases.</p>

<p>Many of the themes explored in this presentation were derived from the observations and articles created while I worked at Singularity Hub.

These same ideas, however, are far from ordinary to the majority of our 21<sup>st</sup> Century peers, which is why it was so rewarding to see how well my silly little robot presentation was received by the BAASICS audience.</p>
<p>BAASICS, now in its third year, is an ongoing effort to bridge the gap between science and the arts with colorful presentations, performances, and discussions — all provided for free to the San Francisco, and online, community. Like the juggernaut TED conference or the more indy BIL conference, BAASICS seeks to fire imaginations while informing attendees about the wondrous natural and technical world around them. Produced by Selene Foster and Christopher Reiger, BAASICS is an organization worth watching as online video continues to develop as a powerful tool to connect local innovators with global audiences.</p>
<p>As a prediction of the future, my presentation on robot overlords has little chance of standing the test of time. Even now, barely a year later, the statistics I quote and the examples I use seem outdated. Foxconn is well underway with <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/2043026/foxconn-to-speed-up-robot-army-deployment-20000-robots-already-in-its-factories.html\">its march towards a million industrial robots</a>, and <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/category/robot-robotics/\">the latest wave of research quality machines are smarter, faster, and more creative than ever</a>. If automation continues at this pace, I’ll soon be outdistanced by the reality of robotics.</p>
<p>It’s not the winner of the race, however, that really matters – it’s the destination. Whether it takes us a few decades or a few centuries, humanity should eventually arrive at a world where machines do the majority of the work, both physical and intellectual. Creativity — our last best hope for a human skill impervious to robotic emulation — is already showing signs of invasion. I’ll concede all my other points but this one: the future of labor belongs to machines. It’s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>As a people then, the only real question remaining to us is the big question I presented at BAASICS: when the robots take over, what will they be like?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the optimist in me, maybe I’ve watched too many Kurzweil videos, or read too many tech articles online, but I think those robots will be, in part or whole, an extension of us. Homo sapiens are a species with a deeply symbiotic relationship with technology and I see no reason why that relationship would cease simply because the technology becomes more advanced. We may change, perhaps beyond all present recognition, but that bond between man and machine seems unbreakable.</p>
<p>In my own humble opinion, which I will peddle online, in person, and wherever else they let me speak, the future of automation is just another phase of humanity waiting to unveil itself. I have seen the robot overlords, and they are us.</p>

Foxconn is well underway with <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/2043026/foxconn-to-speed-up-robot-army-deployment-20000-robots-already-in-its-factories.html\">its march towards a million industrial robots</a>, and <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/category/robot-robotics/\">the latest wave of research quality machines are smarter, faster, and more creative than ever</a>. If automation continues at this pace, I’ll soon be outdistanced by the reality of robotics.</p>
<p>It’s not the winner of the race, however, that really matters – it’s the destination. Whether it takes us a few decades or a few centuries, humanity should eventually arrive at a world where machines do the majority of the work, both physical and intellectual. Creativity — our last best hope for a human skill impervious to robotic emulation — is already showing signs of invasion. I’ll concede all my other points but this one: the future of labor belongs to machines. It’s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>As a people then, the only real question remaining to us is the big question I presented at BAASICS: when the robots take over, what will they be like?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the optimist in me, maybe I’ve watched too many Kurzweil videos, or read too many tech articles online, but I think those robots will be, in part or whole, an extension of us. Homo sapiens are a species with a deeply symbiotic relationship with technology and I see no reason why that relationship would cease simply because the technology becomes more advanced. We may change, perhaps beyond all present recognition, but that bond between man and machine seems unbreakable.</p>
<p>In my own humble opinion, which I will peddle online, in person, and wherever else they let me speak, the future of automation is just another phase of humanity waiting to unveil itself. I have seen the robot overlords, and they are us.</p>

<p>The solar-powered plane, <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/multimedia/educational-material/\">Solar Impulse</a>, recently touched down at New York’s JFK after flying the final leg of its journey across the US. The trip, a decade in the making, was itself but another step on the Solar Impulse team’s quest to fly around the world on solar power alone, and ultimately, to realize the dream of perpetual flight with no fuel.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/_q-UH1xAUdI?list=PL-tY-9eGABwxPrlhhkJem5jFN3ZdLq0sE\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Solar Impulse flew from San Francisco to Phoenix, Dallas, St. Louis, and Washington DC on its way to NYC. In each city, the team organized an event to show off their plane, proselytize, and chat with local and national politicians and celebrities. The aircraft performed admirably until the tour’s final leg, when an <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/37994-solar-plane-completes-cross-country-flight.html\">eight-foot tear</a> in the fabric under the wing forced the pilot to land a few hours earlier than planned.</p>
<p>Given the experimental nature of the technology, the team took heart the prime issue was a relatively simple fix.</p>
<p>Though Solar Impulse is neither the first plane to fly under solar power, nor the first such machine to cross the US—it may be the best demonstration of solar flight to date. The aircraft holds <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/pdf/edu/en/fiche_11_en.pdf \">three world records</a> for manned solar-powered flight, including the highest flight (30,300 ft), the longest flight (26 hours), and the farthest flight (693 miles). Crucially, the plane is capable of flying overnight, relying entirely on batteries charged by the sun.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64426\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-146_3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64426\" alt=\"Solar Impulse co-founder, Bertand Piccard, celebrates his plane's maiden voyage.\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-146_3.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Solar Impulse co-founder, Bertand Piccard, celebrates the plane’s maiden voyage.</p></div>
<p>The Solar Impulse project, first launched in 2003, commenced building in 2008, and the team completed their prototype mid-2009. Although the plane is blanketed in close to 11,000 solar cells and over a quarter of the aircraft’s mass goes to energy storage in its lithium batteries—the aircraft’s four engines knock out a mere 40 horsepower.</p>
<p>To make up for the weight of the batteries, engineers built the 21-meter fuselage <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/pdf/edu/en/fiche_4_en.pdf \">using carbon fiber</a> and further lightened the load with bolts and screws made of Solvay PrimoSpire, an ultra-light plastic as hard as metal.</p>
<p>Solar Impulse’s wings are <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/pdf/edu/en/fiche_3_en.pdf \">as long as</a> an Airbus A340, but the plane’s total weight is a mere 3,527 lbs—or a little more than a Porsche 911. Because the rest of the construction is so light, the aircraft is able to take off and fly under its own power, day or night. But even so, the plane’s average ground speed on the DC to NYC flight was a <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/\">sluggish 16 mph</a>. The trip took 18 hours, 23 minutes.</p>
<p>After wading through the project’s epic webpage—rife with references to Jules Verne, the Wright Brothers, Charles Lindbergh, and Chuck Yeager—you might at first be underwhelmed by the technology itself.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s solar powered, but it takes six times longer than Amtrak to go from Washington to New York. It’s hard to imagine a solar-powered aircraft replacing commercial airliners, the worst polluters in the air, anytime soon. The optimized Solar Impulse barely accommodates the weight of one passenger—never mind several hundred with luggage in tow.</p>
<p>Of course, the Wright brothers’ first prototype didn’t hint at commercial airlines or military jets. Perhaps better battery technology, more efficient solar panels, and radical new building materials and methods will subtract weight and add power and speed. (Maybe!)</p>
<p>But the likelier benefit? Folks will find other applications for solar flight. How about using a fleet of solar drones to replace expensive satellite infrastructure? Like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/loon/\">Google Loon</a>, minus the balloons. Or might an aircraft that can circle the globe without fuel be useful for reconnaissance? Sure! The technology has potential—even if the delivery is slightly overdone.</p>

<p>NASA recently <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-s-polar-robotic-ranger-passes-first-greenland-test/\">concluded</a> a successful six-week test of a prototype polar rover near the highest point in Greenland, where the robotic vehicle traversed icy terrain in temperatures of minus 30 Celsius to help scientists learn more about how ice sheets are faring in the changing climate — without having to break for hot cocoa.</p>
<p>Greenland’s ice sheets are an important area of research because if they melt, the Earth will reflect less of the sun’s energy and warm more quickly.</p>
<p>The rover — dubbed GROVER, for Goddard Remote Operated Vehicle for Exploration and Research or simply Greenland Rover — was first developed by engineering students who participated in Goddard Flight Center’s boot camp in 2010 and 2011. NASA has subsequently funded fine-tuning of the vehicle at Boise State University under the guidance of geoscientist Hans-Peter Marshall.</p>
<p>The students approached Goddard glaciologist Lora Koenig about building a robot that would assist her in her research on Greenland’s ice sheets.</p>
<p>“How it came to me as the scientist involved is the engineers came to me and said, ‘Hey, we want to build a robot, do you have any science that a robot could do?’ And I said, ‘Well, yes, actually I do,’” Koenig said in a NASA video about the project:</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CFNQK8wSykA\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Glaciologists use radar to gather data about the thickness and topography of the superimposed layers of snow and ice in an ice sheet. Currently, radar devices are mounted on aircraft or on snowmobiles that scientists operate themselves.</p>
<p>A robotic rover that withstands arctic temperatures and moves across icy, uneven terrain would cost less than using aircraft and pollute pristine natural places less than gas-powered aircraft or snowmobiles do.</p>
<p>It would also spare scientists like Koenig hours of grueling exposure while also covering more ground in a day.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GROVER-NASA-ICE.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-64499\" alt=\"GROVER-NASA-ICE\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GROVER-NASA-ICE.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>“When we’re on snowmobiles, we can get 50 to 75 kilometers in a day. You get cold, and you need to stop for the day. GROVER will go slower than we would with snowmobiles, but when it goes for 24 hours, which a human can’t, it will actually gather more data for us,” Koenig explained.</p>
<p>GROVER, a six-foot tall, 800-pound vehicle that moves on a set of repurposed snowmobile tracks, uses solar panels to power a pair of rechargeable batteries that run its radar and telecommunications devices. Because the sun never dips below the horizon in the arctic summer, the engineers had hoped the rover would be able to operate all day and night.</p>
<p>But in Greenland’s frigid temperatures, GROVER’s batteries drained faster and took longer to recharge than expected. Electronics also took longer to reboot. In the end, the robotic vehicle operated for 12 hours a day, rather than the hoped-for 24.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GROVER-NASA-ICE-scientist.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-64502\" alt=\"GROVER-NASA-ICE-scientist\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GROVER-NASA-ICE-scientist.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>“This is very common the first time you take an instrument into an environment like Greenland. It’s always more challenging than you thought it was going to be,” <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-s-polar-robotic-ranger-passes-first-greenland-test/\">said</a> Boise State’s Marshall.</p>
<p>The researchers also had to continually tinker with the rover’s speed to prevent it from getting stuck in the snow and ice.</p>
<p>Still, GROVER’s data was good. It was able to collect measurements of the ice sheet that were detailed enough to isolate the melt layer that resulted from Greenland’s record high temperatures in 2012, one of the trial’s objectives.</p>
<p>GROVER joins the growing population of <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/09/11/liquid-robotics-aims-to-usher-in-era-of-smart-oceans-with-autonomous-robots/\">Earth-sensing robots</a> that are taking more measurements, more often, in more remote places. These <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/12/distributed-network-of-3000-ocean-robots-argo-notches-millionth-data-point/\">robots are casting</a> an ever widening net of observation, supplying scientific models with rich data sets, and deepening our understanding of Earth’s natural processes.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/18/learning-to-learn-faster-the-one-superpower-everyone-needs/\">In my last blog</a>, we got a chance to meet learning expert <a href=\"http://jimkwik.com/\">Jim Kwik</a> and explored some of the ideas behind <a href=\"http://superheroyou.com/\">SuperheroYou,</a> which is the Kwik-founded open-source community/university devoted to accelerated learning and brain optimization.</p>
<p>In May of this year, Kwik and SuperheroYou teamed up with <a href=\"http://about.zappos.com/meet-our-monkeys/tony-hsieh-ceo\">Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh</a> and the <a href=\"http://downtownproject.com/\">Downtown Vegas project</a> to host a super-learning super-summit in, of course, downtown Las Vegas. It was a best-of-the-best gathering. Kwik sought out an assembled a collection of extraordinary minds to share their high performance learning hacks.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenkotler/2013/06/02/learning-to-learn-faster-the-one-superpower-everyone-needs/\">In the last post,</a> we covered a small example of exactly this kind of brain optimizing hack: novelty. Our brains crave novelty. As a result, if you are trying to remember where you put your car keys, having an image of them 60 feet tall and dressed in drag helps. Mental exaggeration is a simple learning hack—a way of using the brain’s fundamental attraction to novelty as a way to optimize memory.</p>
<p>In this post, we’re going to examine a couple of similar tricks, one as a way to hack speed reading; the second as a way to accelerate problem solving, but before we can get into those details, first the “fish story.”</p>
<p>The fish story goes like this: A while back, Jim Kwik bumped into one of his old speed reading students (again, for more on Kwik and his reading talents, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/18/learning-to-learn-faster-the-one-superpower-everyone-needs/\">see my previous post</a>) who told him he had just reread one of his favorite books using Kwik’s techniques.</p>
<p>The book in question was Hemingway’s classic <em>The Old Man and the Sea. </em>What had surprised the student the second time through was the vividness of the experience.</p>
<p>“He said he could feel the hot sun beating down on his shoulders as he read,” explains Kwik. “That he could actually hear the sound of the waves crash. It was amazing, he loved the whole book,  except what he really couldn’t deal with was the smell of the fish.”</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old-man-and-the-sea.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64442\" alt=\"old man and the sea\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old-man-and-the-sea.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>
<p>Where this fish smell comes from and what it has to do with accelerated learning is where this fish story gets interesting—but before we can get there we have to first cover a few speed reading techniques.</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Kwik has discovered a few key reasons why most people read slowly, with back-skipping (re-reading passages over and again) and lack of focus among the most common.</p>
<p>The easiest way to solve these problems? Use a visual pacer. Your finger, a pencil, a computer mouse, whatever. This works so well because of another fundamental neuronal process: our eyes are attracted to motion.</p>
<p>We evolved in a world when a tiny rustle in the bush could have meant predator or could have been prey, but either way it paid to pay attention. So we do. We can’t help it.  Which is why simply the use of a visual pacer improves reading speeds by 25 percent.</p>
<p>But Kwik tells his students to either use their left finger for that pacer; or hold that pacer (i.e. a pencil) with their left hand—and that’s where this story gets interesting.</p>
<p>Here’s why: The left side of the body is controlled by the right side of the brain. While brain function is not evenly lateralized, the right side is far more creative than the left. When we control a pacer with our left hand, we are actively engaging these same creative process. It happens subconsciously, it happens automatically, but by engaging the right side of the brain we’re firing up the imagination which, in turn, fires us sense memory—which is why that student smelled fish.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing—the more we engage imagination to process information, the more vivid the real time experience of that information, and the much more likely we’re able to recall that data later.</p>
<p>Simply by using our left finger as a visual pacer we are using the brain’s own inner workings to our advantage. In a very real sense, we’re hacking the subconscious with the subconscious—and the result is extreme vivid and detailed recall.</p>
<p>Another presenter at the SuperheroYou Downtown Vegas summit was longtime television writer Lee Zlotoff, who has developed a problem-solving method that also involves hacking the subconscious with the subconscious.</p>
<p>He calls it the <a href=\"http://macgyvermethod.com/\">MacGyver Method.</a> MacGyver, you might remember, was an excellent problem solver. Zlotoff, meanwhile, who created MacGyver, had to become an excellent problem solver. It goes with the territory.</p>
<p>“To write episodic TV,” explains Zlotoff, “I had to produce an enormous amount of creative material, under very tight deadlines. There was no time to get stuck.”</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/gaDInuYw98k?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>After years of this work, Zlotoff noticed that whenever he did get stuck, the answers he sought never appeared up in obvious places—like when he was sitting at his desk plugging away at the problem. Rather, he always got his answers when driving or taking a shower. In fact, it happened so frequently that whenever Zlotoff got stuck he had started leaving his office so he could drive home and take a shower.</p>
<p>Eventually, Zlotoff decided to figure out why this was happening. What he discovered is the true power of the subconscious. “We have this idea,” he says, that because we use our conscious mind all day long, it’s actually more powerful than the subconscious. Nothing could be farther from the truth. <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=understanding-consciousness-measure-more-argue-less\">The subconscious is so much bigger and deeper and more capable than the conscious mind—even the comparisons get ridiculous</a>.”</p>
<p>Zlotoff points to two classic studies to make his case. The first, run by Stanford cell biologist Bruce Lipton, determined that the conscious mind processes roughly 40 bits of information a second.</p>
<p>The subconscious, though, can handle 20 million bits of information a second.</p>
<p>The second study, run at the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/colleges/university-of-pennsylvania/\">University of Pennsylvania</a>, was an attempt to verify the first. There researchers found Lipton’s figures were slightly conservative. By their calculations, the conscious mind could handle about 2,000 bits of data a second. And the subconscious? Some 400 billion.</p>
<p>More astounding, the Penn team clocked processing speeds. The conscious mind solves problems at roughly 100-150 miles-per-hour. Meanwhile, our subconscious blazes away at close to 100,000 m.p.h.</p>
<p>“Even if this research is off by a factor of 100,” says Zlotoff, “this still means the subconscious mind is 5000 to 2 million times faster than the conscious.”</p>
<p>This is also why taking a shower or driving a car is such an effective problem solving hack. When we engage in lightly stimulating activity—activity that requires mental processing, but not too much of it—we are occupying the conscious mind with a task, and allowing the subconscious mind to take over information processing responsibilities.</p>
<p>The period that the subconscious can process a problem without conscious interference is called the “the incubation period,” and knowing how to utilize it properly is core to Zlotoff’s MacGyver Method.</p>
<p>The method has three steps—let’s take a closer look:</p>
<blockquote><p>Step one: Write down your problem. Literally. Speaking it aloud won’t work. Telling a friend doesn’t help. Writing seems the key (why no one is yet certain). Be as detailed as possible, but don’t worry so much about connective tissue.</p>
<p>Step Two: Incubation. Step away from the problem for 1-4 hours (beginners might want to wait a half-day). During this period do something stimulating, but not taxing. Zlotoff, for example, builds models. Gardening, house cleaning, shooting basketballs all work fine. What doesn’t work is TV or video-game playing or reading—all require too much mental processing to do the trick.</p>
<p>Step Three: Sit back down at your notepad and start writing. It doesn’t matter what. Copy passages out of your favorite book, pen song lyrics, doesn’t matter. After a short delay—usually no more than a minute or two—the answers to your problems will start pouring out of you.</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds simple, but the results are stunning.</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve been using a similar method for a few years and have seen it improve my writing speeds by at least 15 percent.  Zlotoff, whose method is more precise than the one I was using, has seen bigger speed gains, to say nothing of downstream emotional benefits.</p>
<p>“I never have to worry about a problem. If I get stuck, I know my subconscious can come up with answers my conscious mind literally can’t dream of, and in far shorter time frames. It’s totally removed anxiety from my writing process.”</p>
<p>More formally, psychologists at the University of Michigan have been putting the MacGyver method through its paces, and while the data has yet to be formally released the early results are exceptionally promising.</p>

<p>Your connectome, the map of all 86 billion connected neurons in your brain, is hopelessly complex. In fact, one human connectome has a staggering 10,000 times that number of neural pathways. Every thought you have and every memory you hold exists in your connectome, and major efforts are under way to map it.</p>
<p>The good news is that you don’t need a fancy neuroscience degree to help out. In fact, the fancy degreed neuroscientists are hoping that you might pitch in.</p>
<p>Created by scientists at MIT, <a href=\"http://eyewire.org/\">Eyewire is a browser game</a> that lets players take on the challenge of mapping neural pathways in brains — no scientific background required. By playing, gamers are not only mapping neurons, but also training artificial intelligence algorithms to better understand how to map neurons themselves, what Amy Robinson, Creative Director at Eyewire, calls “augmented intelligence”. The more that gamers play, the better the computers get.</p>
<p>In an amplifying way, the team at MIT hopes that these human assisted computers will one day learn to map neurons by themselves.</p>
<p>To date, over 70,000 gamers from over 100 countries have signed up to play Eyewire, and it’s a good thing they did. Using today’s state of the art technology, it takes an AI-assisted researcher almost 50 hours to reconstruct a SINGLE neuron! At that pace, one researcher would need to devote the next 50 million years to neural mapping; no bathroom breaks allowed. Thankfully, there is one thing that technology does consistently overly time, which is improve.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/hpSA3_ZFWB0?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Today our technology improves at the speed of Moore’s Law, and <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/10/leading-neuroscientist-says-kurzweil-singularity-prediction-a-bunch-of-hot-air/\">those who study that exponential growth, like Ray Kurzweil</a>, contend that we will not only map the brain in our lifetime, but are only a decade away from doing so. Such ambitious claims are certain to give a neuroscientist the same knee jerk reaction that life scientists had when similar early claims were made about sequencing human genomes.</p>
<p>Five years into the Human Genome Project, it was considered a failure since scientists had completed only 1% of the sequence. Somehow five years after that it was finished. That’s because early on, scientists were required to sequence the genome in linear order. Then, exponentially more powerful computers enabled what’s known as shotgun sequencing, a process that allowed scientists to sequence random strands while computers put those strands back in order; a much faster and simpler process. Better technologies have always improved ways of advancing research.</p>
<p>Mapping the connectome will be considerably more challenging than mapping the genome, but the lesson learned holds true. The key to mapping the connectome will be new technologies and innovative ways of using them.</p>
<p>The team at Eyewire understands this. With their platform, they are enabling a community of citizen scientists who contribute to breakthrough research; something previously restricted to degree holding academics. Additionally, they are leveraging the innate human desire to compete and play games. Considering that as a planet, we spend 3 billion hours playing videogames every week, imagine what can be accomplished when even a portion of that time is allocated to things like neural discovery?</p>
<p>The importance of mapping the brain cannot be overstated. Around the planet, we’re facing an increased prevalence of dementia, mood disorders, and other cognitive disease – an issue that hasn’t gone unnoticed by world leaders. Earlier this year the European Union awarded the <a href=\"http://www.humanbrainproject.eu\">Human Brain Project</a> $1.3 Billion over the next ten years while President Obama similarly pledged $100 million of his 2014 fiscal budget to, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/04/02/fact-sheet-brain-initiative\">Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies</a>, or BRAIN as the project is known.</p>
<p>The post brain mapped world will look nothing like the world of today. A functionally accurate brain map forever changes the equation for everything from medicine to human performance. Cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s and depression might one day be curable, while brain augmentation through cognitive implants could become commonplace.</p>
<p>At some unforeseen point in the future, researchers will peer into the brain at the resolution of individual synapses and understand what’s happening. In order to get there, scientists must uncover innovative ways of advancing brain science. The supercomputers of the future are a likely candidate to reconstruct all those neurons, but for now they’ll continue to study at the side of Eyewire’s community of scientist gamers.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, kids participated in the space race by launching homemade rockets a few hundred feet in the air. With the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1677943140/send-your-own-pocket-spacecraft-on-a-mission-to-th\">Pocket Spacecraft Kickstarter</a>, space fans may send their very own personal spacecraft to the Moon for as little as £199 (about $300) or £39 (about $60) to share their voyage with 20 other lunar-tics.</p>
<p>The spacecraft (or Scouts) are tiny polyimide discs—three inches across, weighing about a gram, and as thin as a piece of paper—but they’ll carry solar cells for power, a miniature computer, sensor suite, and radio antenna printed on or affixed to the surface.</p>
<p>In fact, each Scout boasts “computing power comparable to that of the Voyager spacecraft and Apollo flight computers.”</p>
<p>Participants will be able to track the progress of their spacecraft on a mission control smartphone app—including an augmented reality function whereby the user points their device at the sky to find their Scout.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/69326668?byline=0&portrait=0&color=ffffff\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Beyond going to the Moon, Pocket Spacecraft hopes their Scouts are able to survive reentry and land on a planet with an atmosphere like the Earth (or Mars, or Venus, or wherever!). Though the Scouts’ capability pales in comparison to the likes of one of NASA’s Mars rovers, they could potentially record basic data like magnetic field, temperature, or pressure and send these observations back home.</p>
<p>If funded, Kickstarters will design and test their custom spacecraft over 18 months. The finished Scouts will be loaded into a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat\">3U CubeSat</a> mothership and sent into Earth orbit on a commercial rocket.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64307\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-145_1-BIG.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64307\" alt=\"SH 145_#1 BIG\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-145_1-BIG.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"246\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">3U CubeSat.</p></div>
<p>From orbit, phase one of the mission will send a batch of Scouts back to Earth to prove them resistant to the rigors of reentry. (And to inspire a treasure hunt to find the fallen Scouts.) The mothership will then deploy a solar sail or fire up a solar-powered electrolysis propulsion system to slingshot it around the Earth to the Moon. From lunar orbit, the ship will send the remaining Scouts to the Moon’s surface.</p>
<p>We <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/23/tiny-cubesat-satellites-spur-revolution-in-space/\">recently wrote</a> about how CubeSats are democratizing space at a furious pace. Now, <a href=\"http://www.space.com/17273-tiny-lunarcubes-spacecraft-moon-exploration.html\">there’s a push</a> to move CubeSats beyond Earth orbit. If successful, the Pocket Spacecraft Kickstarter could be a pathfinder for interplanetary CubeSats and one of the first crowdfunded small satellites to go to another celestial body.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64308\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-145_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64308\" alt=\"Polyimide substrate with a penny for scale.\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-145_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Polyimide substrate with a penny for scale.</p></div>
<p>It’s an ambitious project, to be sure, but the project’s goals are plausible. CubeSat technology is maturing fast and continues to be tested in Earth orbit. And the team behind Pocket Spacecraft is experienced. Several team members worked on the early CubeSat Kickstarter, Kicksat, to be launched by NASA later this year. So, why not test the boundaries and see how far crowdfunded space projects can go?</p>
<p>The 22 teams competing for the $30 million <a href=\"http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/prize-details\">Google Lunar XPRIZE</a> (set to expire at the end of 2015) may get to the Moon first. But thousands more privately funded Scouts could invade shortly thereafter (August 2016, by the project’s ETA).</p>
<p>In either case, it’s remarkable that some of the first manmade objects to land on the Moon’s surface since the 70s may be built and deployed by privately funded (or crowdfunded) collaborations of enthusiastic hackers and space nerds.</p>

<p>Over the years, it has become increasingly evident that <em>Star Trek</em> is a highly influential — if not the most influential — work in science fiction that has inspired generations of people to pursue science and technology careers. Every day we edge closer to many of the show’s imagined 23rd century technologies, but perhaps the one that arguably has been the most sought after is the tricorder, a device with sensors that can scan, analyze, and record data on pretty much anything. While an environmental tricorder that analyzes a geographic region would be advantageous for scouting new frontiers, it was the show’s medical tricorder able to detect injury and disease rapidly that held such a degree of technological wonder that it almost seemed magical or otherworldly.</p>
<p>But not any more — a first version of a medical tricorder is within reach, thanks to a startup named Scanadu.</p>
<p>The device, called a Scout, is a handheld, disc-shaped sensor that when placed against the forehead for 10 seconds, will monitor vital signs, including temperature, respiratory rate, blood oxygenation, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Additionally, it performs an electrocardiogram and assesses “stress” as a custom metric. The Scout transmits these data to an integrated smartphone app that can record, track, and analyze vital signs providing a single “comprehensive healthfeed” for multiple users.</p>
<p>And the Scout isn’t  just a crazy proposal – it’s a real device that was <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/20/inside-singularity-university-bloomberg-profiles-su-on-brink-tv-show/\">recently profiled on Bloomberg TV</a> and is coming to stores next year.</p>
<p>To help bring the device to market, <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/scanadu-scout-the-first-medical-tricorder\">Scanadu recently launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo</a> with a modest goal of $100,000 to help bring the device to market. Amazingly, that goal was smashed in just two hours. To date, the campaign has raised over $1.3 million with the help of nearly 7,000 funders.</p>
<p>Check out the pitch video for the Indiegogo campaign to learn more about the Scout:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/rKCeoiRhVuI?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Now Scanadu has been able to raise funds in the past, as it did in 2011 <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2011/12/24/scanadu-raises-2m-for-medical-tricorder-video/\">when it brought in $2 million from investors</a>. The team also has enjoyed support from NASA, as the Singularity University company is located at the AMES Research Park in Silicon Valley (in fact, the concept for the Scout was conceived after founder Walter De Brouwer attended a FutureMed conference, one of SU’s premiere executive programs).</p>
<p>Crowdfunding, however, provides a sense of consumer reception and demand for a product.</p>
<p>With a few weeks left still, the success of this campaign bodes well for the Scout’s and Scanadu’s future. In fact, the startup has even laid out plans for its next device: the ScanaFlo, a disposable paddle that will convert a smartphone into a urine analysis reader to measure levels of glucose, protein, leukocytes, nitrates, blood, bilirubin, urobilinogen, specific gravity, and pH. It will even perform pregnancy tests.</p>

<p>While some firms are using computer vision to <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/04/20/willow-garage-spinoff-ipi-is-building-robots-that-can-see-think-and-act/\">empower factory robots</a>, others are turning digital eyes on you and me to perfect the art of advertising, and an increasingly data-hungry ad industry is buying in.</p>
<p>One of the latest to jump onboard, AOL’s content subsidiary, Be On, recently <a href=\"http://www.aolnetworks.com/blog/be-integrates-realeyes-emotion-measurement-platform-branded-video-campaigns\">announced a partnership</a> with Realeyes, a provider of face and emotion detection software.</p>
<p>First things first, fear not, <a href=\"http://www.realeyesit.com/homepage.aspx\">Realeyes</a> isn’t secretly sitting behind your webcam as you read this article. The service is more of an online marketing focus group. Volunteers are paid to review advertisements and give feedback. Unlike a traditional focus group, however, Realeyes volunteers can participate from home with no more than a laptop and webcam.</p>
<p>Realeyes records volunteer reactions to ads and sends the data back to the firm for processing. The software recognizes general expressions like happiness, fear, anger, disgust, sadness, and surprise.</p>
<p>Clients can poll populations up to seven million (though most will opt for much smaller groups) and get their data back in less than two days at a fraction of the price of other alternatives. Once complete, the data forms an emotional timeline for the advertisement’s duration and can be sliced and diced however the client wishes.</p>
<p>How does the chosen demographic of white American females between 25 and 30 react to this video? 67.5% were disgusted but not until the last five seconds, and before that, the typical expression was neutral to happy. Let’s tweak that last line a bit, shall we? (Or…yes! Exactly as intended.)</p>
<p>Intelligent software plus the power of big data and efficient online data collection. Fast, powerful, and cheap. It’s easy to see how useful this technology might be for market research and advertising.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH138_2-BIG.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64244\" alt=\"SH138_#2 BIG\" src=\"http://3278as3udzze1hdk0f2th5nf18c1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH138_2-BIG.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"308\" /></a></p>
<p>But how accurate is it? Judging by the Realeyes video, the tech works best on exaggerated facial expressions. Yet our expressions are complex and numerous. And only a handful of advertisements elicit overt reactions.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that what Realeyes has done isn’t interesting. But it isn’t true emotion recognition just yet. Teaching a computer to interpret facial expressions reminds us of the challenge of writing a program to convert speech to text.</p>
<p>Many expressions are the equivalent of homophones in spoken language. They require context and subtle cues to distinguish one from the other. Was that an amused half smile or a dismissive smirk?</p>
<p>It may be that until the technology advances a bit, market research firms will pursue a mix of face and emotion detection trials and traditional focus groups. Or maybe wider use shows subtle expression doesn’t matter. If the sample size is big enough, maybe only rudimentary capability is necessary to yield usable results.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/16/cara-face-recognition-transforms-standard-webcams-into-intelligent-sensors/\">another piece</a> of face detection software, Cara, by <a href=\"https://imrsv.com/\">IMRSV</a> only collects general demographic data (age bracket and sex) and what kind of attention folks are giving the ad (glances, look backs, full attention, etc.). Whereas Realeyes is a futuristic focus group, Cara is trying to measure a real world space—an ad in a window or endcap in a store—and can be downloaded by virtually anyone.</p>
<p>In either case, advertising firms have at their fingertips a giant new source of data, and you can expect they’ll use it one way or another. That demand may drive face and emotion detection to become more advanced and pervasive in the next few years.</p>

Hill" "Mon, 15 Jul 2013 15:45:36 +0000" "<p>Boston Dynamics, the robotics design company, has been demonstrating to the world that we’re knee deep in the robot revolution. It was only back in April when the company released a <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/04/07/human-or-robot-harder-to-tell-in-latest-bipedal-robot-petman-video/\">series of videos of the humanoid robot PETMAN</a>, which captured a lot of media attention and a mix of reactions across the web.</p>
<p>Now only a few short months later, the latest design from Boston Dynamics dubbed the ATLAS robot has been unveiled <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2013/07/11.aspx\">as part of the DARPA Robotics Challenge Trials</a>, which is the next stage in a grand challenge sequence. ATLAS is a 6 foot 2 inch, 330-lb robot outfitted with hydraulic actuated joints, LIDAR sensing head, an onboard control computer, thermal management (like the PETMAN), and two sets of hands designed by iRobot and Sandia National Labs.</p>
<p>The released video is both awesome and unnerving in how life-like the company’s robots are becoming:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zkBnFPBV3f0?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>One thing is clear: ATLAS looks human because it’s designed to do what humans do…in certain situations, that is.</p>
<p>Before anyone freaks out about what science fiction movies have repeatedly forewarned us about, DARPA’s goal with <a href=\"http://www.theroboticschallenge.org/Default.aspx\">this program is aimed at</a> generating robots that can ”perform the most hazardous activities in future disaster response operations.” The seven teams selected to progress from the Virtual Robotics Challenge in June are tasked with programming ATLAS to carry out functions appropriate to the disaster scenario. The finals and a $2 million prize for DARPA’s challenge are schedule for the end of 2014.</p>
<p>Putting machines in places that are highly dangerous to humans is nothing new, but advances in AI and robotics has raised their sophistication to seemingly autonomous levels. This same phenomenon is occurring with the use of drones, as the military increasingly uses them as the go-to solution for operations that could cost soldiers their lives. Though concerns of privacy and security abound, the motive behind these development in robotics is to keep people from physical harm, regardless of the situation.</p>

<p>The solar-powered plane, <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/multimedia/educational-material/\">Solar Impulse</a>, recently touched down at New York’s JFK after flying the final leg of its journey across the US. The trip, a decade in the making, was itself but another step on the Solar Impulse team’s quest to fly around the world on solar power alone, and ultimately, to realize the dream of perpetual flight with no fuel.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/_q-UH1xAUdI?list=PL-tY-9eGABwxPrlhhkJem5jFN3ZdLq0sE\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Solar Impulse flew from San Francisco to Phoenix, Dallas, St. Louis, and Washington DC on its way to NYC. In each city, the team organized an event to show off their plane, proselytize, and chat with local and national politicians and celebrities. The aircraft performed admirably until the tour’s final leg, when an <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/37994-solar-plane-completes-cross-country-flight.html\">eight-foot tear</a> in the fabric under the wing forced the pilot to land a few hours earlier than planned.</p>
<p>Given the experimental nature of the technology, the team took heart the prime issue was a relatively simple fix.</p>
<p>Though Solar Impulse is neither the first plane to fly under solar power, nor the first such machine to cross the US—it may be the best demonstration of solar flight to date. The aircraft holds <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/pdf/edu/en/fiche_11_en.pdf \">three world records</a> for manned solar-powered flight, including the highest flight (30,300 ft), the longest flight (26 hours), and the farthest flight (693 miles). Crucially, the plane is capable of flying overnight, relying entirely on batteries charged by the sun.</p>

<p>The Solar Impulse project, first launched in 2003, commenced building in 2008, and the team completed their prototype mid-2009. Although the plane is blanketed in close to 11,000 solar cells and over a quarter of the aircraft’s mass goes to energy storage in its lithium batteries—the aircraft’s four engines knock out a mere 40 horsepower.</p>
<p>To make up for the weight of the batteries, engineers built the 21-meter fuselage <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/pdf/edu/en/fiche_4_en.pdf \">using carbon fiber</a> and further lightened the load with bolts and screws made of Solvay PrimoSpire, an ultra-light plastic as hard as metal.</p>
<p>Solar Impulse’s wings are <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/pdf/edu/en/fiche_3_en.pdf \">as long as</a> an Airbus A340, but the plane’s total weight is a mere 3,527 lbs—or a little more than a Porsche 911. Because the rest of the construction is so light, the aircraft is able to take off and fly under its own power, day or night. But even so, the plane’s average ground speed on the DC to NYC flight was a <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/\">sluggish 16 mph</a>. The trip took 18 hours, 23 minutes.</p>
<p>After wading through the project’s epic webpage—rife with references to Jules Verne, the Wright Brothers, Charles Lindbergh, and Chuck Yeager—you might at first be underwhelmed by the technology itself.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s solar powered, but it takes six times longer than Amtrak to go from Washington to New York. It’s hard to imagine a solar-powered aircraft replacing commercial airliners, the worst polluters in the air, anytime soon. The optimized Solar Impulse barely accommodates the weight of one passenger—never mind several hundred with luggage in tow.</p>
<p>Of course, the Wright brothers’ first prototype didn’t hint at commercial airlines or military jets. Perhaps better battery technology, more efficient solar panels, and radical new building materials and methods will subtract weight and add power and speed. (Maybe!)</p>
<p>But the likelier benefit? Folks will find other applications for solar flight. How about using a fleet of solar drones to replace expensive satellite infrastructure? Like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/loon/\">Google Loon</a>, minus the balloons. Or might an aircraft that can circle the globe without fuel be useful for reconnaissance? Sure! The technology has potential—even if the delivery is slightly overdone.</p>

<p>In a new ad for the <a href=\"http://www.europeantour.com/\">European Tour</a>, professional golfer, Rory McIlroy, goes head to head with a golf robot to see who can chip more balls into washing machines down range. First it was factory jobs, then chess, call centers, Jeopardy—and now, golf. Is there anything humans can do that robots can’t?</p>
<p>The bot shows off a flawlessly repeating swing, effortlessly knocks balls into the machines, and talks trash like a pro. Of course, McIlroy doesn’t do too shabby himself. This is an ad<em> </em>for human athletes after all.</p>
<p>The robot is made by <a href=\"http://www.golflabs.com/home.html\">Golf Laboratories</a> to test and compare golf clubs. An operator can dial in club speed and arm speed, torque and acceleration, even wrist position. With the swing’s variables tightly controlled and repeatable to within 0.00002″, operators can program a highly accurate trajectory, shape shots like the pros, or, to make things a little more realistic, hit balls off the club’s toe and heel like the rest of us hacks.</p>
<p>Excellent golfer? Check. As for the rest, sadly, this particular robot isn’t the Watson of stand up. All those one-liners were handcrafted by comedian Geoff Norcott. Even so, it’s notable a giant mainstream sporting organization like the European Tour went with the theme—robots are truly on the march.</p>

<p>NASA recently <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-s-polar-robotic-ranger-passes-first-greenland-test/\">concluded</a> a successful six-week test of a prototype polar rover near the highest point in Greenland, where the robotic vehicle traversed icy terrain in temperatures of minus 30 Celsius to help scientists learn more about how ice sheets are faring in the changing climate — without having to break for hot cocoa.</p>
<p>Greenland’s ice sheets are an important area of research because if they melt, the Earth will reflect less of the sun’s energy and warm more quickly.</p>
<p>The rover — dubbed GROVER, for Goddard Remote Operated Vehicle for Exploration and Research or simply Greenland Rover — was first developed by engineering students who participated in Goddard Flight Center’s boot camp in 2010 and 2011. NASA has subsequently funded fine-tuning of the vehicle at Boise State University under the guidance of geoscientist Hans-Peter Marshall.</p>
<p>The students approached Goddard glaciologist Lora Koenig about building a robot that would assist her in her research on Greenland’s ice sheets.</p>
<p>“How it came to me as the scientist involved is the engineers came to me and said, ‘Hey, we want to build a robot, do you have any science that a robot could do?’ And I said, ‘Well, yes, actually I do,’” Koenig said in a NASA video about the project:</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CFNQK8wSykA\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Glaciologists use radar to gather data about the thickness and topography of the superimposed layers of snow and ice in an ice sheet. Currently, radar devices are mounted on aircraft or on snowmobiles that scientists operate themselves.</p>
<p>A robotic rover that withstands arctic temperatures and moves across icy, uneven terrain would cost less than using aircraft and pollute pristine natural places less than gas-powered aircraft or snowmobiles do.</p>
<p>It would also spare scientists like Koenig hours of grueling exposure while also covering more ground in a day.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GROVER-NASA-ICE.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-64499\" alt=\"GROVER-NASA-ICE\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GROVER-NASA-ICE.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>“When we’re on snowmobiles, we can get 50 to 75 kilometers in a day. You get cold, and you need to stop for the day. GROVER will go slower than we would with snowmobiles, but when it goes for 24 hours, which a human can’t, it will actually gather more data for us,” Koenig explained.</p>
<p>GROVER, a six-foot tall, 800-pound vehicle that moves on a set of repurposed snowmobile tracks, uses solar panels to power a pair of rechargeable batteries that run its radar and telecommunications devices. Because the sun never dips below the horizon in the arctic summer, the engineers had hoped the rover would be able to operate all day and night.</p>
<p>But in Greenland’s frigid temperatures, GROVER’s batteries drained faster and took longer to recharge than expected. Electronics also took longer to reboot. In the end, the robotic vehicle operated for 12 hours a day, rather than the hoped-for 24.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GROVER-NASA-ICE-scientist.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-64502\" alt=\"GROVER-NASA-ICE-scientist\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GROVER-NASA-ICE-scientist.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>“This is very common the first time you take an instrument into an environment like Greenland. It’s always more challenging than you thought it was going to be,” <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-s-polar-robotic-ranger-passes-first-greenland-test/\">said</a> Boise State’s Marshall.</p>
<p>The researchers also had to continually tinker with the rover’s speed to prevent it from getting stuck in the snow and ice.</p>
<p>Still, GROVER’s data was good. It was able to collect measurements of the ice sheet that were detailed enough to isolate the melt layer that resulted from Greenland’s record high temperatures in 2012, one of the trial’s objectives.</p>
<p>GROVER joins the growing population of <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/09/11/liquid-robotics-aims-to-usher-in-era-of-smart-oceans-with-autonomous-robots/\">Earth-sensing robots</a> that are taking more measurements, more often, in more remote places. These <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/12/distributed-network-of-3000-ocean-robots-argo-notches-millionth-data-point/\">robots are casting</a> an ever widening net of observation, supplying scientific models with rich data sets, and deepening our understanding of Earth’s natural processes.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/18/learning-to-learn-faster-the-one-superpower-everyone-needs/\">In my last blog</a>, we got a chance to meet learning expert <a href=\"http://jimkwik.com/\">Jim Kwik</a> and explored some of the ideas behind <a href=\"http://superheroyou.com/\">SuperheroYou,</a> which is the Kwik-founded open-source community/university devoted to accelerated learning and brain optimization.</p>
<p>In May of this year, Kwik and SuperheroYou teamed up with <a href=\"http://about.zappos.com/meet-our-monkeys/tony-hsieh-ceo\">Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh</a> and the <a href=\"http://downtownproject.com/\">Downtown Vegas project</a> to host a super-learning super-summit in, of course, downtown Las Vegas. It was a best-of-the-best gathering. Kwik sought out an assembled a collection of extraordinary minds to share their high performance learning hacks.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenkotler/2013/06/02/learning-to-learn-faster-the-one-superpower-everyone-needs/\">In the last post,</a> we covered a small example of exactly this kind of brain optimizing hack: novelty. Our brains crave novelty. As a result, if you are trying to remember where you put your car keys, having an image of them 60 feet tall and dressed in drag helps. Mental exaggeration is a simple learning hack—a way of using the brain’s fundamental attraction to novelty as a way to optimize memory.</p>
<p>In this post, we’re going to examine a couple of similar tricks, one as a way to hack speed reading; the second as a way to accelerate problem solving, but before we can get into those details, first the “fish story.”</p>
<p>The fish story goes like this: A while back, Jim Kwik bumped into one of his old speed reading students (again, for more on Kwik and his reading talents, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/18/learning-to-learn-faster-the-one-superpower-everyone-needs/\">see my previous post</a>) who told him he had just reread one of his favorite books using Kwik’s techniques.</p>
<p>The book in question was Hemingway’s classic <em>The Old Man and the Sea. </em>What had surprised the student the second time through was the vividness of the experience.</p>
<p>“He said he could feel the hot sun beating down on his shoulders as he read,” explains Kwik. “That he could actually hear the sound of the waves crash. It was amazing, he loved the whole book,  except what he really couldn’t deal with was the smell of the fish.”</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old-man-and-the-sea.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64442\" alt=\"old man and the sea\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old-man-and-the-sea.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>
<p>Where this fish smell comes from and what it has to do with accelerated learning is where this fish story gets interesting—but before we can get there we have to first cover a few speed reading techniques.</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Kwik has discovered a few key reasons why most people read slowly, with back-skipping (re-reading passages over and again) and lack of focus among the most common.</p>
<p>The easiest way to solve these problems? Use a visual pacer. Your finger, a pencil, a computer mouse, whatever. This works so well because of another fundamental neuronal process: our eyes are attracted to motion.</p>
<p>We evolved in a world when a tiny rustle in the bush could have meant predator or could have been prey, but either way it paid to pay attention. So we do. We can’t help it.  Which is why simply the use of a visual pacer improves reading speeds by 25 percent.</p>
<p>But Kwik tells his students to either use their left finger for that pacer; or hold that pacer (i.e. a pencil) with their left hand—and that’s where this story gets interesting.</p>
<p>Here’s why: The left side of the body is controlled by the right side of the brain. While brain function is not evenly lateralized, the right side is far more creative than the left. When we control a pacer with our left hand, we are actively engaging these same creative process. It happens subconsciously, it happens automatically, but by engaging the right side of the brain we’re firing up the imagination which, in turn, fires us sense memory—which is why that student smelled fish.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing—the more we engage imagination to process information, the more vivid the real time experience of that information, and the much more likely we’re able to recall that data later.</p>
<p>Simply by using our left finger as a visual pacer we are using the brain’s own inner workings to our advantage. In a very real sense, we’re hacking the subconscious with the subconscious—and the result is extreme vivid and detailed recall.</p>
<p>Another presenter at the SuperheroYou Downtown Vegas summit was longtime television writer Lee Zlotoff, who has developed a problem-solving method that also involves hacking the subconscious with the subconscious.</p>
<p>He calls it the <a href=\"http://macgyvermethod.com/\">MacGyver Method.</a> MacGyver, you might remember, was an excellent problem solver. Zlotoff, meanwhile, who created MacGyver, had to become an excellent problem solver. It goes with the territory.</p>
<p>“To write episodic TV,” explains Zlotoff, “I had to produce an enormous amount of creative material, under very tight deadlines. There was no time to get stuck.”</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/gaDInuYw98k?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>After years of this work, Zlotoff noticed that whenever he did get stuck, the answers he sought never appeared up in obvious places—like when he was sitting at his desk plugging away at the problem. Rather, he always got his answers when driving or taking a shower. In fact, it happened so frequently that whenever Zlotoff got stuck he had started leaving his office so he could drive home and take a shower.</p>
<p>Eventually, Zlotoff decided to figure out why this was happening. What he discovered is the true power of the subconscious. “We have this idea,” he says, that because we use our conscious mind all day long, it’s actually more powerful than the subconscious. Nothing could be farther from the truth. <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=understanding-consciousness-measure-more-argue-less\">The subconscious is so much bigger and deeper and more capable than the conscious mind—even the comparisons get ridiculous</a>.”</p>
<p>Zlotoff points to two classic studies to make his case. The first, run by Stanford cell biologist Bruce Lipton, determined that the conscious mind processes roughly 40 bits of information a second.</p>
<p>The subconscious, though, can handle 20 million bits of information a second.</p>
<p>The second study, run at the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/colleges/university-of-pennsylvania/\">University of Pennsylvania</a>, was an attempt to verify the first. There researchers found Lipton’s figures were slightly conservative. By their calculations, the conscious mind could handle about 2,000 bits of data a second. And the subconscious? Some 400 billion.</p>
<p>More astounding, the Penn team clocked processing speeds. The conscious mind solves problems at roughly 100-150 miles-per-hour. Meanwhile, our subconscious blazes away at close to 100,000 m.p.h.</p>
<p>“Even if this research is off by a factor of 100,” says Zlotoff, “this still means the subconscious mind is 5000 to 2 million times faster than the conscious.”</p>
<p>This is also why taking a shower or driving a car is such an effective problem solving hack. When we engage in lightly stimulating activity—activity that requires mental processing, but not too much of it—we are occupying the conscious mind with a task, and allowing the subconscious mind to take over information processing responsibilities.</p>
<p>The period that the subconscious can process a problem without conscious interference is called the “the incubation period,” and knowing how to utilize it properly is core to Zlotoff’s MacGyver Method.</p>
<p>The method has three steps—let’s take a closer look:</p>
<blockquote><p>Step one: Write down your problem. Literally. Speaking it aloud won’t work. Telling a friend doesn’t help. Writing seems the key (why no one is yet certain). Be as detailed as possible, but don’t worry so much about connective tissue.</p>
<p>Step Two: Incubation. Step away from the problem for 1-4 hours (beginners might want to wait a half-day). During this period do something stimulating, but not taxing. Zlotoff, for example, builds models. Gardening, house cleaning, shooting basketballs all work fine. What doesn’t work is TV or video-game playing or reading—all require too much mental processing to do the trick.</p>
<p>Step Three: Sit back down at your notepad and start writing. It doesn’t matter what. Copy passages out of your favorite book, pen song lyrics, doesn’t matter. After a short delay—usually no more than a minute or two—the answers to your problems will start pouring out of you.</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds simple, but the results are stunning.</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve been using a similar method for a few years and have seen it improve my writing speeds by at least 15 percent.  Zlotoff, whose method is more precise than the one I was using, has seen bigger speed gains, to say nothing of downstream emotional benefits.</p>
<p>“I never have to worry about a problem. If I get stuck, I know my subconscious can come up with answers my conscious mind literally can’t dream of, and in far shorter time frames. It’s totally removed anxiety from my writing process.”</p>
<p>More formally, psychologists at the University of Michigan have been putting the MacGyver method through its paces, and while the data has yet to be formally released the early results are exceptionally promising.</p>
<p><strong>Stay Tuned:</strong> In my next post, we’ll meet Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh and performance poet Sekou Andrews and continue on with two more ways to hack the subconscious with the subconscious to accelerate learning.</p>

<p>Your connectome, the map of all 86 billion connected neurons in your brain, is hopelessly complex. In fact, one human connectome has a staggering 10,000 times that number of neural pathways. Every thought you have and every memory you hold exists in your connectome, and major efforts are under way to map it.</p>
<p>The good news is that you don’t need a fancy neuroscience degree to help out. In fact, the fancy degreed neuroscientists are hoping that you might pitch in.</p>
<p>Created by scientists at MIT, <a href=\"http://eyewire.org/\">Eyewire is a browser game</a> that lets players take on the challenge of mapping neural pathways in brains — no scientific background required. By playing, gamers are not only mapping neurons, but also training artificial intelligence algorithms to better understand how to map neurons themselves, what Amy Robinson, Creative Director at Eyewire, calls “augmented intelligence”. The more that gamers play, the better the computers get.</p>
<p>In an amplifying way, the team at MIT hopes that these human assisted computers will one day learn to map neurons by themselves.</p>
<p>To date, over 70,000 gamers from over 100 countries have signed up to play Eyewire, and it’s a good thing they did. Using today’s state of the art technology, it takes an AI-assisted researcher almost 50 hours to reconstruct a SINGLE neuron! At that pace, one researcher would need to devote the next 50 million years to neural mapping; no bathroom breaks allowed. Thankfully, there is one thing that technology does consistently overly time, which is improve.</p>

<p>Today our technology improves at the speed of Moore’s Law, and <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/10/leading-neuroscientist-says-kurzweil-singularity-prediction-a-bunch-of-hot-air/\">those who study that exponential growth, like Ray Kurzweil</a>, contend that we will not only map the brain in our lifetime, but are only a decade away from doing so. Such ambitious claims are certain to give a neuroscientist the same knee jerk reaction that life scientists had when similar early claims were made about sequencing human genomes.</p>
<p>Five years into the Human Genome Project, it was considered a failure since scientists had completed only 1% of the sequence. Somehow five years after that it was finished. That’s because early on, scientists were required to sequence the genome in linear order. Then, exponentially more powerful computers enabled what’s known as shotgun sequencing, a process that allowed scientists to sequence random strands while computers put those strands back in order; a much faster and simpler process. Better technologies have always improved ways of advancing research.</p>
<p>Mapping the connectome will be considerably more challenging than mapping the genome, but the lesson learned holds true. The key to mapping the connectome will be new technologies and innovative ways of using them.</p>
<p>The team at Eyewire understands this. With their platform, they are enabling a community of citizen scientists who contribute to breakthrough research; something previously restricted to degree holding academics. Additionally, they are leveraging the innate human desire to compete and play games. Considering that as a planet, we spend 3 billion hours playing videogames every week, imagine what can be accomplished when even a portion of that time is allocated to things like neural discovery?</p>
<p>The importance of mapping the brain cannot be overstated. Around the planet, we’re facing an increased prevalence of dementia, mood disorders, and other cognitive disease – an issue that hasn’t gone unnoticed by world leaders. Earlier this year the European Union awarded the <a href=\"http://www.humanbrainproject.eu\">Human Brain Project</a> $1.3 Billion over the next ten years while President Obama similarly pledged $100 million of his 2014 fiscal budget to, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/04/02/fact-sheet-brain-initiative\">Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies</a>, or BRAIN as the project is known.</p>
<p>The post brain mapped world will look nothing like the world of today. A functionally accurate brain map forever changes the equation for everything from medicine to human performance. Cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s and depression might one day be curable, while brain augmentation through cognitive implants could become commonplace.</p>
<p>At some unforeseen point in the future, researchers will peer into the brain at the resolution of individual synapses and understand what’s happening. In order to get there, scientists must uncover innovative ways of advancing brain science. The supercomputers of the future are a likely candidate to reconstruct all those neurons, but for now they’ll continue to study at the side of Eyewire’s community of scientist gamers.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, kids participated in the space race by launching homemade rockets a few hundred feet in the air. With the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1677943140/send-your-own-pocket-spacecraft-on-a-mission-to-th\">Pocket Spacecraft Kickstarter</a>, space fans may send their very own personal spacecraft to the Moon for as little as £199 (about $300) or £39 (about $60) to share their voyage with 20 other lunar-tics.</p>
<p>The spacecraft (or Scouts) are tiny polyimide discs—three inches across, weighing about a gram, and as thin as a piece of paper—but they’ll carry solar cells for power, a miniature computer, sensor suite, and radio antenna printed on or affixed to the surface.</p>
<p>In fact, each Scout boasts “computing power comparable to that of the Voyager spacecraft and Apollo flight computers.”</p>
<p>Participants will be able to track the progress of their spacecraft on a mission control smartphone app—including an augmented reality function whereby the user points their device at the sky to find their Scout.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/69326668?byline=0&portrait=0&color=ffffff\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Beyond going to the Moon, Pocket Spacecraft hopes their Scouts are able to survive reentry and land on a planet with an atmosphere like the Earth (or Mars, or Venus, or wherever!). Though the Scouts’ capability pales in comparison to the likes of one of NASA’s Mars rovers, they could potentially record basic data like magnetic field, temperature, or pressure and send these observations back home.</p>
<p>If funded, Kickstarters will design and test their custom spacecraft over 18 months. The finished Scouts will be loaded into a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat\">3U CubeSat</a> mothership and sent into Earth orbit on a commercial rocket.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64307\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-145_1-BIG.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64307\" alt=\"SH 145_#1 BIG\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-145_1-BIG.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"246\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">3U CubeSat.</p></div>
<p>From orbit, phase one of the mission will send a batch of Scouts back to Earth to prove them resistant to the rigors of reentry. (And to inspire a treasure hunt to find the fallen Scouts.) The mothership will then deploy a solar sail or fire up a solar-powered electrolysis propulsion system to slingshot it around the Earth to the Moon. From lunar orbit, the ship will send the remaining Scouts to the Moon’s surface.</p>
<p>We <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/23/tiny-cubesat-satellites-spur-revolution-in-space/\">recently wrote</a> about how CubeSats are democratizing space at a furious pace. Now, <a href=\"http://www.space.com/17273-tiny-lunarcubes-spacecraft-moon-exploration.html\">there’s a push</a> to move CubeSats beyond Earth orbit. If successful, the Pocket Spacecraft Kickstarter could be a pathfinder for interplanetary CubeSats and one of the first crowdfunded small satellites to go to another celestial body.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64308\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-145_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64308\" alt=\"Polyimide substrate with a penny for scale.\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-145_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Polyimide substrate with a penny for scale.</p></div>
<p>It’s an ambitious project, to be sure, but the project’s goals are plausible. CubeSat technology is maturing fast and continues to be tested in Earth orbit. And the team behind Pocket Spacecraft is experienced. Several team members worked on the early CubeSat Kickstarter, Kicksat, to be launched by NASA later this year. So, why not test the boundaries and see how far crowdfunded space projects can go?</p>
<p>The 22 teams competing for the $30 million <a href=\"http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/prize-details\">Google Lunar XPRIZE</a> (set to expire at the end of 2015) may get to the Moon first. But thousands more privately funded Scouts could invade shortly thereafter (August 2016, by the project’s ETA).</p>
<p>In either case, it’s remarkable that some of the first manmade objects to land on the Moon’s surface since the 70s may be built and deployed by privately funded (or crowdfunded) collaborations of enthusiastic hackers and space nerds.</p>

<p>Over the years, it has become increasingly evident that <em>Star Trek</em> is a highly influential — if not the most influential — work in science fiction that has inspired generations of people to pursue science and technology careers. Every day we edge closer to many of the show’s imagined 23rd century technologies, but perhaps the one that arguably has been the most sought after is the tricorder, a device with sensors that can scan, analyze, and record data on pretty much anything. While an environmental tricorder that analyzes a geographic region would be advantageous for scouting new frontiers, it was the show’s medical tricorder able to detect injury and disease rapidly that held such a degree of technological wonder that it almost seemed magical or otherworldly.</p>
<p>But not any more — a first version of a medical tricorder is within reach, thanks to a startup named Scanadu.</p>
<p>The device, called a Scout, is a handheld, disc-shaped sensor that when placed against the forehead for 10 seconds, will monitor vital signs, including temperature, respiratory rate, blood oxygenation, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Additionally, it performs an electrocardiogram and assesses “stress” as a custom metric. The Scout transmits these data to an integrated smartphone app that can record, track, and analyze vital signs providing a single “comprehensive healthfeed” for multiple users.</p>
<p>And the Scout isn’t  just a crazy proposal – it’s a real device that was <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/20/inside-singularity-university-bloomberg-profiles-su-on-brink-tv-show/\">recently profiled on Bloomberg TV</a> and is coming to stores next year.</p>
<p>To help bring the device to market, <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/scanadu-scout-the-first-medical-tricorder\">Scanadu recently launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo</a> with a modest goal of $100,000 to help bring the device to market. Amazingly, that goal was smashed in just two hours. To date, the campaign has raised over $1.3 million with the help of nearly 7,000 funders.</p>
<p>Check out the pitch video for the Indiegogo campaign to learn more about the Scout:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/rKCeoiRhVuI?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Now Scanadu has been able to raise funds in the past, as it did in 2011 <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2011/12/24/scanadu-raises-2m-for-medical-tricorder-video/\">when it brought in $2 million from investors</a>. The team also has enjoyed support from NASA, as the Singularity University company is located at the AMES Research Park in Silicon Valley (in fact, the concept for the Scout was conceived after founder Walter De Brouwer attended a FutureMed conference, one of SU’s premiere executive programs).</p>
<p>Crowdfunding, however, provides a sense of consumer reception and demand for a product.</p>
<p>With a few weeks left still, the success of this campaign bodes well for the Scout’s and Scanadu’s future. In fact, the startup has even laid out plans for its next device: the ScanaFlo, a disposable paddle that will convert a smartphone into a urine analysis reader to measure levels of glucose, protein, leukocytes, nitrates, blood, bilirubin, urobilinogen, specific gravity, and pH. It will even perform pregnancy tests.</p>

<p>The solar-powered plane, <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/multimedia/educational-material/\">Solar Impulse</a>, recently touched down at New York’s JFK after flying the final leg of its journey across the US. The trip, a decade in the making, was itself but another step on the Solar Impulse team’s quest to fly around the world on solar power alone, and ultimately, to realize the dream of perpetual flight with no fuel.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/_q-UH1xAUdI?list=PL-tY-9eGABwxPrlhhkJem5jFN3ZdLq0sE\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Solar Impulse flew from San Francisco to Phoenix, Dallas, St. Louis, and Washington DC on its way to NYC. In each city, the team organized an event to show off their plane, proselytize, and chat with local and national politicians and celebrities. The aircraft performed admirably until the tour’s final leg, when an <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/37994-solar-plane-completes-cross-country-flight.html\">eight-foot tear</a> in the fabric under the wing forced the pilot to land a few hours earlier than planned.</p>
<p>Given the experimental nature of the technology, the team took heart the prime issue was a relatively simple fix.</p>
<p>Though Solar Impulse is neither the first plane to fly under solar power, nor the first such machine to cross the US—it may be the best demonstration of solar flight to date. The aircraft holds <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/pdf/edu/en/fiche_11_en.pdf \">three world records</a> for manned solar-powered flight, including the highest flight (30,300 ft), the longest flight (26 hours), and the farthest flight (693 miles). Crucially, the plane is capable of flying overnight, relying entirely on batteries charged by the sun.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64426\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-146_3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64426\" alt=\"Solar Impulse co-founder, Bertand Piccard, celebrates his plane's maiden voyage.\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-146_3.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Solar Impulse co-founder, Bertand Piccard, celebrates the plane’s maiden voyage.</p></div>
<p>The Solar Impulse project, first launched in 2003, commenced building in 2008, and the team completed their prototype mid-2009. Although the plane is blanketed in close to 11,000 solar cells and over a quarter of the aircraft’s mass goes to energy storage in its lithium batteries—the aircraft’s four engines knock out a mere 40 horsepower.</p>
<p>To make up for the weight of the batteries, engineers built the 21-meter fuselage <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/pdf/edu/en/fiche_4_en.pdf \">using carbon fiber</a> and further lightened the load with bolts and screws made of Solvay PrimoSpire, an ultra-light plastic as hard as metal.</p>
<p>Solar Impulse’s wings are <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/pdf/edu/en/fiche_3_en.pdf \">as long as</a> an Airbus A340, but the plane’s total weight is a mere 3,527 lbs—or a little more than a Porsche 911. Because the rest of the construction is so light, the aircraft is able to take off and fly under its own power, day or night. But even so, the plane’s average ground speed on the DC to NYC flight was a <a href=\"http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/\">sluggish 16 mph</a>. The trip took 18 hours, 23 minutes.</p>
<p>After wading through the project’s epic webpage—rife with references to Jules Verne, the Wright Brothers, Charles Lindbergh, and Chuck Yeager—you might at first be underwhelmed by the technology itself.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s solar powered, but it takes six times longer than Amtrak to go from Washington to New York. It’s hard to imagine a solar-powered aircraft replacing commercial airliners, the worst polluters in the air, anytime soon. The optimized Solar Impulse barely accommodates the weight of one passenger—never mind several hundred with luggage in tow.</p>
<p>Of course, the Wright brothers’ first prototype didn’t hint at commercial airlines or military jets. Perhaps better battery technology, more efficient solar panels, and radical new building materials and methods will subtract weight and add power and speed. (Maybe!)</p>
<p>But the likelier benefit? Folks will find other applications for solar flight. How about using a fleet of solar drones to replace expensive satellite infrastructure? Like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/loon/\">Google Loon</a>, minus the balloons. Or might an aircraft that can circle the globe without fuel be useful for reconnaissance? Sure! The technology has potential—even if the delivery is slightly overdone.</p>

<p>In a new ad for the <a href=\"http://www.europeantour.com/\">European Tour</a>, professional golfer, Rory McIlroy, goes head to head with a golf robot to see who can chip more balls into washing machines down range. First it was factory jobs, then chess, call centers, Jeopardy—and now, golf. Is there anything humans can do that robots can’t?</p>
<p>The bot shows off a flawlessly repeating swing, effortlessly knocks balls into the machines, and talks trash like a pro. Of course, McIlroy doesn’t do too shabby himself. This is an ad<em> </em>for human athletes after all.</p>
<p>The robot is made by <a href=\"http://www.golflabs.com/home.html\">Golf Laboratories</a> to test and compare golf clubs. An operator can dial in club speed and arm speed, torque and acceleration, even wrist position. With the swing’s variables tightly controlled and repeatable to within 0.00002″, operators can program a highly accurate trajectory, shape shots like the pros, or, to make things a little more realistic, hit balls off the club’s toe and heel like the rest of us hacks.</p>
<p>Excellent golfer? Check. As for the rest, sadly, this particular robot isn’t the Watson of stand up. All those one-liners were handcrafted by comedian Geoff Norcott. Even so, it’s notable a giant mainstream sporting organization like the European Tour went with the theme—robots are truly on the march.</p>

<p>NASA recently <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-s-polar-robotic-ranger-passes-first-greenland-test/\">concluded</a> a successful six-week test of a prototype polar rover near the highest point in Greenland, where the robotic vehicle traversed icy terrain in temperatures of minus 30 Celsius to help scientists learn more about how ice sheets are faring in the changing climate — without having to break for hot cocoa.</p>
<p>Greenland’s ice sheets are an important area of research because if they melt, the Earth will reflect less of the sun’s energy and warm more quickly.</p>
<p>The rover — dubbed GROVER, for Goddard Remote Operated Vehicle for Exploration and Research or simply Greenland Rover — was first developed by engineering students who participated in Goddard Flight Center’s boot camp in 2010 and 2011. NASA has subsequently funded fine-tuning of the vehicle at Boise State University under the guidance of geoscientist Hans-Peter Marshall.</p>
<p>The students approached Goddard glaciologist Lora Koenig about building a robot that would assist her in her research on Greenland’s ice sheets.</p>
<p>“How it came to me as the scientist involved is the engineers came to me and said, ‘Hey, we want to build a robot, do you have any science that a robot could do?’ And I said, ‘Well, yes, actually I do,’” Koenig said in a NASA video about the project:</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CFNQK8wSykA\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Glaciologists use radar to gather data about the thickness and topography of the superimposed layers of snow and ice in an ice sheet. Currently, radar devices are mounted on aircraft or on snowmobiles that scientists operate themselves.</p>
<p>A robotic rover that withstands arctic temperatures and moves across icy, uneven terrain would cost less than using aircraft and pollute pristine natural places less than gas-powered aircraft or snowmobiles do.</p>
<p>It would also spare scientists like Koenig hours of grueling exposure while also covering more ground in a day.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GROVER-NASA-ICE.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-64499\" alt=\"GROVER-NASA-ICE\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GROVER-NASA-ICE.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>“When we’re on snowmobiles, we can get 50 to 75 kilometers in a day. You get cold, and you need to stop for the day. GROVER will go slower than we would with snowmobiles, but when it goes for 24 hours, which a human can’t, it will actually gather more data for us,” Koenig explained.</p>
<p>GROVER, a six-foot tall, 800-pound vehicle that moves on a set of repurposed snowmobile tracks, uses solar panels to power a pair of rechargeable batteries that run its radar and telecommunications devices. Because the sun never dips below the horizon in the arctic summer, the engineers had hoped the rover would be able to operate all day and night.</p>
<p>But in Greenland’s frigid temperatures, GROVER’s batteries drained faster and took longer to recharge than expected. Electronics also took longer to reboot. In the end, the robotic vehicle operated for 12 hours a day, rather than the hoped-for 24.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GROVER-NASA-ICE-scientist.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-64502\" alt=\"GROVER-NASA-ICE-scientist\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GROVER-NASA-ICE-scientist.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>“This is very common the first time you take an instrument into an environment like Greenland. It’s always more challenging than you thought it was going to be,” <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-s-polar-robotic-ranger-passes-first-greenland-test/\">said</a> Boise State’s Marshall.</p>
<p>The researchers also had to continually tinker with the rover’s speed to prevent it from getting stuck in the snow and ice.</p>
<p>Still, GROVER’s data was good. It was able to collect measurements of the ice sheet that were detailed enough to isolate the melt layer that resulted from Greenland’s record high temperatures in 2012, one of the trial’s objectives.</p>

<p>Your connectome, the map of all 86 billion connected neurons in your brain, is hopelessly complex. In fact, one human connectome has a staggering 10,000 times that number of neural pathways. Every thought you have and every memory you hold exists in your connectome, and major efforts are under way to map it.</p>
<p>The good news is that you don’t need a fancy neuroscience degree to help out. In fact, the fancy degreed neuroscientists are hoping that you might pitch in.</p>
<p>Created by scientists at MIT, <a href=\"http://eyewire.org/\">Eyewire is a browser game</a> that lets players take on the challenge of mapping neural pathways in brains — no scientific background required. By playing, gamers are not only mapping neurons, but also training artificial intelligence algorithms to better understand how to map neurons themselves, what Amy Robinson, Creative Director at Eyewire, calls “augmented intelligence”. The more that gamers play, the better the computers get.</p>
<p>In an amplifying way, the team at MIT hopes that these human assisted computers will one day learn to map neurons by themselves.</p>
<p>To date, over 70,000 gamers from over 100 countries have signed up to play Eyewire, and it’s a good thing they did. Using today’s state of the art technology, it takes an AI-assisted researcher almost 50 hours to reconstruct a SINGLE neuron! At that pace, one researcher would need to devote the next 50 million years to neural mapping; no bathroom breaks allowed. Thankfully, there is one thing that technology does consistently overly time, which is improve.</p>

<p>Today our technology improves at the speed of Moore’s Law, and <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/10/leading-neuroscientist-says-kurzweil-singularity-prediction-a-bunch-of-hot-air/\">those who study that exponential growth, like Ray Kurzweil</a>, contend that we will not only map the brain in our lifetime, but are only a decade away from doing so. Such ambitious claims are certain to give a neuroscientist the same knee jerk reaction that life scientists had when similar early claims were made about sequencing human genomes.</p>
<p>Five years into the Human Genome Project, it was considered a failure since scientists had completed only 1% of the sequence. Somehow five years after that it was finished. That’s because early on, scientists were required to sequence the genome in linear order. Then, exponentially more powerful computers enabled what’s known as shotgun sequencing, a process that allowed scientists to sequence random strands while computers put those strands back in order; a much faster and simpler process. Better technologies have always improved ways of advancing research.</p>
<p>Mapping the connectome will be considerably more challenging than mapping the genome, but the lesson learned holds true. The key to mapping the connectome will be new technologies and innovative ways of using them.</p>
<p>The team at Eyewire understands this. With their platform, they are enabling a community of citizen scientists who contribute to breakthrough research; something previously restricted to degree holding academics. Additionally, they are leveraging the innate human desire to compete and play games. Considering that as a planet, we spend 3 billion hours playing videogames every week, imagine what can be accomplished when even a portion of that time is allocated to things like neural discovery?</p>
<p>The importance of mapping the brain cannot be overstated. Around the planet, we’re facing an increased prevalence of dementia, mood disorders, and other cognitive disease – an issue that hasn’t gone unnoticed by world leaders. Earlier this year the European Union awarded the <a href=\"http://www.humanbrainproject.eu\">Human Brain Project</a> $1.3 Billion over the next ten years while President Obama similarly pledged $100 million of his 2014 fiscal budget to, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/04/02/fact-sheet-brain-initiative\">Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies</a>, or BRAIN as the project is known.</p>
<p>The post brain mapped world will look nothing like the world of today. A functionally accurate brain map forever changes the equation for everything from medicine to human performance. Cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s and depression might one day be curable, while brain augmentation through cognitive implants could become commonplace.</p>
<p>At some unforeseen point in the future, researchers will peer into the brain at the resolution of individual synapses and understand what’s happening. In order to get there, scientists must uncover innovative ways of advancing brain science. The supercomputers of the future are a likely candidate to reconstruct all those neurons, but for now they’ll continue to study at the side of Eyewire’s community of scientist gamers.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/18/learning-to-learn-faster-the-one-superpower-everyone-needs/\">In my last blog</a>, we got a chance to meet learning expert <a href=\"http://jimkwik.com/\">Jim Kwik</a> and explored some of the ideas behind <a href=\"http://superheroyou.com/\">SuperheroYou,</a> which is the Kwik-founded open-source community/university devoted to accelerated learning and brain optimization.</p>
<p>In May of this year, Kwik and SuperheroYou teamed up with <a href=\"http://about.zappos.com/meet-our-monkeys/tony-hsieh-ceo\">Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh</a> and the <a href=\"http://downtownproject.com/\">Downtown Vegas project</a> to host a super-learning super-summit in, of course, downtown Las Vegas. It was a best-of-the-best gathering. Kwik sought out an assembled a collection of extraordinary minds to share their high performance learning hacks.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenkotler/2013/06/02/learning-to-learn-faster-the-one-superpower-everyone-needs/\">In the last post,</a> we covered a small example of exactly this kind of brain optimizing hack: novelty. Our brains crave novelty. As a result, if you are trying to remember where you put your car keys, having an image of them 60 feet tall and dressed in drag helps. Mental exaggeration is a simple learning hack—a way of using the brain’s fundamental attraction to novelty as a way to optimize memory.</p>
<p>In this post, we’re going to examine a couple of similar tricks, one as a way to hack speed reading; the second as a way to accelerate problem solving, but before we can get into those details, first the “fish story.”</p>
<p>The fish story goes like this: A while back, Jim Kwik bumped into one of his old speed reading students (again, for more on Kwik and his reading talents, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/18/learning-to-learn-faster-the-one-superpower-everyone-needs/\">see my previous post</a>) who told him he had just reread one of his favorite books using Kwik’s techniques.</p>
<p>The book in question was Hemingway’s classic <em>The Old Man and the Sea. </em>What had surprised the student the second time through was the vividness of the experience.</p>
<p>“He said he could feel the hot sun beating down on his shoulders as he read,” explains Kwik. “That he could actually hear the sound of the waves crash. It was amazing, he loved the whole book,  except what he really couldn’t deal with was the smell of the fish.”</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old-man-and-the-sea.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64442\" alt=\"old man and the sea\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old-man-and-the-sea.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>
<p>Where this fish smell comes from and what it has to do with accelerated learning is where this fish story gets interesting—but before we can get there we have to first cover a few speed reading techniques.</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Kwik has discovered a few key reasons why most people read slowly, with back-skipping (re-reading passages over and again) and lack of focus among the most common.</p>
<p>The easiest way to solve these problems? Use a visual pacer. Your finger, a pencil, a computer mouse, whatever. This works so well because of another fundamental neuronal process: our eyes are attracted to motion.</p>
<p>We evolved in a world when a tiny rustle in the bush could have meant predator or could have been prey, but either way it paid to pay attention. So we do. We can’t help it.  Which is why simply the use of a visual pacer improves reading speeds by 25 percent.</p>
<p>But Kwik tells his students to either use their left finger for that pacer; or hold that pacer (i.e. a pencil) with their left hand—and that’s where this story gets interesting.</p>
<p>Here’s why: The left side of the body is controlled by the right side of the brain. While brain function is not evenly lateralized, the right side is far more creative than the left. When we control a pacer with our left hand, we are actively engaging these same creative process. It happens subconsciously, it happens automatically, but by engaging the right side of the brain we’re firing up the imagination which, in turn, fires us sense memory—which is why that student smelled fish.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing—the more we engage imagination to process information, the more vivid the real time experience of that information, and the much more likely we’re able to recall that data later.</p>
<p>Simply by using our left finger as a visual pacer we are using the brain’s own inner workings to our advantage. In a very real sense, we’re hacking the subconscious with the subconscious—and the result is extreme vivid and detailed recall.</p>
<p>Another presenter at the SuperheroYou Downtown Vegas summit was longtime television writer Lee Zlotoff, who has developed a problem-solving method that also involves hacking the subconscious with the subconscious.</p>
<p>He calls it the <a href=\"http://macgyvermethod.com/\">MacGyver Method.</a> MacGyver, you might remember, was an excellent problem solver. Zlotoff, meanwhile, who created MacGyver, had to become an excellent problem solver. It goes with the territory.</p>
<p>“To write episodic TV,” explains Zlotoff, “I had to produce an enormous amount of creative material, under very tight deadlines. There was no time to get stuck.”</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/gaDInuYw98k?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>After years of this work, Zlotoff noticed that whenever he did get stuck, the answers he sought never appeared up in obvious places—like when he was sitting at his desk plugging away at the problem. Rather, he always got his answers when driving or taking a shower. In fact, it happened so frequently that whenever Zlotoff got stuck he had started leaving his office so he could drive home and take a shower.</p>
<p>Eventually, Zlotoff decided to figure out why this was happening. What he discovered is the true power of the subconscious. “We have this idea,” he says, that because we use our conscious mind all day long, it’s actually more powerful than the subconscious. Nothing could be farther from the truth. <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=understanding-consciousness-measure-more-argue-less\">The subconscious is so much bigger and deeper and more capable than the conscious mind—even the comparisons get ridiculous</a>.”</p>
<p>Zlotoff points to two classic studies to make his case. The first, run by Stanford cell biologist Bruce Lipton, determined that the conscious mind processes roughly 40 bits of information a second.</p>
<p>The subconscious, though, can handle 20 million bits of information a second.</p>
<p>The second study, run at the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/colleges/university-of-pennsylvania/\">University of Pennsylvania</a>, was an attempt to verify the first. There researchers found Lipton’s figures were slightly conservative. By their calculations, the conscious mind could handle about 2,000 bits of data a second. And the subconscious? Some 400 billion.</p>
<p>More astounding, the Penn team clocked processing speeds. The conscious mind solves problems at roughly 100-150 miles-per-hour. Meanwhile, our subconscious blazes away at close to 100,000 m.p.h.</p>
<p>“Even if this research is off by a factor of 100,” says Zlotoff, “this still means the subconscious mind is 5000 to 2 million times faster than the conscious.”</p>
<p>This is also why taking a shower or driving a car is such an effective problem solving hack. When we engage in lightly stimulating activity—activity that requires mental processing, but not too much of it—we are occupying the conscious mind with a task, and allowing the subconscious mind to take over information processing responsibilities.</p>
<p>The period that the subconscious can process a problem without conscious interference is called the “the incubation period,” and knowing how to utilize it properly is core to Zlotoff’s MacGyver Method.</p>
<p>The method has three steps—let’s take a closer look:</p>
<blockquote><p>Step one: Write down your problem. Literally. Speaking it aloud won’t work. Telling a friend doesn’t help. Writing seems the key (why no one is yet certain). Be as detailed as possible, but don’t worry so much about connective tissue.</p>
<p>Step Two: Incubation. Step away from the problem for 1-4 hours (beginners might want to wait a half-day). During this period do something stimulating, but not taxing. Zlotoff, for example, builds models. Gardening, house cleaning, shooting basketballs all work fine. What doesn’t work is TV or video-game playing or reading—all require too much mental processing to do the trick.</p>
<p>Step Three: Sit back down at your notepad and start writing. It doesn’t matter what. Copy passages out of your favorite book, pen song lyrics, doesn’t matter. After a short delay—usually no more than a minute or two—the answers to your problems will start pouring out of you.</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds simple, but the results are stunning.</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve been using a similar method for a few years and have seen it improve my writing speeds by at least 15 percent.  Zlotoff, whose method is more precise than the one I was using, has seen bigger speed gains, to say nothing of downstream emotional benefits.</p>
<p>“I never have to worry about a problem. If I get stuck, I know my subconscious can come up with answers my conscious mind literally can’t dream of, and in far shorter time frames. It’s totally removed anxiety from my writing process.”</p>
<p>More formally, psychologists at the University of Michigan have been putting the MacGyver method through its paces, and while the data has yet to be formally released the early results are exceptionally promising.</p>
<p><strong>Stay Tuned:</strong> In my next post, we’ll meet Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh and performance poet Sekou Andrews and continue on with two more ways to hack the subconscious with the subconscious to accelerate learning.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, kids participated in the space race by launching homemade rockets a few hundred feet in the air. With the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1677943140/send-your-own-pocket-spacecraft-on-a-mission-to-th\">Pocket Spacecraft Kickstarter</a>, space fans may send their very own personal spacecraft to the Moon for as little as £199 (about $300) or £39 (about $60) to share their voyage with 20 other lunar-tics.</p>
<p>The spacecraft (or Scouts) are tiny polyimide discs—three inches across, weighing about a gram, and as thin as a piece of paper—but they’ll carry solar cells for power, a miniature computer, sensor suite, and radio antenna printed on or affixed to the surface.</p>
<p>In fact, each Scout boasts “computing power comparable to that of the Voyager spacecraft and Apollo flight computers.”</p>
<p>Participants will be able to track the progress of their spacecraft on a mission control smartphone app—including an augmented reality function whereby the user points their device at the sky to find their Scout.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/69326668?byline=0&portrait=0&color=ffffff\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Beyond going to the Moon, Pocket Spacecraft hopes their Scouts are able to survive reentry and land on a planet with an atmosphere like the Earth (or Mars, or Venus, or wherever!). Though the Scouts’ capability pales in comparison to the likes of one of NASA’s Mars rovers, they could potentially record basic data like magnetic field, temperature, or pressure and send these observations back home.</p>
<p>If funded, Kickstarters will design and test their custom spacecraft over 18 months. The finished Scouts will be loaded into a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat\">3U CubeSat</a> mothership and sent into Earth orbit on a commercial rocket.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64307\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-145_1-BIG.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64307\" alt=\"SH 145_#1 BIG\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-145_1-BIG.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"246\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">3U CubeSat.</p></div>
<p>From orbit, phase one of the mission will send a batch of Scouts back to Earth to prove them resistant to the rigors of reentry. (And to inspire a treasure hunt to find the fallen Scouts.) The mothership will then deploy a solar sail or fire up a solar-powered electrolysis propulsion system to slingshot it around the Earth to the Moon. From lunar orbit, the ship will send the remaining Scouts to the Moon’s surface.</p>
<p>We <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/23/tiny-cubesat-satellites-spur-revolution-in-space/\">recently wrote</a> about how CubeSats are democratizing space at a furious pace. Now, <a href=\"http://www.space.com/17273-tiny-lunarcubes-spacecraft-moon-exploration.html\">there’s a push</a> to move CubeSats beyond Earth orbit. If successful, the Pocket Spacecraft Kickstarter could be a pathfinder for interplanetary CubeSats and one of the first crowdfunded small satellites to go to another celestial body.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_64308\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-145_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64308\" alt=\"Polyimide substrate with a penny for scale.\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-145_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Polyimide substrate with a penny for scale.</p></div>
<p>It’s an ambitious project, to be sure, but the project’s goals are plausible. CubeSat technology is maturing fast and continues to be tested in Earth orbit. And the team behind Pocket Spacecraft is experienced. Several team members worked on the early CubeSat Kickstarter, Kicksat, to be launched by NASA later this year. So, why not test the boundaries and see how far crowdfunded space projects can go?</p>
<p>The 22 teams competing for the $30 million <a href=\"http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/prize-details\">Google Lunar XPRIZE</a> (set to expire at the end of 2015) may get to the Moon first. But thousands more privately funded Scouts could invade shortly thereafter (August 2016, by the project’s ETA).</p>
<p>In either case, it’s remarkable that some of the first manmade objects to land on the Moon’s surface since the 70s may be built and deployed by privately funded (or crowdfunded) collaborations of enthusiastic hackers and space nerds.</p>

<p>Over the years, it has become increasingly evident that <em>Star Trek</em> is a highly influential — if not the most influential — work in science fiction that has inspired generations of people to pursue science and technology careers. Every day we edge closer to many of the show’s imagined 23rd century technologies, but perhaps the one that arguably has been the most sought after is the tricorder, a device with sensors that can scan, analyze, and record data on pretty much anything. While an environmental tricorder that analyzes a geographic region would be advantageous for scouting new frontiers, it was the show’s medical tricorder able to detect injury and disease rapidly that held such a degree of technological wonder that it almost seemed magical or otherworldly.</p>
<p>But not any more — a first version of a medical tricorder is within reach, thanks to a startup named Scanadu.</p>
<p>The device, called a Scout, is a handheld, disc-shaped sensor that when placed against the forehead for 10 seconds, will monitor vital signs, including temperature, respiratory rate, blood oxygenation, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Additionally, it performs an electrocardiogram and assesses “stress” as a custom metric. The Scout transmits these data to an integrated smartphone app that can record, track, and analyze vital signs providing a single “comprehensive healthfeed” for multiple users.</p>
<p>And the Scout isn’t  just a crazy proposal – it’s a real device that was <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/20/inside-singularity-university-bloomberg-profiles-su-on-brink-tv-show/\">recently profiled on Bloomberg TV</a> and is coming to stores next year.</p>
<p>To help bring the device to market, <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/scanadu-scout-the-first-medical-tricorder\">Scanadu recently launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo</a> with a modest goal of $100,000 to help bring the device to market. Amazingly, that goal was smashed in just two hours. To date, the campaign has raised over $1.3 million with the help of nearly 7,000 funders.</p>
<p>Check out the pitch video for the Indiegogo campaign to learn more about the Scout:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/rKCeoiRhVuI?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Now Scanadu has been able to raise funds in the past, as it did in 2011 <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2011/12/24/scanadu-raises-2m-for-medical-tricorder-video/\">when it brought in $2 million from investors</a>. The team also has enjoyed support from NASA, as the Singularity University company is located at the AMES Research Park in Silicon Valley (in fact, the concept for the Scout was conceived after founder Walter De Brouwer attended a FutureMed conference, one of SU’s premiere executive programs).</p>
<p>Crowdfunding, however, provides a sense of consumer reception and demand for a product.</p>
<p>With a few weeks left still, the success of this campaign bodes well for the Scout’s and Scanadu’s future. In fact, the startup has even laid out plans for its next device: the ScanaFlo, a disposable paddle that will convert a smartphone into a urine analysis reader to measure levels of glucose, protein, leukocytes, nitrates, blood, bilirubin, urobilinogen, specific gravity, and pH. It will even perform pregnancy tests.</p>

<p>One of the latest to jump onboard, AOL’s content subsidiary, Be On, recently <a href=\"http://www.aolnetworks.com/blog/be-integrates-realeyes-emotion-measurement-platform-branded-video-campaigns\">announced a partnership</a> with Realeyes, a provider of face and emotion detection software.</p>
<p>First things first, fear not, <a href=\"http://www.realeyesit.com/homepage.aspx\">Realeyes</a> isn’t secretly sitting behind your webcam as you read this article. The service is more of an online marketing focus group. Volunteers are paid to review advertisements and give feedback. Unlike a traditional focus group, however, Realeyes volunteers can participate from home with no more than a laptop and webcam.</p>
<p>Realeyes records volunteer reactions to ads and sends the data back to the firm for processing. The software recognizes general expressions like happiness, fear, anger, disgust, sadness, and surprise.</p>
<p>Clients can poll populations up to seven million (though most will opt for much smaller groups) and get their data back in less than two days at a fraction of the price of other alternatives. Once complete, the data forms an emotional timeline for the advertisement’s duration and can be sliced and diced however the client wishes.</p>
<p>How does the chosen demographic of white American females between 25 and 30 react to this video? 67.5% were disgusted but not until the last five seconds, and before that, the typical expression was neutral to happy. Let’s tweak that last line a bit, shall we? (Or…yes! Exactly as intended.)</p>
<p>Intelligent software plus the power of big data and efficient online data collection. Fast, powerful, and cheap. It’s easy to see how useful this technology might be for market research and advertising.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH138_2-BIG.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64244\" alt=\"SH138_#2 BIG\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH138_2-BIG.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"308\" /></a></p>
<p>But how accurate is it? Judging by the Realeyes video, the tech works best on exaggerated facial expressions. Yet our expressions are complex and numerous. And only a handful of advertisements elicit overt reactions.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that what Realeyes has done isn’t interesting. But it isn’t true emotion recognition just yet. Teaching a computer to interpret facial expressions reminds us of the challenge of writing a program to convert speech to text.</p>
<p>Many expressions are the equivalent of homophones in spoken language. They require context and subtle cues to distinguish one from the other. Was that an amused half smile or a dismissive smirk?</p>
<p>It may be that until the technology advances a bit, market research firms will pursue a mix of face and emotion detection trials and traditional focus groups. Or maybe wider use shows subtle expression doesn’t matter. If the sample size is big enough, maybe only rudimentary capability is necessary to yield usable results.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/16/cara-face-recognition-transforms-standard-webcams-into-intelligent-sensors/\">another piece</a> of face detection software, Cara, by <a href=\"https://imrsv.com/\">IMRSV</a> only collects general demographic data (age bracket and sex) and what kind of attention folks are giving the ad (glances, look backs, full attention, etc.). Whereas Realeyes is a futuristic focus group, Cara is trying to measure a real world space—an ad in a window or endcap in a store—and can be downloaded by virtually anyone.</p>
<p>In either case, advertising firms have at their fingertips a giant new source of data, and you can expect they’ll use it one way or another. That demand may drive face and emotion detection to become more advanced and pervasive in the next few years.</p>

Another goal? Make robots fast…like so freaky fast that NASCAR fans are left with mouths gaping.</p>
<p>Fortunately, researchers seem happy to provide robot enthusiasts with blazingly fast bots. In a recent video with the unfortunately underwhelming title of “Efficiency and Effectiveness Analysis of a New Direct Drive Miniature Quadruped Robot,” <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0LQd4Mk42o\">researchers from the University of Maryland and John Hopkins have constructed a miniature robot</a> with independent drive motors propelling its four whegs, which are hybrid-wheel-legs that offer the best of both.</p>
<p>The bot can travel up to 30 body lengths a second (2.2 m/s or around 5 MPH). <a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/miniature-quadruped-robot-is-blazingly-fast\">As IEEE Spectrum points out</a>, a human traveling the equivalent relative distance in the same time would be going approximately 120 MPH.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-0LQd4Mk42o?rel=0\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>The research was recently presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Germany.</p>
<p>As the video shows, the bots just aren’t fast, but able to climb up objects and have a zero turning radius. Future modifications to the design are predicted to make the little bots travel even faster. There are also plans to replace the multispoked whegs with single spokes, thereby more closely resembling a true quadruped.</p>
<p>Though cuteness doesn’t appear to have been one of the project goals for the team, it’s hard not to want to make up cutesy names for this little guy motoring around.</p>
<p>Co-author Christopher Brown stated in the IEEE Spectrum comments to “Keep following our research and you’re bound to see a real quadruped doing many different gaits (walk/trot/canter/gallop/jump) in the future!”</p>
<p>With other robotics groups actively pushing the speed envelope for their own creations, it’s clear that the race for highly mobile, speedy bots is just getting started.</p>

<p>The bot can travel up to 30 body lengths a second (2.2 m/s or around 5 MPH). <a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/miniature-quadruped-robot-is-blazingly-fast\">As IEEE Spectrum points out</a>, a human traveling the equivalent relative distance in the same time would be going approximately 120 MPH.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-0LQd4Mk42o?rel=0\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>The research was recently presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Germany.</p>
<p>As the video shows, the bots just aren’t fast, but able to climb up objects and have a zero turning radius. Future modifications to the design are predicted to make the little bots travel even faster. There are also plans to replace the multispoked whegs with single spokes, thereby more closely resembling a true quadruped.</p>
<p>Though cuteness doesn’t appear to have been one of the project goals for the team, it’s hard not to want to make up cutesy names for this little guy motoring around.</p>
<p>Co-author Christopher Brown stated in the IEEE Spectrum comments to “Keep following our research and you’re bound to see a real quadruped doing many different gaits (walk/trot/canter/gallop/jump) in the future!”</p>
<p>With other robotics groups actively pushing the speed envelope for their own creations, it’s clear that the race for highly mobile, speedy bots is just getting started.</p>

<p>A year and a half ago virtual reality was an elusive technodream. Maybe it still is. But since the middle of 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/\">Oculus Rift</a>, VR’s  latest <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/31/oculus-rift-is-breathing-new-life-into-the-dream-of-virtual-reality/\">great hope</a>, is winning over developers and newbies alike, accruing accolades, awards—and now cold cash.</p>
<p>After a successful Kickstarter and this year’s delivery of Rift headsets to developers, Oculus recently <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/vr-gets-vc/\">secured $16 million</a> in Series A funding to keep the wheels turning. Four venture capital firms (Spark Capital, Matrix Partners, Founders Fund, and Formation 8) contributed funds to take Oculus mainstream.</p>
<p>Gaming’s biggest names just released their “next generation” systems, and there are all kinds of neat additions. But they’re still building on the old model. Oculus, meanwhile, offers a fundamentally different experience.</p>
<p>When the Rift, an immersive virtual reality headset, first hit the tech community, it was but a bootstrapped pair of ski goggles with a screen hacked together in a garage. Rudimentary or no, the system impressed game developer royalty, avid gamers, and journalists alike.</p>
<p>The firm directed all that excitement into a $2.4 million Kickstarter and funded a manufacturing run for developers. Less obvious, but no less important, the Kickstarter is bringing a round of testing and feedback from professional game developers, a growing roster of VR-tailored games, and perhaps most valuable, credibility in the developer community.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-143_2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64141\" alt=\"SH 143_#2\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-143_2.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"318\" /></a></p>
<p>In roughly eighteen months, Oculus has blossomed from a guy in a garage to a <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/company/people/\">24-person team</a> of top gaming talent that’s manufactured and shipped their first devices. But it doesn’t end there. The final audience isn’t only the tech savviest. Quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Oculus is questing for a glitch-free, user friendly, immersive virtual reality experience for all of us. But to do that, they need investors. Which is why it’s a good thing they’ve got a story that virtually sells itself, a proven piece of hardware, a growing store of crowdsourced software, and a manufacturing run in their pocket.</p>
<p>Oculus raised $16 million in their initial round, and one imagines, if needed, there’s more where that came from. On the <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/vr-gets-vc/\">company blog</a>, Oculus founder, Palmer Luckey, wrote that the cash infusion should open doors for the firm.</p>
<p>“[This funding] helps us hire the best and brightest minds in VR from around the world. It lets us experiment and prototype with more cutting-edge tech. And it allows us to build a badass, consumer VR gaming platform, the likes of which the world has never seen.”</p>
<p>If all goes to plan (and as always, that’s a big if), it’s the kind of story you might expect in a Peter Diamandis keynote in the not too distant future. The Rift is an excellent example of how much the little guy can do (and how fast) in our exponential economy.</p>
<p>So, how long will it be before you or I can purchase a Rift of our very own? Oculus still isn’t saying. But they continue tinkering and testing behind the scenes.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSboqL82fmw\">The company brought</a> a 1080p “HD VR” Rift headset with them to E3. Though the pixels aren’t entirely undetectable, the higher def screen made them less obvious. Remember, 1080p is great from eight feet away, but the Rift display is only inches from your eyes.</p>
<p>The team is also reportedly still working on positional tracking (not just head tracking) for the consumer version. Nate Mitchell, VP of product, told <em>Tested</em>, “We’re not talking a wide, huge Kinect-type thing. But something that let’s you lean down and examine things in the game world.”</p>
<p>In the end, the not-so-quantifiable due date may be whenever Oculus gets the experience just right. There’s less room for error when you’re aiming a brand new piece of hardware at folks on their sofas. Not none, but less.</p>
<p>To really catch fire, a new product like the Rift ought to deliver an experience akin to tasting a deliciously unexpected combination of flavors at a fine restaurant. The moment forces you to close your eyes and savor. With the Rift, however, you might want to keep your eyes open and opt for a big grin instead.</p>

<p>Monsanto, the world’s largest seed company, recently reported the finding of unapproved genetically modified wheat in an Oregon field—and nobody knows where it came from. This is of concern, especially to farmers, but raises a larger question too. If genetic modification is the future, how will we control our creations?</p>
<p>The wheat at the center of this mystery was genetically modified to resist Monsanto’s herbicide, Roundup. The Oregon farmer discovered the plants growing in a fallow field and <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2013/05/finding_genetically_modified_w.html\">tried to kill</a> them with the widely-used herbicide. When they survived, he sent samples to Oregon State University where tests revealed it had been genetically modified to contain a Roundup resistant CP4/maize EPSPS gene. The USDA later confirmed these <a href=\"http://www.aphis.usda.gov/newsroom/2013/05/ge_wheat_detection.shtml\">findings</a>.</p>
<p>Although Monsanto got FDA approval for the wheat in food, they withdrew their EPA application in 2004, due to farmers worried about the potential loss of markets in Europe and Asia. The firm ended field trials and never marketed the product.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64027 alignright\" alt=\"Monsanto_#4\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_4.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Since the wheat was found and tested, Monsanto has been on the offensive to control what’s fast became a public relations mess.</p>
<p>Chief technology officer, Robb Fraley, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-05/monsanto-says-rogue-wheat-didn-t-contaminate-oregon-seed.html\">noted to the press</a> that the unapproved plants were found growing on less than one percent of the farmer’s 125-acre field, and Monsanto’s subsequent tests showed no sign of cross-contamination.</p>
<p>“It seems likely to be a random, isolated occurrence more consistent with the accidental or purposeful mixing of a small amount of seed during the planting, harvesting or during the fallow cycle in an individual field.”</p>
<p>The firm <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-05/monsanto-says-rogue-wheat-didn-t-contaminate-oregon-seed.html\">stopped planting</a> Roundup Ready wheat in Oregon over 12 years ago, the seeds are only viable for two years in the soil, and this is the first incident since trials ended in 2005. Monsanto isn’t implicating the farmer, but they aren’t ruling out a deliberate act of sabotage by someone else.</p>
<p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130621/us-genetically-modified-wheat/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics\">have postponed</a> imports of US white wheat from the region while they continue to study information from US officials. Meanwhile, citing economic damages, Monsanto <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-07/monsanto-sued-on-behalf-of-farmers-over-modified-wheat.html\">has been sued</a> by an environmental group and Washington farm and another group in Kansas.</p>
<p>Heading up the Washington lawsuit, the Center for Food Safety <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-07/monsanto-sued-on-behalf-of-farmers-over-modified-wheat.html\">stated</a>, “Because scheduled shipments already have been postponed and canceled, the presence of genetically engineered wheat has detrimentally impacted the domestic and global wheat markets and damaged plaintiffs and other wheat farmers.”</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64032 alignleft\" alt=\"Monsanto_#3\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_3.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Whether Monsanto is to blame or they’re the victim—how we control genetically modified plants or other organisms is a futuristic debate beginning in the here and now.</p>
<p>There are benefits to genetically modified crops. These include resistance to herbicides, diseases, and pests, better yield, increased shelf-life, and the potential for biofuel production. But opponents question whether genetically modified crops are safe, environmentally friendly, and whether genetically modified crops are really needed to address the world’s food needs.</p>
<p>Although, in this case, it appears the wheat did not spread, it can be difficult to predict the impact genetically modified organisms will have once released into the world at large.</p>
<p>It’s generally in Monsanto’s interest to avoid such errors. But clearly they are not immune. And perhaps a worse outcome is when the Monsantos of the world lose control of their product, inadvertently or via sabotage, as appears happened in this case.</p>
<p>With rapid advancement of knowledge and expertise in biotechnology, there’s great potential to do good. However, incidents like this underline the fact that no good thing is risk-free. As genetic modification continues, expect more such controversies—and hopefully, in their wake, better safeguards.</p>

<p>The name of China’s newest supercomputer, Tianhe-2, translates to MilkyWay-2. It’s a fitting moniker, maybe even a modest one. There are an estimated 300 billion stars in our galaxy. Tianhe-2 can run 100,000 times as many calculations <i>per second</i> as there are stars in the sky. Tianhe-2 is now <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">the fastest computer</a> on Earth, doubling the speed of its American rival, Titan—and it arrived two years ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>How did Tianhe-2 knock out Titan? Put simply, it’s a brute. Tianhe-2 uses six times as many cores (3.1 million) and twice the power (17.8 MW) as Titan to achieve double the speed (33.86 petaflop/s).</p>
<p>No single machine has held the top spot for more than one cycle since Japan’s K computer in 2011, and China hasn’t had the leading computer since Tianhe-2′s predecessor, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/11/07/china-owns-the-fastest-supercomputer-now-what-video/\">Tianhe-1a</a>. When completed, Tianhe-2’s theoretical peak performance will be 54.9 petaflop/s. That mark may stand for a little while. The US, at least, has no plans to build another supercomputer <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/159465-chinas-tianhe-2-supercomputer-twice-as-fast-as-does-titan-shocks-the-world-by-arriving-two-years-early\">until 2015</a>.</p>

<p>China is now a recognized supercomputing power. The country boasts <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">66 machines</a> on the Top500, over twice Japan’s 30 and a total second only to the US. Top500 editor, Jack Dongarra, who toured the Tianhe-2 facility and <a href=\"http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/tianhe-2-dongarra-report.pdf\">wrote a paper</a> on the supercomputer earlier this year, says it’s notable that, apart from its processors and coprocessors, Tianhe-2 is entirely of Chinese make.</p>
<p>“Most of the features of the system were developed in China, and they are only using Intel for the main compute part. That is, the interconnect, operating system, front-end processors and software are mainly Chinese.”</p>
<p>Even as China’s star is on the rise, the US remains undisputed hegemon. The US is home to <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">252 supercomputers</a>, or 50% of the Top500 list, and American companies IBM, Cray, Nvidia, and Intel still provide the hardware and know-how behind most of the world’s fastest machines.</p>
<p>Tianhe-2 and Titan are at the bleeding edge of supercomputing, but <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">total power</a> is growing fast too. Whereas there was only one supercomputer processing petaflop/s in 2008, there now are 26 such systems, up from 23 last November. And the list’s combined computing power is 223 petaflop/s, up from 123 petaflop/s a year ago.</p>
<p>If supercomputers continue along their current trajectory, sometime around 2018—maybe a little later—the world’s fastest computer will breach the exaflop/s barrier. That’s five times faster than the entire June 2013 list <i>combined.</i></p>

<p>What will we do with all that speed?</p>
<p>The <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/26/quest-to-model-the-human-brain-nets-a-billion-euros/\">Human Brain Project</a>, recently funded to the tune of a billion euros, plans to use exascale computing to build a complete digital model of the brain. The <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/12/03/australian-outback-launches-fastest-radio-telescope-in-the-world/\">Square Kilometer Array</a> radio telescope will use an exascale computer to link a 3,000 kilometer array, 50 times as sensitive and 10,000 times faster than any telescope in existence today.</p>
<p>All that says nothing of ordinary desktop, laptop, or (more likely) mobile computing. If today’s personal devices are speedier than a supercomputer from a couple decades ago, perhaps we’ll carry petaflop/s power in our pocket, glasses, or contact lenses twenty years from now.</p>
<p>Jason Silva says modern telescopes “extend the optic nerve of humanity.” But our brains are the more powerful organ, sitting behind the optic nerve and interpreting its input. Modern supercomputers are the brain’s James Webb. They extend, expand, accelerate, and augment our mental powers—the universe’s greatest trick yet.</p>

<p>Andrew Johnson, or Cyber-AJ, is one of  <a href=\"http://www.pdf.org/en/parkinson_statistics\">10 million people</a> suffering from Parkinson’s Disease (PD) worldwide. The disease is progressive, and it is devastating.</p>
<p>Diagnosed four years ago, Johnson recently described himself as a “39 year old trapped in an 89-year-old body.” But earlier this year, his life was transformed by a technique increasingly prescribed to a subset of PD patients called deep brain stimulation (DBS).</p>
<p>In February, Johnson underwent the second of two surgeries to implant a neurostimulator in his brain. The neurostimulator is about the <a href=\"http://www.parkinson.org/Parkinson-s-Disease/Treatment/Surgical-Treatment-Options/Deep-Brain-Stimulation\">size of a stopwatch</a>, is internally wired to a pacemaker in his chest, and once switched on by a handheld remote, the device’s electrical current jams the misbehaving neurons responsible for PD’s physical symptoms.</p>
<p>Since the surgery, Johnson’s life has been better. A lot better. In a recent video posted on his blog, <a href=\"http://youngandshaky.com/\">youngandshaky.com</a>, Johnson demonstrates the power of his new device by running an experiment on camera—he turns off the juice.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/uBh2LxTW0s0\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>It’s really a remarkable video. Johnson struggles to speak and is on the verge of dropping the remote when he switches the current back on. Almost instantaneously, his tremors subside. It’s difficult not to share that deepest of deep breaths he draws into his lungs. Discomfort eased, his relief is palpable.</p>
<p>But the surgery was no walk in the park. Afterward, Johnson says he was in “obscene amounts of pain” where the “slightest whisper was like a dagger to the skull.”</p>
<p>After a few days, his medical team began adjusting the device and dialing in the optimal level of current. A strange sensation, he says, but pleasurable, as his body came “alive again after being cased in concrete for so long.”</p>
<p>For patients like Johnson, DBS can deliver dramatic results, but it <a href=\"http://www.parkinson.org/NationalParkinsonFoundation/files/0d/0dc56c7a-01b9-4533-80f5-9963901a2bb4.pdf\">isn’t appropriate</a> for everyone, nor is the surgery <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/23/deep-brain-stimulation-used-to-treat-early-stage-parkinsons-disease/\">risk-free</a>.</p>
<p>As Johnson warns on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/06/25/195521917/the-man-with-a-battery-operated-brain?ft=1&f=1007\">his blog</a>, “This is not a miracle cure, it is a proven treatment which happened to work for me quite spectacularly, but that was because a subset of my symptoms were ones most likely to respond to the surgery.”</p>
<p>Those wondering whether DBS might work for them should consult their doctor. But when diagnosed and targeted accurately, in combination with medication, DBS can radically reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients and their families.</p>
<p>Even with an as yet incomplete understanding of what goes on between our ears, modern neuroscience is delivering life-changing improvements for some patients.</p>
<p>As research continues, such treatments may become more commonly prescribed and increasingly effective. Cyber-AJ and his “battery operated brain” exemplify the inspiring combination of man, machine, and modern science.</p>

<p>Most of us know when we’re stressed. Physical cues like stomach butterflies, a flushed face, or muscle tension are hard to miss. Problem is, said symptoms can be very difficult to control. Once going—these things tend to snowball.</p>
<p>The <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/484175508/the-pip-a-biosensor-that-helps-you-relax-through-p?ref=category\">PIP biosensor Kickstarter</a> aims to help folks mediate stress by objectively measuring symptoms, digitally visualizing the results, and then gamifying stress reduction. It’s the latest in an avalanche of sensors aiming to increase body awareness and health.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Aio2JTpM29E\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>How does it work? The PIP measures Galvanic Skin Response—or changes in the skin’s conductivity as a stressful situation sends the heart racing and activates the sweat glands. The biosensor, held between thumb and forefinger, relays this information by bluetooth to a mobile device (Android or iOS) where an app interprets and displays it.</p>
<p>Folks interact with one of three games designed to develop biofeedback and thereby gain “conscious control over an aspect of their psycho-physiological state.” By gamifying the experience, people are motivated to play repeatedly, figure out what works, what doesn’t, and improve along the way.</p>
<p>The various pledge levels include the PIP device, games, and for top tier contributors, a trip to Ireland (no flight but two nights in a posh Dublin hotel) to meet the team, brainstorm the PIP’s future, and celebrate over a few pints at the pub. If the $100,000 goal is funded, the team hopes to deliver the devices by February, 2014.</p>
<p>It’s a cool idea, but the PIP isn’t entirely novel. Meditation is that other self-awareness “game” that’s been played for a few millennia. Thing is, meditation isn’t for everyone and can be challenging to master. Maybe by way of a few modern tricks, PIP proves the ideal gateway device to a more enlightened populace, or at the very least, a more relaxed one.</p>

You are here to change the world.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dugan is referring to Singularity University’s Graduate Studies Program (GSP) which kicked off last week in Mountain View California. The GSP gathers 80 talented students, this year from 33 countries, for the purpose of creating start up companies that will positively impact the lives of 1 billion people within ten years. Previous GSP participants have <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/companies/\">started dozens of companies that are now making an impact as part of Singularity Labs</a>, and more are sure to come out of this year’s class.  Over the course of the next ten weeks, students will hear over 500 hours of lectures from nobel prize winners, CEO’s, serial entrepreneurs, government leaders, and leading edge researchers.</p>
<p>If you are a <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/membership-signup/\">Singularity Hub member</a> you will be able to see a video of the entire opening ceremony in our <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/video-central/\">video central</a> soon.  Here is a small peak at the opening ceremony:</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/93Ex79Pzv9Q\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Now in its 5th year, each GSP begins with a “Global Grand Challenge Week,” an introductory seminar to introduce a range of problem areas including poverty, global health, education, security, environmental issues, water, and energy. Next, students spend several weeks learning across several exponential technologies seeing massive improvements in price in performance; areas like biotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, 3D printing, medicine, and computing. The goal is to leverage these technologies in a favorable way and create companies that change the world for the better.</p>
<p>“Today a guy or a gal in a garage with access to one of these exponential technologies can touch the lives of billions on our planet,” pointed out Singularity University co-founder Peter Diamandis. “We have a moral obligation to create a world of opportunity for everyone on earth.”</p>
<p>Dr. Ray Kurzweil, co-founder and chancellor of Singularity University, was on hand to share his unique perspectives on exponential growth as well. Kurzweil has built a sterling reputation for precision accuracy in futures forecasting and technology predictions. “The world of information technology moves exponentially, and this gives me great reason for optimism,” said Kurzweil. “The world today looks nothing like it did 40 years ago and the world in 10 years will look nothing like it looks today. You all have an opportunity to create that world.”</p>
<p>“You all are doer dreamers, and I love doer dreamers,” Dr Dugan said in her closing remarks. Dr. Dugan’s final words, greeted with a standing ovation and booming applause capture the essence of the evening and offer appropriate guidance to this summer’s Graduate Studies Class. “The world has enough doers who aren’t able to dream and dreamers who are afraid to build. You all have chosen to build. Now go out and build some epic shit!”</p>

<p>Remember watching Boston Dynamics’ <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/09/10/boston-dynamics-robot-cheetah-outruns-swiftest-human/\">Cheetah robot</a> outrun Usain Bolt? Meet its little cousin, <a href=\"http://biorob.epfl.ch/cheetah\">Cheetah-cub</a>, built by EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory (Biorob). Being just a cub, it’s no Usain Bolt, but Biorob believes it’s the fastest robot of its kind.</p>
<p>Cheetah-cub is about 21 centimeters long and weighs a kilogram—roughly the same size as its namesake or, less provocatively, a common house cat. Its top speed is about 3.2 miles per hour, or seven body lengths a second.</p>
<p>Unlike the Boston Dynamics cheetah robot, Cheetah-cub more closely mimics the real thing with its spring-loaded, three-segment legs (also called “pantograph” legs).</p>
<p>Biorob attributes Cheetah-cub’s self-stabilizing gait—even at top speed—to its biomimetic leg segmentation and stride pattern. In contrast, the Boston Dynamics bot goes fast but is fairly stiff and still requires a stabilizing boom to keep it centered.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/UWlzMIl7E48\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Cheetah-cub builds on another Biorob creation, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/27/amphibious-salamander-like-robot-swims-in-water-crawls-on-land/\">Amphibot</a>, by employing central pattern generators. CPGs are specially engineered, neuron-inspired circuits capable of producing complex leg movements from simple commands from the robot’s “brain.”</p>
<p>All this is electrically controlled by an external power source, requiring a power cable.</p>
<p>Like many quadrupedal robots, Biorob says future applications may include sending these robots where other machines on wheels or tracks can’t go—for example, rough terrain on emergency or reconnaissance missions. At a trot, the robot can successfully navigate steps up to 20% of its leg length.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-wcSdiQWfUA\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>The EPFL team built the robot using mostly off-the-shelf parts, as opposed to expensive custom components. Cheetah-cub is cheap, tough, and easily assembled which, added to its other attributes, makes it a useful research design.</p>
<p>Most of all, it’s fun to watch these guys trundle around and imagine that, no matter how advanced they are now, no matter how crucial a stepping stone this research is—they’ll probably look comically awkward in a decade.</p>

<p>It’s no secret Google’s building a high-tech portfolio beyond search, from self-driving cars to artificial intelligence. But they’re also quietly building something else entirely—a futuristic new campus at NASA Moffett Field. Though the firm has been rather reserved about their new Bay View campus, a panel of designers and architects involved in the project recently gave a talk at NASA, a stone’s throw from <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/\">Singularity University</a>.</p>
<p>Down for the afternoon, I popped in to hear the gospel.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Googleplex has been well adapted to house the titan of search, but it is not a Google creation from the ground up. Said another way, that particular algorithm has not yet been optimized. So, the firm decided to undertake a building project more suitably ambitious and principled—a building of the future synthesizing the most cutting edge technology of the present.</p>
<p>Cheryl Barton, founder and creative director of SF green landscape design firm <a href=\"http://www.toocb.com/\">O|CB</a>, said, “We’re raising the bar for corporate campuses. If you’re thinking forward a hundred years, you’ve got to be a gamechanger.”</p>
<p>Like Google’s other offices, the Bay View campus will be stocked with cafes, food, and fun. But when you’re building something from the ground up, you get to arrange the structures any way you like. The buildings on the new campus are jointed, bending them around each other and central open spaces.</p>
<p>The configuration places every employee about three minutes from every other employee and encourages serendipitous interaction. If workers feel like getting somewhere more quickly, there’ll be an elevated infinity loop bike track connecting the buildings. Google’s director of campus development, John Igoe, said the goal is to create a “frictionless environment” that allows folks to focus on work.</p>
<p>Central to that vision is interior and exterior design. Indoor workspaces will be open and naturally lit whenever possible—the lighting will be dimmed or off 77% of the year. There will be no recirculated air inside. And indoor spaces will use radiant heating and cooling transmitted via a network of water pipes and warmed in part by waste heat from the buildings’ refrigeration systems.</p>
<p>All this will be powered by large scale solar (presumably not exclusively) and aims to be 46% more energy efficient than the San Francisco Bay Area average.</p>
<p>That’s the interior. What about outside?</p>
<p>Google wants the Bay View campus to work in harmony with its natural surroundings. The 2.5 acre footprint comprises only 6% of the total 42 acre site. And though the central buildings offer 1.1 million square feet of indoor office space, architectural design firm <a href=\"http://www.nbbj.com/\">NBBJ</a> added five “outdoor rooms.”</p>
<p>The design of these rooms was driven by data, a detailed study of how heat and wind flow through the area and how shade and sunlight change throughout the year.</p>
<p>The piazza will be a thriving center of activity with coffee and food trucks. The university-inspired quad will be a place to eat lunch, mingle, or host events. The garden and overlook are contemplative, landscaped outdoor rooms overlooking the bay—open places to inspire innovation or seek a moment’s silence for its own sake.</p>
<p>The wildest of these “rooms” will be an area of regenerated freshwater wetlands. Barton said a big part of the project was “taking the pulse of the site.” According to NBBJ’s Ryan Mullenix, 1/3 of the bay had been filled in by 1960 and 90% of the naturally occurring wetlands destroyed. There’s no going back, but the firm can reverse the hands of time somewhat by reintroducing wetlands onsite.</p>
<p>And in fact, these wetlands will fulfill multiple purposes, creating a positive employee experience, improving the site, and providing sustainable, green water management. Josiah Cain of <a href=\"http://www.sherwoodengineers.com/projects_streetscape.html\">Sherwood Design Engineers</a> said that together with a series of green roofs and green walls, the wetlands will also act as a natural filter for stormwater and wastewater.</p>
<p>The Q&A was short, but one local worker questioned Google’s traffic and parking plans. As many as 4,000 Google employees may descend on Moffett Field, paired with only around 2,200 parking spaces. And although they plan to widen a central access road to the complex, those already working in the area wonder whether it will be enough.</p>
<p>Igoe’s answer? Google doesn’t think the current passenger car paradigm will last. He said the firm wants 50% of its workforce to arrive by bus or bike. (Anyone who’s lived in San Francisco for any period knows well the fleet of Google buses invading the city during commuting hours.) In particular, they’d like to up the bike-to-work folks from 5% to 20%, although he didn’t elaborate on how they’ll arrive at that number.</p>
<p>It’s a big project and a costly one to boot. But Igoe wouldn’t say how much exactly—just that they took the original cost of the Googleplex, added inflation and a Google factor (for cutting-edge tech), and arrived at a competitive cost.</p>
<p>Let’s just say, not cheap but possibly very cool. And as the years pass, those tech-induced efficiency gains will likely help defray steep up-front costs.</p>

Hill" "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 16:14:31 +0000" "<p>Sometimes it’s the simplest of explanations that can change your whole perspective…at least, that’s what statistics guru Hans Rosling hopes to achieve in a new video.</p>
<p>Rosling, who is a professor of global health at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and frequent TED speaker, has been pushing data analysis at audiences for years using stunning visuals and impassioned presentations in an effort to disrupt popular yet erroneous mindsets of global issues. In 2010, he stated, “I kid you not, statistics are now the sexiest subject on the planet,” backing that statement up <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/12/09/hans-rosling-shows-you-200-years-of-global-growth-in-4-minutes-video/\">with an awesome augmented-reality fueled video for <em>The Joy of Stats</em> BBC documentary</a>.</p>
<p>The new video from Rosling, however, aims to distill the grand challenges facing the world in as straightforward and low tech approach as possible – with LEGOs. Check out the video, courtesy of <em>The Guardian</em>:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SxbprYyjyyU?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Rosling’s message is that population growth can only be managed by both improving the living standards of the poorest in the world and persuading the wealthiest to embrace better resource distribution. In other words, somehow the increasing trend toward socioeconomic divergence must be reversed — easier said than done.</p>
<p>Perhaps Rosling will be able to release more videos in the future with proposals to these global grand challenges using LEGOs, but next time, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/04/12/six-of-the-best-robot-videos-of-lego-mindstorms-nxt/\">he just might have to use <em>Mindstorms</em></a>.</p>

<p>From <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/21/space-exploration-on-the-cheap-kickstarter-sensation-ardusat-by-nanosatisfi-launches-in-2013/\">Ardusat</a> to <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/29/diamandis-and-planetary-resources-to-build-first-crowdfunded-public-space-telescope/\">ARKYD</a>, space startups are bringing space exploration and participation down to Earth. How? Thanks to years of microchip and sensor miniaturization, we are now making useful satellites shockingly tiny, powerful, and affordable. And recently, one design in particular, the CubeSat, has become near-ubiquitous in the race to throw open the door to space exploration.</p>
<p>According to the Space Review, as many CubeSats as have been launched in their history (<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/09/picosatellites\">50 or so</a>) are planned for launch this year (<a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2155/1\">50 to 70</a>). These days, launching a CubeSat falls within most university research budgets. And indeed, universities make up the majority of launches, though well-heeled or Kickstarter-funded students, hobbyists, and artists aren’t priced out of the equation either.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_54777\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SH-11_MiniSats-Media-22.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54777\" title=\"SH 11_MiniSats (Media) #2\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SH-11_MiniSats-Media-22.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (SSOD) used to release CubeSats from the International Space Station. Credit: NASA</p></div>
<p>The base CubeSat is 10 centimeters to a side and, depending on what you put in it, weighs up to a kilogram. CubeSats are designed to be scalable along one axis. A 2U satellite is 20 centimeters long, 3U is 30 centimeters long, and so forth.</p>
<p>Anyone can put a small satellite into orbit if they can figure out how to engineer it and pay for the ride. The only regulatory requirement in the US is a <a href=\"http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/CRSRA/generalFAQ.html\">NOAA license</a> for satellites that “sense” the Earth’s surface by way of “emitted, reflected, or diffracted” electromagnetic waves (think high powered cameras, radar, etc.).</p>
<p>Because CubeSats are a standard size and weight, they are compatible with <a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2155/1\">standard deployment systems</a> like the Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD). P-PODs accommodate three CubeSats and can be attached to rockets as secondary payloads, making it easier than ever to hitch a ride into orbit.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/50_AntgK8ZA\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Most of today’s CubeSats ride on other commercial or government rockets at a steep per pound launch cost. But as private rocket developers like <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/\">SpaceX</a> make cheaper rockets, we’re likely to see more affordable launches in the future. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, due to launch later this year, may <a href=\"http://www.nss.org/articles/falconheavy.html\">slash launch costs</a> to under $1,000/lb.</p>
<p>Building and programming decently powerful satellites is getting cheaper and easier too. Some CubeSats even <a href=\"http://www.sstl.co.uk/divisions/earth-observation-science/science-missions/strand-nanosatellite\">boast Android phones</a> for brains. Why build hardware from scratch when smartphones contain miniature “sensors, cameras, GPS, batteries, accelerometers, compasses, [and] data storage”?</p>
<p>Or even better, if you backed the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space\">ArduSat Kickstarter</a> last year, $150 bought you a timeslot to steer their CubeSat and take 15 pictures from orbit. Or $325 booked satellite time to upload and run an experiment, application, or game using the satellite’s CPU and suite of sensors. (We visited ArduSat creator Nanosatisfi’s San Francisco workshop late last year. See <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/21/space-exploration-on-the-cheap-kickstarter-sensation-ardusat-by-nanosatisfi-launches-in-2013/\">here</a> for more.)</p>
<p>What other creative uses are folks finding for CubeSats?</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.interorbital.com/\">Interorbital Systems</a>, a space exploration company that specializes in small satellites, offers a <a href=\"http://interorbital.com/interorbital_062313_002.htm\">list of applications</a> including imaging, research, space art, and space burials. The Japanese FITSAT-1 has been <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/japanese-satellite-fitsat-1-morse-code-space_n_2615110.html\">flashing morse code</a> from orbit since late last year. Project Calliope <a href=\"http://projectcalliope.com/\">will convert</a> the ionosphere into free sound files for all to hear and perhaps mix and remix into music.</p>
<p>Maybe these seem a bit frivolous. But the fact there’s even room for frivolity is hugely promising. The more small satellites we can engineer and launch, the better and faster we can hone our designs. As space research moves beyond the elite few, the pace of space technology will accelerate. It’s about time, don’t you think?</p>

<p>After a successful Kickstarter and this year’s delivery of Rift headsets to developers, Oculus recently <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/vr-gets-vc/\">secured $16 million</a> in Series A funding to keep the wheels turning. Four venture capital firms (Spark Capital, Matrix Partners, Founders Fund, and Formation 8) contributed funds to take Oculus mainstream.</p>
<p>Gaming’s biggest names just released their “next generation” systems, and there are all kinds of neat additions. But they’re still building on the old model. Oculus, meanwhile, offers a fundamentally different experience.</p>
<p>When the Rift, an immersive virtual reality headset, first hit the tech community, it was but a bootstrapped pair of ski goggles with a screen hacked together in a garage. Rudimentary or no, the system impressed game developer royalty, avid gamers, and journalists alike.</p>
<p>The firm directed all that excitement into a $2.4 million Kickstarter and funded a manufacturing run for developers. Less obvious, but no less important, the Kickstarter is bringing a round of testing and feedback from professional game developers, a growing roster of VR-tailored games, and perhaps most valuable, credibility in the developer community.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-143_2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64141\" alt=\"SH 143_#2\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-143_2.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"318\" /></a></p>
<p>In roughly eighteen months, Oculus has blossomed from a guy in a garage to a <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/company/people/\">24-person team</a> of top gaming talent that’s manufactured and shipped their first devices. But it doesn’t end there. The final audience isn’t only the tech savviest. Quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Oculus is questing for a glitch-free, user friendly, immersive virtual reality experience for all of us. But to do that, they need investors. Which is why it’s a good thing they’ve got a story that virtually sells itself, a proven piece of hardware, a growing store of crowdsourced software, and a manufacturing run in their pocket.</p>
<p>Oculus raised $16 million in their initial round, and one imagines, if needed, there’s more where that came from. On the <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/vr-gets-vc/\">company blog</a>, Oculus founder, Palmer Luckey, wrote that the cash infusion should open doors for the firm.</p>
<p>“[This funding] helps us hire the best and brightest minds in VR from around the world. It lets us experiment and prototype with more cutting-edge tech. And it allows us to build a badass, consumer VR gaming platform, the likes of which the world has never seen.”</p>
<p>If all goes to plan (and as always, that’s a big if), it’s the kind of story you might expect in a Peter Diamandis keynote in the not too distant future. The Rift is an excellent example of how much the little guy can do (and how fast) in our exponential economy.</p>
<p>So, how long will it be before you or I can purchase a Rift of our very own? Oculus still isn’t saying. But they continue tinkering and testing behind the scenes.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSboqL82fmw\">The company brought</a> a 1080p “HD VR” Rift headset with them to E3. Though the pixels aren’t entirely undetectable, the higher def screen made them less obvious. Remember, 1080p is great from eight feet away, but the Rift display is only inches from your eyes.</p>
<p>The team is also reportedly still working on positional tracking (not just head tracking) for the consumer version. Nate Mitchell, VP of product, told <em>Tested</em>, “We’re not talking a wide, huge Kinect-type thing. But something that let’s you lean down and examine things in the game world.”</p>
<p>In the end, the not-so-quantifiable due date may be whenever Oculus gets the experience just right. There’s less room for error when you’re aiming a brand new piece of hardware at folks on their sofas. Not none, but less.</p>
<p>To really catch fire, a new product like the Rift ought to deliver an experience akin to tasting a deliciously unexpected combination of flavors at a fine restaurant. The moment forces you to close your eyes and savor. With the Rift, however, you might want to keep your eyes open and opt for a big grin instead.</p>

<p>Monsanto, the world’s largest seed company, recently reported the finding of unapproved genetically modified wheat in an Oregon field—and nobody knows where it came from. This is of concern, especially to farmers, but raises a larger question too. If genetic modification is the future, how will we control our creations?</p>
<p>The wheat at the center of this mystery was genetically modified to resist Monsanto’s herbicide, Roundup. The Oregon farmer discovered the plants growing in a fallow field and <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2013/05/finding_genetically_modified_w.html\">tried to kill</a> them with the widely-used herbicide. When they survived, he sent samples to Oregon State University where tests revealed it had been genetically modified to contain a Roundup resistant CP4/maize EPSPS gene. The USDA later confirmed these <a href=\"http://www.aphis.usda.gov/newsroom/2013/05/ge_wheat_detection.shtml\">findings</a>.</p>
<p>Although Monsanto got FDA approval for the wheat in food, they withdrew their EPA application in 2004, due to farmers worried about the potential loss of markets in Europe and Asia. The firm ended field trials and never marketed the product.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64027 alignright\" alt=\"Monsanto_#4\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_4.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Since the wheat was found and tested, Monsanto has been on the offensive to control what’s fast became a public relations mess.</p>
<p>Chief technology officer, Robb Fraley, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-05/monsanto-says-rogue-wheat-didn-t-contaminate-oregon-seed.html\">noted to the press</a> that the unapproved plants were found growing on less than one percent of the farmer’s 125-acre field, and Monsanto’s subsequent tests showed no sign of cross-contamination.</p>
<p>“It seems likely to be a random, isolated occurrence more consistent with the accidental or purposeful mixing of a small amount of seed during the planting, harvesting or during the fallow cycle in an individual field.”</p>
<p>The firm <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-05/monsanto-says-rogue-wheat-didn-t-contaminate-oregon-seed.html\">stopped planting</a> Roundup Ready wheat in Oregon over 12 years ago, the seeds are only viable for two years in the soil, and this is the first incident since trials ended in 2005. Monsanto isn’t implicating the farmer, but they aren’t ruling out a deliberate act of sabotage by someone else.</p>
<p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130621/us-genetically-modified-wheat/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics\">have postponed</a> imports of US white wheat from the region while they continue to study information from US officials. Meanwhile, citing economic damages, Monsanto <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-07/monsanto-sued-on-behalf-of-farmers-over-modified-wheat.html\">has been sued</a> by an environmental group and Washington farm and another group in Kansas.</p>
<p>Heading up the Washington lawsuit, the Center for Food Safety <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-07/monsanto-sued-on-behalf-of-farmers-over-modified-wheat.html\">stated</a>, “Because scheduled shipments already have been postponed and canceled, the presence of genetically engineered wheat has detrimentally impacted the domestic and global wheat markets and damaged plaintiffs and other wheat farmers.”</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64032 alignleft\" alt=\"Monsanto_#3\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_3.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Whether Monsanto is to blame or they’re the victim—how we control genetically modified plants or other organisms is a futuristic debate beginning in the here and now.</p>
<p>There are benefits to genetically modified crops. These include resistance to herbicides, diseases, and pests, better yield, increased shelf-life, and the potential for biofuel production. But opponents question whether genetically modified crops are safe, environmentally friendly, and whether genetically modified crops are really needed to address the world’s food needs.</p>
<p>Although, in this case, it appears the wheat did not spread, it can be difficult to predict the impact genetically modified organisms will have once released into the world at large.</p>
<p>It’s generally in Monsanto’s interest to avoid such errors. But clearly they are not immune. And perhaps a worse outcome is when the Monsantos of the world lose control of their product, inadvertently or via sabotage, as appears happened in this case.</p>
<p>With rapid advancement of knowledge and expertise in biotechnology, there’s great potential to do good. However, incidents like this underline the fact that no good thing is risk-free. As genetic modification continues, expect more such controversies—and hopefully, in their wake, better safeguards.</p>

<p>From <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/21/space-exploration-on-the-cheap-kickstarter-sensation-ardusat-by-nanosatisfi-launches-in-2013/\">Ardusat</a> to <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/29/diamandis-and-planetary-resources-to-build-first-crowdfunded-public-space-telescope/\">ARKYD</a>, space startups are bringing space exploration and participation down to Earth. How? Thanks to years of microchip and sensor miniaturization, we are now making useful satellites shockingly tiny, powerful, and affordable. And recently, one design in particular, the CubeSat, has become near-ubiquitous in the race to throw open the door to space exploration.</p>
<p>According to the Space Review, as many CubeSats as have been launched in their history (<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/09/picosatellites\">50 or so</a>) are planned for launch this year (<a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2155/1\">50 to 70</a>). These days, launching a CubeSat falls within most university research budgets. And indeed, universities make up the majority of launches, though well-heeled or Kickstarter-funded students, hobbyists, and artists aren’t priced out of the equation either.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_54777\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SH-11_MiniSats-Media-22.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54777\" title=\"SH 11_MiniSats (Media) #2\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SH-11_MiniSats-Media-22.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (SSOD) used to release CubeSats from the International Space Station.

<p>The base CubeSat is 10 centimeters to a side and, depending on what you put in it, weighs up to a kilogram. CubeSats are designed to be scalable along one axis. A 2U satellite is 20 centimeters long, 3U is 30 centimeters long, and so forth.</p>
<p>Anyone can put a small satellite into orbit if they can figure out how to engineer it and pay for the ride. The only regulatory requirement in the US is a <a href=\"http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/CRSRA/generalFAQ.html\">NOAA license</a> for satellites that “sense” the Earth’s surface by way of “emitted, reflected, or diffracted” electromagnetic waves (think high powered cameras, radar, etc.).</p>
<p>Because CubeSats are a standard size and weight, they are compatible with <a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2155/1\">standard deployment systems</a> like the Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD). P-PODs accommodate three CubeSats and can be attached to rockets as secondary payloads, making it easier than ever to hitch a ride into orbit.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/50_AntgK8ZA\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Most of today’s CubeSats ride on other commercial or government rockets at a steep per pound launch cost. But as private rocket developers like <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/\">SpaceX</a> make cheaper rockets, we’re likely to see more affordable launches in the future. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, due to launch later this year, may <a href=\"http://www.nss.org/articles/falconheavy.html\">slash launch costs</a> to under $1,000/lb.</p>
<p>Building and programming decently powerful satellites is getting cheaper and easier too. Some CubeSats even <a href=\"http://www.sstl.co.uk/divisions/earth-observation-science/science-missions/strand-nanosatellite\">boast Android phones</a> for brains. Why build hardware from scratch when smartphones contain miniature “sensors, cameras, GPS, batteries, accelerometers, compasses, [and] data storage”?</p>
<p>Or even better, if you backed the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space\">ArduSat Kickstarter</a> last year, $150 bought you a timeslot to steer their CubeSat and take 15 pictures from orbit. Or $325 booked satellite time to upload and run an experiment, application, or game using the satellite’s CPU and suite of sensors. (We visited ArduSat creator Nanosatisfi’s San Francisco workshop late last year. See <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/21/space-exploration-on-the-cheap-kickstarter-sensation-ardusat-by-nanosatisfi-launches-in-2013/\">here</a> for more.)</p>
<p>What other creative uses are folks finding for CubeSats?</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.interorbital.com/\">Interorbital Systems</a>, a space exploration company that specializes in small satellites, offers a <a href=\"http://interorbital.com/interorbital_062313_002.htm\">list of applications</a> including imaging, research, space art, and space burials. The Japanese FITSAT-1 has been <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/japanese-satellite-fitsat-1-morse-code-space_n_2615110.html\">flashing morse code</a> from orbit since late last year. Project Calliope <a href=\"http://projectcalliope.com/\">will convert</a> the ionosphere into free sound files for all to hear and perhaps mix and remix into music.</p>
<p>Maybe these seem a bit frivolous. But the fact there’s even room for frivolity is hugely promising. The more small satellites we can engineer and launch, the better and faster we can hone our designs. As space research moves beyond the elite few, the pace of space technology will accelerate. It’s about time, don’t you think?</p>

<p>The name of China’s newest supercomputer, Tianhe-2, translates to MilkyWay-2. It’s a fitting moniker, maybe even a modest one. There are an estimated 300 billion stars in our galaxy. Tianhe-2 can run 100,000 times as many calculations <i>per second</i> as there are stars in the sky. Tianhe-2 is now <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">the fastest computer</a> on Earth, doubling the speed of its American rival, Titan—and it arrived two years ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>How did Tianhe-2 knock out Titan? Put simply, it’s a brute. Tianhe-2 uses six times as many cores (3.1 million) and twice the power (17.8 MW) as Titan to achieve double the speed (33.86 petaflop/s).</p>
<p>No single machine has held the top spot for more than one cycle since Japan’s K computer in 2011, and China hasn’t had the leading computer since Tianhe-2′s predecessor, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/11/07/china-owns-the-fastest-supercomputer-now-what-video/\">Tianhe-1a</a>. When completed, Tianhe-2’s theoretical peak performance will be 54.9 petaflop/s. That mark may stand for a little while. The US, at least, has no plans to build another supercomputer <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/159465-chinas-tianhe-2-supercomputer-twice-as-fast-as-does-titan-shocks-the-world-by-arriving-two-years-early\">until 2015</a>.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SH-144_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64042 alignright\" alt=\"SH 144_#2\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SH-144_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a></p>
<p>China is now a recognized supercomputing power. The country boasts <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">66 machines</a> on the Top500, over twice Japan’s 30 and a total second only to the US. Top500 editor, Jack Dongarra, who toured the Tianhe-2 facility and <a href=\"http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/tianhe-2-dongarra-report.pdf\">wrote a paper</a> on the supercomputer earlier this year, says it’s notable that, apart from its processors and coprocessors, Tianhe-2 is entirely of Chinese make.</p>
<p>“Most of the features of the system were developed in China, and they are only using Intel for the main compute part. That is, the interconnect, operating system, front-end processors and software are mainly Chinese.”</p>
<p>Even as China’s star is on the rise, the US remains undisputed hegemon. The US is home to <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">252 supercomputers</a>, or 50% of the Top500 list, and American companies IBM, Cray, Nvidia, and Intel still provide the hardware and know-how behind most of the world’s fastest machines.</p>
<p>Tianhe-2 and Titan are at the bleeding edge of supercomputing, but <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">total power</a> is growing fast too. Whereas there was only one supercomputer processing petaflop/s in 2008, there now are 26 such systems, up from 23 last November. And the list’s combined computing power is 223 petaflop/s, up from 123 petaflop/s a year ago.</p>
<p>If supercomputers continue along their current trajectory, sometime around 2018—maybe a little later—the world’s fastest computer will breach the exaflop/s barrier. That’s five times faster than the entire June 2013 list <i>combined.</i></p>
<div id=\"attachment_64072\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SH-144_31.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64072\" alt=\"SH 144_#3\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SH-144_31.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"395\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source Data: <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/lists/\">Top500</a></p></div>
<p>What will we do with all that speed?</p>
<p>The <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/26/quest-to-model-the-human-brain-nets-a-billion-euros/\">Human Brain Project</a>, recently funded to the tune of a billion euros, plans to use exascale computing to build a complete digital model of the brain. The <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/12/03/australian-outback-launches-fastest-radio-telescope-in-the-world/\">Square Kilometer Array</a> radio telescope will use an exascale computer to link a 3,000 kilometer array, 50 times as sensitive and 10,000 times faster than any telescope in existence today.</p>
<p>All that says nothing of ordinary desktop, laptop, or (more likely) mobile computing. If today’s personal devices are speedier than a supercomputer from a couple decades ago, perhaps we’ll carry petaflop/s power in our pocket, glasses, or contact lenses twenty years from now.</p>
<p>Jason Silva says modern telescopes “extend the optic nerve of humanity.” But our brains are the more powerful organ, sitting behind the optic nerve and interpreting its input. Modern supercomputers are the brain’s James Webb. They extend, expand, accelerate, and augment our mental powers—the universe’s greatest trick yet.</p>

<p>Andrew Johnson, or Cyber-AJ, is one of  <a href=\"http://www.pdf.org/en/parkinson_statistics\">10 million people</a> suffering from Parkinson’s Disease (PD) worldwide. The disease is progressive, and it is devastating.</p>
<p>Diagnosed four years ago, Johnson recently described himself as a “39 year old trapped in an 89-year-old body.” But earlier this year, his life was transformed by a technique increasingly prescribed to a subset of PD patients called deep brain stimulation (DBS).</p>
<p>In February, Johnson underwent the second of two surgeries to implant a neurostimulator in his brain. The neurostimulator is about the <a href=\"http://www.parkinson.org/Parkinson-s-Disease/Treatment/Surgical-Treatment-Options/Deep-Brain-Stimulation\">size of a stopwatch</a>, is internally wired to a pacemaker in his chest, and once switched on by a handheld remote, the device’s electrical current jams the misbehaving neurons responsible for PD’s physical symptoms.</p>
<p>Since the surgery, Johnson’s life has been better. A lot better. In a recent video posted on his blog, <a href=\"http://youngandshaky.com/\">youngandshaky.com</a>, Johnson demonstrates the power of his new device by running an experiment on camera—he turns off the juice.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/uBh2LxTW0s0\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>It’s really a remarkable video. Johnson struggles to speak and is on the verge of dropping the remote when he switches the current back on. Almost instantaneously, his tremors subside. It’s difficult not to share that deepest of deep breaths he draws into his lungs. Discomfort eased, his relief is palpable.</p>
<p>But the surgery was no walk in the park. Afterward, Johnson says he was in “obscene amounts of pain” where the “slightest whisper was like a dagger to the skull.”</p>
<p>After a few days, his medical team began adjusting the device and dialing in the optimal level of current. A strange sensation, he says, but pleasurable, as his body came “alive again after being cased in concrete for so long.”</p>
<p>For patients like Johnson, DBS can deliver dramatic results, but it <a href=\"http://www.parkinson.org/NationalParkinsonFoundation/files/0d/0dc56c7a-01b9-4533-80f5-9963901a2bb4.pdf\">isn’t appropriate</a> for everyone, nor is the surgery <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/23/deep-brain-stimulation-used-to-treat-early-stage-parkinsons-disease/\">risk-free</a>.</p>
<p>As Johnson warns on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/06/25/195521917/the-man-with-a-battery-operated-brain?ft=1&f=1007\">his blog</a>, “This is not a miracle cure, it is a proven treatment which happened to work for me quite spectacularly, but that was because a subset of my symptoms were ones most likely to respond to the surgery.”</p>
<p>Those wondering whether DBS might work for them should consult their doctor. But when diagnosed and targeted accurately, in combination with medication, DBS can radically reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients and their families.</p>
<p>Even with an as yet incomplete understanding of what goes on between our ears, modern neuroscience is delivering life-changing improvements for some patients.</p>
<p>As research continues, such treatments may become more commonly prescribed and increasingly effective. Cyber-AJ and his “battery operated brain” exemplify the inspiring combination of man, machine, and modern science.</p>

<p>Most of us know when we’re stressed. Physical cues like stomach butterflies, a flushed face, or muscle tension are hard to miss. Problem is, said symptoms can be very difficult to control. Once going—these things tend to snowball.</p>
<p>The <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/484175508/the-pip-a-biosensor-that-helps-you-relax-through-p?ref=category\">PIP biosensor Kickstarter</a> aims to help folks mediate stress by objectively measuring symptoms, digitally visualizing the results, and then gamifying stress reduction. It’s the latest in an avalanche of sensors aiming to increase body awareness and health.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Aio2JTpM29E\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>How does it work? The PIP measures Galvanic Skin Response—or changes in the skin’s conductivity as a stressful situation sends the heart racing and activates the sweat glands. The biosensor, held between thumb and forefinger, relays this information by bluetooth to a mobile device (Android or iOS) where an app interprets and displays it.</p>
<p>Folks interact with one of three games designed to develop biofeedback and thereby gain “conscious control over an aspect of their psycho-physiological state.” By gamifying the experience, people are motivated to play repeatedly, figure out what works, what doesn’t, and improve along the way.</p>
<p>The various pledge levels include the PIP device, games, and for top tier contributors, a trip to Ireland (no flight but two nights in a posh Dublin hotel) to meet the team, brainstorm the PIP’s future, and celebrate over a few pints at the pub. If the $100,000 goal is funded, the team hopes to deliver the devices by February, 2014.</p>
<p>It’s a cool idea, but the PIP isn’t entirely novel. Meditation is that other self-awareness “game” that’s been played for a few millennia. Thing is, meditation isn’t for everyone and can be challenging to master. Maybe by way of a few modern tricks, PIP proves the ideal gateway device to a more enlightened populace, or at the very least, a more relaxed one.</p>

You are here to change the world.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dugan is referring to Singularity University’s Graduate Studies Program (GSP) which kicked off last week in Mountain View California. The GSP gathers 80 talented students, this year from 33 countries, for the purpose of creating start up companies that will positively impact the lives of 1 billion people within ten years. Previous GSP participants have <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/companies/\">started dozens of companies that are now making an impact as part of Singularity Labs</a>, and more are sure to come out of this year’s class.  Over the course of the next ten weeks, students will hear over 500 hours of lectures from nobel prize winners, CEO’s, serial entrepreneurs, government leaders, and leading edge researchers.</p>
<p>If you are a <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/membership-signup/\">Singularity Hub member</a> you will be able to see a video of the entire opening ceremony in our <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/video-central/\">video central</a> soon.  Here is a small peak at the opening ceremony:</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/93Ex79Pzv9Q\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Now in its 5th year, each GSP begins with a “Global Grand Challenge Week,” an introductory seminar to introduce a range of problem areas including poverty, global health, education, security, environmental issues, water, and energy. Next, students spend several weeks learning across several exponential technologies seeing massive improvements in price in performance; areas like biotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, 3D printing, medicine, and computing. The goal is to leverage these technologies in a favorable way and create companies that change the world for the better.</p>
<p>“Today a guy or a gal in a garage with access to one of these exponential technologies can touch the lives of billions on our planet,” pointed out Singularity University co-founder Peter Diamandis. “We have a moral obligation to create a world of opportunity for everyone on earth.”</p>
<p>Dr. Ray Kurzweil, co-founder and chancellor of Singularity University, was on hand to share his unique perspectives on exponential growth as well. Kurzweil has built a sterling reputation for precision accuracy in futures forecasting and technology predictions. “The world of information technology moves exponentially, and this gives me great reason for optimism,” said Kurzweil. “The world today looks nothing like it did 40 years ago and the world in 10 years will look nothing like it looks today. You all have an opportunity to create that world.”</p>
<p>“You all are doer dreamers, and I love doer dreamers,” Dr Dugan said in her closing remarks. Dr. Dugan’s final words, greeted with a standing ovation and booming applause capture the essence of the evening and offer appropriate guidance to this summer’s Graduate Studies Class. “The world has enough doers who aren’t able to dream and dreamers who are afraid to build. You all have chosen to build. Now go out and build some epic shit!”</p>

<p>Remember watching Boston Dynamics’ <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/09/10/boston-dynamics-robot-cheetah-outruns-swiftest-human/\">Cheetah robot</a> outrun Usain Bolt? Meet its little cousin, <a href=\"http://biorob.epfl.ch/cheetah\">Cheetah-cub</a>, built by EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory (Biorob). Being just a cub, it’s no Usain Bolt, but Biorob believes it’s the fastest robot of its kind.</p>
<p>Cheetah-cub is about 21 centimeters long and weighs a kilogram—roughly the same size as its namesake or, less provocatively, a common house cat. Its top speed is about 3.2 miles per hour, or seven body lengths a second.</p>
<p>Unlike the Boston Dynamics cheetah robot, Cheetah-cub more closely mimics the real thing with its spring-loaded, three-segment legs (also called “pantograph” legs).</p>
<p>Biorob attributes Cheetah-cub’s self-stabilizing gait—even at top speed—to its biomimetic leg segmentation and stride pattern. In contrast, the Boston Dynamics bot goes fast but is fairly stiff and still requires a stabilizing boom to keep it centered.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/UWlzMIl7E48\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Cheetah-cub builds on another Biorob creation, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/27/amphibious-salamander-like-robot-swims-in-water-crawls-on-land/\">Amphibot</a>, by employing central pattern generators. CPGs are specially engineered, neuron-inspired circuits capable of producing complex leg movements from simple commands from the robot’s “brain.”</p>
<p>All this is electrically controlled by an external power source, requiring a power cable.</p>
<p>Like many quadrupedal robots, Biorob says future applications may include sending these robots where other machines on wheels or tracks can’t go—for example, rough terrain on emergency or reconnaissance missions. At a trot, the robot can successfully navigate steps up to 20% of its leg length.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-wcSdiQWfUA\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>The EPFL team built the robot using mostly off-the-shelf parts, as opposed to expensive custom components. Cheetah-cub is cheap, tough, and easily assembled which, added to its other attributes, makes it a useful research design.</p>
<p>Most of all, it’s fun to watch these guys trundle around and imagine that, no matter how advanced they are now, no matter how crucial a stepping stone this research is—they’ll probably look comically awkward in a decade.</p>

<p>It’s no secret Google’s building a high-tech portfolio beyond search, from self-driving cars to artificial intelligence. But they’re also quietly building something else entirely—a futuristic new campus at NASA Moffett Field. Though the firm has been rather reserved about their new Bay View campus, a panel of designers and architects involved in the project recently gave a talk at NASA, a stone’s throw from <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/\">Singularity University</a>.</p>
<p>Down for the afternoon, I popped in to hear the gospel.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Googleplex has been well adapted to house the titan of search, but it is not a Google creation from the ground up. Said another way, that particular algorithm has not yet been optimized. So, the firm decided to undertake a building project more suitably ambitious and principled—a building of the future synthesizing the most cutting edge technology of the present.</p>
<p>Cheryl Barton, founder and creative director of SF green landscape design firm <a href=\"http://www.toocb.com/\">O|CB</a>, said, “We’re raising the bar for corporate campuses. If you’re thinking forward a hundred years, you’ve got to be a gamechanger.”</p>
<p>Like Google’s other offices, the Bay View campus will be stocked with cafes, food, and fun. But when you’re building something from the ground up, you get to arrange the structures any way you like. The buildings on the new campus are jointed, bending them around each other and central open spaces.</p>
<p>The configuration places every employee about three minutes from every other employee and encourages serendipitous interaction. If workers feel like getting somewhere more quickly, there’ll be an elevated infinity loop bike track connecting the buildings. Google’s director of campus development, John Igoe, said the goal is to create a “frictionless environment” that allows folks to focus on work.</p>
<p>Central to that vision is interior and exterior design. Indoor workspaces will be open and naturally lit whenever possible—the lighting will be dimmed or off 77% of the year. There will be no recirculated air inside. And indoor spaces will use radiant heating and cooling transmitted via a network of water pipes and warmed in part by waste heat from the buildings’ refrigeration systems.</p>
<p>All this will be powered by large scale solar (presumably not exclusively) and aims to be 46% more energy efficient than the San Francisco Bay Area average.</p>
<p>That’s the interior. What about outside?</p>
<p>Google wants the Bay View campus to work in harmony with its natural surroundings. The 2.5 acre footprint comprises only 6% of the total 42 acre site. And though the central buildings offer 1.1 million square feet of indoor office space, architectural design firm <a href=\"http://www.nbbj.com/\">NBBJ</a> added five “outdoor rooms.”</p>
<p>The design of these rooms was driven by data, a detailed study of how heat and wind flow through the area and how shade and sunlight change throughout the year.</p>
<p>The piazza will be a thriving center of activity with coffee and food trucks. The university-inspired quad will be a place to eat lunch, mingle, or host events. The garden and overlook are contemplative, landscaped outdoor rooms overlooking the bay—open places to inspire innovation or seek a moment’s silence for its own sake.</p>
<p>The wildest of these “rooms” will be an area of regenerated freshwater wetlands. Barton said a big part of the project was “taking the pulse of the site.” According to NBBJ’s Ryan Mullenix, 1/3 of the bay had been filled in by 1960 and 90% of the naturally occurring wetlands destroyed. There’s no going back, but the firm can reverse the hands of time somewhat by reintroducing wetlands onsite.</p>
<p>And in fact, these wetlands will fulfill multiple purposes, creating a positive employee experience, improving the site, and providing sustainable, green water management. Josiah Cain of <a href=\"http://www.sherwoodengineers.com/projects_streetscape.html\">Sherwood Design Engineers</a> said that together with a series of green roofs and green walls, the wetlands will also act as a natural filter for stormwater and wastewater.</p>
<p>The Q&A was short, but one local worker questioned Google’s traffic and parking plans. As many as 4,000 Google employees may descend on Moffett Field, paired with only around 2,200 parking spaces. And although they plan to widen a central access road to the complex, those already working in the area wonder whether it will be enough.</p>
<p>Igoe’s answer? Google doesn’t think the current passenger car paradigm will last. He said the firm wants 50% of its workforce to arrive by bus or bike. (Anyone who’s lived in San Francisco for any period knows well the fleet of Google buses invading the city during commuting hours.) In particular, they’d like to up the bike-to-work folks from 5% to 20%, although he didn’t elaborate on how they’ll arrive at that number.</p>
<p>It’s a big project and a costly one to boot. But Igoe wouldn’t say how much exactly—just that they took the original cost of the Googleplex, added inflation and a Google factor (for cutting-edge tech), and arrived at a competitive cost.</p>
<p>Let’s just say, not cheap but possibly very cool. And as the years pass, those tech-induced efficiency gains will likely help defray steep up-front costs.</p>

Hill" "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 16:14:31 +0000" "<p>Sometimes it’s the simplest of explanations that can change your whole perspective…at least, that’s what statistics guru Hans Rosling hopes to achieve in a new video.</p>
<p>Rosling, who is a professor of global health at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and frequent TED speaker, has been pushing data analysis at audiences for years using stunning visuals and impassioned presentations in an effort to disrupt popular yet erroneous mindsets of global issues. In 2010, he stated, “I kid you not, statistics are now the sexiest subject on the planet,” backing that statement up <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/12/09/hans-rosling-shows-you-200-years-of-global-growth-in-4-minutes-video/\">with an awesome augmented-reality fueled video for <em>The Joy of Stats</em> BBC documentary</a>.</p>
<p>The new video from Rosling, however, aims to distill the grand challenges facing the world in as straightforward and low tech approach as possible – with LEGOs. Check out the video, courtesy of <em>The Guardian</em>:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SxbprYyjyyU?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Rosling’s message is that population growth can only be managed by both improving the living standards of the poorest in the world and persuading the wealthiest to embrace better resource distribution. In other words, somehow the increasing trend toward socioeconomic divergence must be reversed — easier said than done.</p>
<p>Perhaps Rosling will be able to release more videos in the future with proposals to these global grand challenges using LEGOs, but next time, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/04/12/six-of-the-best-robot-videos-of-lego-mindstorms-nxt/\">he just might have to use <em>Mindstorms</em></a>.</p>

<p>From <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/21/space-exploration-on-the-cheap-kickstarter-sensation-ardusat-by-nanosatisfi-launches-in-2013/\">Ardusat</a> to <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/29/diamandis-and-planetary-resources-to-build-first-crowdfunded-public-space-telescope/\">ARKYD</a>, space startups are bringing space exploration and participation down to Earth. How? Thanks to years of microchip and sensor miniaturization, we are now making useful satellites shockingly tiny, powerful, and affordable. And recently, one design in particular, the CubeSat, has become near-ubiquitous in the race to throw open the door to space exploration.</p>
<p>According to the Space Review, as many CubeSats as have been launched in their history (<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/09/picosatellites\">50 or so</a>) are planned for launch this year (<a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2155/1\">50 to 70</a>). These days, launching a CubeSat falls within most university research budgets. And indeed, universities make up the majority of launches, though well-heeled or Kickstarter-funded students, hobbyists, and artists aren’t priced out of the equation either.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_54777\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SH-11_MiniSats-Media-22.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54777\" title=\"SH 11_MiniSats (Media) #2\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SH-11_MiniSats-Media-22.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (SSOD) used to release CubeSats from the International Space Station.

<p>The base CubeSat is 10 centimeters to a side and, depending on what you put in it, weighs up to a kilogram. CubeSats are designed to be scalable along one axis. A 2U satellite is 20 centimeters long, 3U is 30 centimeters long, and so forth.</p>
<p>Anyone can put a small satellite into orbit if they can figure out how to engineer it and pay for the ride. The only regulatory requirement in the US is a <a href=\"http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/CRSRA/generalFAQ.html\">NOAA license</a> for satellites that “sense” the Earth’s surface by way of “emitted, reflected, or diffracted” electromagnetic waves (think high powered cameras, radar, etc.).</p>
<p>Because CubeSats are a standard size and weight, they are compatible with <a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2155/1\">standard deployment systems</a> like the Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD). P-PODs accommodate three CubeSats and can be attached to rockets as secondary payloads, making it easier than ever to hitch a ride into orbit.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/50_AntgK8ZA\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Most of today’s CubeSats ride on other commercial or government rockets at a steep per pound launch cost. But as private rocket developers like <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/\">SpaceX</a> make cheaper rockets, we’re likely to see more affordable launches in the future. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, due to launch later this year, may <a href=\"http://www.nss.org/articles/falconheavy.html\">slash launch costs</a> to under $1,000/lb.</p>
<p>Building and programming decently powerful satellites is getting cheaper and easier too. Some CubeSats even <a href=\"http://www.sstl.co.uk/divisions/earth-observation-science/science-missions/strand-nanosatellite\">boast Android phones</a> for brains. Why build hardware from scratch when smartphones contain miniature “sensors, cameras, GPS, batteries, accelerometers, compasses, [and] data storage”?</p>
<p>Or even better, if you backed the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space\">ArduSat Kickstarter</a> last year, $150 bought you a timeslot to steer their CubeSat and take 15 pictures from orbit. Or $325 booked satellite time to upload and run an experiment, application, or game using the satellite’s CPU and suite of sensors. (We visited ArduSat creator Nanosatisfi’s San Francisco workshop late last year. See <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/21/space-exploration-on-the-cheap-kickstarter-sensation-ardusat-by-nanosatisfi-launches-in-2013/\">here</a> for more.)</p>
<p>What other creative uses are folks finding for CubeSats?</p>
<p>Interorbital Systems, a space exploration company that specializes in small satellites, offers a <a href=\"http://www.interorbital.com/interorbital_042713_002.htm\">list of applications</a> including imaging, research, space art, and space burials. The Japanese FITSAT-1 has been <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/japanese-satellite-fitsat-1-morse-code-space_n_2615110.html\">flashing morse code</a> from orbit since late last year. Project Calliope <a href=\"http://projectcalliope.com/\">will convert</a> the ionosphere into free sound files for all to hear and perhaps mix and remix into music.</p>
<p>Maybe these seem a bit frivolous. But the fact there’s even room for frivolity is hugely promising. The more small satellites we can engineer and launch, the better and faster we can hone our designs. As space research moves beyond the elite few, the pace of space technology will accelerate. It’s about time, don’t you think?</p>

<p>If Cisco and iRobot have their way, robot CEOs may invade boardrooms from Tokyo to New York in 2014. The two companies <a href=\"http://www.irobot.com/us/Company/Press_Center/Press_Releases/Press_Release.aspx?n=061013\">recently announced</a> collaboration on the autonomous Ava 500 telepresence robot for business. The firms hope the Ava 500 will allow business people to attend daily meetings in person, across the planet—without ever changing a plane or time zone.</p>
<p>The navigation technology behind iRobot’s Roomba robot vacuum cleaner and the <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/18/irobots-rp-vita-telepresence-robots-start-work-at-seven-hospitals/\">RP Vita medical telepresence robot</a> will guide the five foot five inch, 100 pound Ava 500. Meanwhile, a Cisco TelePresence EX60 personal video endpoint will broadcast a worker’s face and voice from its 21.5″ screen and send back sounds and images via an onboard camera and microphone.</p>
<p>Using a special app on a tablet, remote workers will wake the robot up and tell it where to go. The Ava 500 can map and autonomously navigate the halls of its home office, freeing the telecommuter to make small talk along the way (or leave the screen off until it reaches its destination). After a meeting, the unit dutifully returns to its charging station to catch a few winks and juice up for its next appointment.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/hVviDvsBQ78\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>iRobot CEO, Colin Angle, told the <em>Boston Herald</em> the Ava 500 gives folks the chance to be in the same room as the people they’re meeting, to see facial expressions, and to go in the hall after for a private chat. Angie Mistretta, director of telepresence solutions at Cisco, says, “The real value of the robot is that spontaneity.”</p>
<p>The question is whether that spontaneity is worth the robot’s <a href=\"http://bostonherald.com/business/technology/technology_news/2013/06/irobot_to_unveil_virtual_business_partner\">$70,000 price tag</a> (or $2,000 – $2,500 a month to rent). iRobot and Cisco are targeting executives, corporate trainers, site inspectors, and remote employees. Travel costs for these folks can stack up fast. If Ava 500 saves even a few trips a month, the robot could pay its way.</p>
<p>But businesses are cost cutting machines. If telepresence robots are attractive at $70,000, then they’re even more appealing at $7,000, and exponentially sexier as the price tag approaches $0. And already, firms can order a simpler telepresence robot from <a href=\"http://www.doublerobotics.com/\">Double Robotics</a> for $2,599. Businesses may be willing to sacrifice a little screen real estate and autonomous navigation for $67,000 in saved costs.</p>

<p>And they may not need to make that sacrifice very long. Advanced AI and robotics are entering the consumer market at drastically reduced prices.</p>
<p>We <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/11/ai-startup-anki-debuts-at-wwdc-wows-with-impressive-tech-50-million-in-funding/\">recently wrote</a> about AI startup Anki. Anki’s robot cars drive themselves around a track at top speed, avoiding each other, the wall, making evasive maneuvers—all this runs on iOS with an expected cost of $200. But Anki isn’t just about toy cars. It’s an iOS-powered consumer AI and robotics platform.</p>
<p>Such technology will just as easily guide an autonomous telepresence robot through the office. And soon. Offering enterprise solutions at enterprise prices in a world where AI and robotics are hitting consumer markets at consumer prices—how long will such products make sense?</p>

At the beginning of June, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/video/singularity-university-bloomberg-brink-06-04-llZ8NpBqQB65izwV_sjNeQ.html\">Singularity University was profiled on <em>Bloomberg Brink</em></a>, an original TV series that aims to explore “the revolutionaries, dreamers and disrupters re-shaping the future of entire industries.”</p>
<p>It’s 22 minutes of awesomeness about what small teams of passionate people are able to accomplish that is bound to inspire.</p>
<p>Bloomberg technology reporter Rachel Crane was on-site at SU’s Silicon Valley campus to speak with co-founders Ray Kurzweil and Peter Diamandis, CEO Rob Nail, and representatives of SU Labs startups about the impact and opportunities resulting from technology advancing at an exponential rate. Described as a place “where the world’s brightest minds convene to attack the world’s toughest challenges,” the program gives an incredible insider view of the amazing technologies emerging through Singularity University. Efforts such as the development of zero-gravity 3D printing from Made in Space and tricorder-like body scanning from Scanadu hold great promise for what exponential growth and technological progress will mean for everyone.</p>
