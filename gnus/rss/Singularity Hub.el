<p>First things first, fear not, <a href=\"http://www.realeyesit.com/homepage.aspx\">Realeyes</a> isn’t secretly sitting behind your webcam as you read this article. The service is more of an online marketing focus group. Volunteers are paid to review advertisements and give feedback. Unlike a traditional focus group, however, Realeyes volunteers can participate from home with no more than a laptop and webcam.</p>
<p>Realeyes records volunteer reactions to ads and sends the data back to the firm for processing. The software recognizes general expressions like happiness, fear, anger, disgust, sadness, and surprise.</p>
<p>Clients can poll populations up to seven million (though most will opt for much smaller groups) and get their data back in less than two days at a fraction of the price of other alternatives. Once complete, the data forms an emotional timeline for the advertisement’s duration and can be sliced and diced however the client wishes.</p>

<p>But how accurate is it? Judging by the Realeyes video, the tech works best on exaggerated facial expressions. Yet our expressions are complex and numerous. And only a handful of advertisements elicit overt reactions.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that what Realeyes has done isn’t interesting. But it isn’t true emotion recognition just yet. Teaching a computer to interpret facial expressions reminds us of the challenge of writing a program to convert speech to text.</p>
<p>Many expressions are the equivalent of homophones in spoken language. They require context and subtle cues to distinguish one from the other. Was that an amused half smile or a dismissive smirk?</p>
<p>It may be that until the technology advances a bit, market research firms will pursue a mix of face and emotion detection trials and traditional focus groups. Or maybe wider use shows subtle expression doesn’t matter. If the sample size is big enough, maybe only rudimentary capability is necessary to yield usable results.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/16/cara-face-recognition-transforms-standard-webcams-into-intelligent-sensors/\">another piece</a> of face detection software, Cara, by <a href=\"https://imrsv.com/\">IMRSV</a> only collects general demographic data (age bracket and sex) and what kind of attention folks are giving the ad (glances, look backs, full attention, etc.). Whereas Realeyes is a futuristic focus group, Cara is trying to measure a real world space—an ad in a window or endcap in a store—and can be downloaded by virtually anyone.</p>
<p>In either case, advertising firms have at their fingertips a giant new source of data, and you can expect they’ll use it one way or another. That demand may drive face and emotion detection to become more advanced and pervasive in the next few years.</p>

<p>A year and a half ago virtual reality was an elusive technodream. Maybe it still is. But since the middle of 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/\">Oculus Rift</a>, VR’s  latest <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/31/oculus-rift-is-breathing-new-life-into-the-dream-of-virtual-reality/\">great hope</a>, is winning over developers and newbies alike, accruing accolades, awards—and now cold cash.</p>
<p>After a successful Kickstarter and this year’s delivery of Rift headsets to developers, Oculus recently <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/vr-gets-vc/\">secured $16 million</a> in Series A funding to keep the wheels turning. Four venture capital firms (Spark Capital, Matrix Partners, Founders Fund, and Formation 8) contributed funds to take Oculus mainstream.</p>
<p>Gaming’s biggest names just released their “next generation” systems, and there are all kinds of neat additions. But they’re still building on the old model. Oculus, meanwhile, offers a fundamentally different experience.</p>
<p>When the Rift, an immersive virtual reality headset, first hit the tech community, it was but a bootstrapped pair of ski goggles with a screen hacked together in a garage. Rudimentary or no, the system impressed game developer royalty, avid gamers, and journalists alike.</p>
<p>The firm directed all that excitement into a $2.4 million Kickstarter and funded a manufacturing run for developers. Less obvious, but no less important, the Kickstarter is bringing a round of testing and feedback from professional game developers, a growing roster of VR-tailored games, and perhaps most valuable, credibility in the developer community.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-143_2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64141\" alt=\"SH 143_#2\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-143_2.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"318\" /></a></p>
<p>In roughly eighteen months, Oculus has blossomed from a guy in a garage to a <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/company/people/\">24-person team</a> of top gaming talent that’s manufactured and shipped their first devices. But it doesn’t end there. The final audience isn’t only the tech savviest. Quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Oculus is questing for a glitch-free, user friendly, immersive virtual reality experience for all of us. But to do that, they need investors. Which is why it’s a good thing they’ve got a story that virtually sells itself, a proven piece of hardware, a growing store of crowdsourced software, and a manufacturing run in their pocket.</p>
<p>Oculus raised $16 million in their initial round, and one imagines, if needed, there’s more where that came from. On the <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/vr-gets-vc/\">company blog</a>, Oculus founder, Palmer Luckey, wrote that the cash infusion should open doors for the firm.</p>
<p>“[This funding] helps us hire the best and brightest minds in VR from around the world. It lets us experiment and prototype with more cutting-edge tech. And it allows us to build a badass, consumer VR gaming platform, the likes of which the world has never seen.”</p>
<p>If all goes to plan (and as always, that’s a big if), it’s the kind of story you might expect in a Peter Diamandis keynote in the not too distant future. The Rift is an excellent example of how much the little guy can do (and how fast) in our exponential economy.</p>
<p>So, how long will it be before you or I can purchase a Rift of our very own? Oculus still isn’t saying. But they continue tinkering and testing behind the scenes.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSboqL82fmw\">The company brought</a> a 1080p “HD VR” Rift headset with them to E3. Though the pixels aren’t entirely undetectable, the higher def screen made them less obvious. Remember, 1080p is great from eight feet away, but the Rift display is only inches from your eyes.</p>
<p>The team is also reportedly still working on positional tracking (not just head tracking) for the consumer version. Nate Mitchell, VP of product, told <em>Tested</em>, “We’re not talking a wide, huge Kinect-type thing. But something that let’s you lean down and examine things in the game world.”</p>
<p>In the end, the not-so-quantifiable due date may be whenever Oculus gets the experience just right. There’s less room for error when you’re aiming a brand new piece of hardware at folks on their sofas. Not none, but less.</p>
<p>To really catch fire, a new product like the Rift ought to deliver an experience akin to tasting a deliciously unexpected combination of flavors at a fine restaurant. The moment forces you to close your eyes and savor. With the Rift, however, you might want to keep your eyes open and opt for a big grin instead.</p>

<p>Monsanto, the world’s largest seed company, recently reported the finding of unapproved genetically modified wheat in an Oregon field—and nobody knows where it came from. This is of concern, especially to farmers, but raises a larger question too. If genetic modification is the future, how will we control our creations?</p>
<p>The wheat at the center of this mystery was genetically modified to resist Monsanto’s herbicide, Roundup. The Oregon farmer discovered the plants growing in a fallow field and <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2013/05/finding_genetically_modified_w.html\">tried to kill</a> them with the widely-used herbicide. When they survived, he sent samples to Oregon State University where tests revealed it had been genetically modified to contain a Roundup resistant CP4/maize EPSPS gene. The USDA later confirmed these <a href=\"http://www.aphis.usda.gov/newsroom/2013/05/ge_wheat_detection.shtml\">findings</a>.</p>
<p>Although Monsanto got FDA approval for the wheat in food, they withdrew their EPA application in 2004, due to farmers worried about the potential loss of markets in Europe and Asia. The firm ended field trials and never marketed the product.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64027 alignright\" alt=\"Monsanto_#4\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_4.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Since the wheat was found and tested, Monsanto has been on the offensive to control what’s fast became a public relations mess.</p>
<p>Chief technology officer, Robb Fraley, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-05/monsanto-says-rogue-wheat-didn-t-contaminate-oregon-seed.html\">noted to the press</a> that the unapproved plants were found growing on less than one percent of the farmer’s 125-acre field, and Monsanto’s subsequent tests showed no sign of cross-contamination.</p>
<p>“It seems likely to be a random, isolated occurrence more consistent with the accidental or purposeful mixing of a small amount of seed during the planting, harvesting or during the fallow cycle in an individual field.”</p>
<p>The firm <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-05/monsanto-says-rogue-wheat-didn-t-contaminate-oregon-seed.html\">stopped planting</a> Roundup Ready wheat in Oregon over 12 years ago, the seeds are only viable for two years in the soil, and this is the first incident since trials ended in 2005. Monsanto isn’t implicating the farmer, but they aren’t ruling out a deliberate act of sabotage by someone else.</p>
<p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130621/us-genetically-modified-wheat/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics\">have postponed</a> imports of US white wheat from the region while they continue to study information from US officials. Meanwhile, citing economic damages, Monsanto <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-07/monsanto-sued-on-behalf-of-farmers-over-modified-wheat.html\">has been sued</a> by an environmental group and Washington farm and another group in Kansas.</p>
<p>Heading up the Washington lawsuit, the Center for Food Safety <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-07/monsanto-sued-on-behalf-of-farmers-over-modified-wheat.html\">stated</a>, “Because scheduled shipments already have been postponed and canceled, the presence of genetically engineered wheat has detrimentally impacted the domestic and global wheat markets and damaged plaintiffs and other wheat farmers.”</p>

<p>There are benefits to genetically modified crops. These include resistance to herbicides, diseases, and pests, better yield, increased shelf-life, and the potential for biofuel production. But opponents question whether genetically modified crops are safe, environmentally friendly, and whether genetically modified crops are really needed to address the world’s food needs.</p>
<p>Although, in this case, it appears the wheat did not spread, it can be difficult to predict the impact genetically modified organisms will have once released into the world at large.</p>
<p>It’s generally in Monsanto’s interest to avoid such errors. But clearly they are not immune. And perhaps a worse outcome is when the Monsantos of the world lose control of their product, inadvertently or via sabotage, as appears happened in this case.</p>
<p>With rapid advancement of knowledge and expertise in biotechnology, there’s great potential to do good. However, incidents like this underline the fact that no good thing is risk-free. As genetic modification continues, expect more such controversies—and hopefully, in their wake, better safeguards.</p>

<p>The name of China’s newest supercomputer, Tianhe-2, translates to MilkyWay-2. It’s a fitting moniker, maybe even a modest one. There are an estimated 300 billion stars in our galaxy. Tianhe-2 can run 100,000 times as many calculations <i>per second</i> as there are stars in the sky. Tianhe-2 is now <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">the fastest computer</a> on Earth, doubling the speed of its American rival, Titan—and it arrived two years ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>How did Tianhe-2 knock out Titan? Put simply, it’s a brute. Tianhe-2 uses six times as many cores (3.1 million) and twice the power (17.8 MW) as Titan to achieve double the speed (33.86 petaflop/s).</p>
<p>No single machine has held the top spot for more than one cycle since Japan’s K computer in 2011, and China hasn’t had the leading computer since Tianhe-2′s predecessor, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/11/07/china-owns-the-fastest-supercomputer-now-what-video/\">Tianhe-1a</a>. When completed, Tianhe-2’s theoretical peak performance will be 54.9 petaflop/s. That mark may stand for a little while. The US, at least, has no plans to build another supercomputer <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/159465-chinas-tianhe-2-supercomputer-twice-as-fast-as-does-titan-shocks-the-world-by-arriving-two-years-early\">until 2015</a>.</p>

<p>China is now a recognized supercomputing power. The country boasts <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">66 machines</a> on the Top500, over twice Japan’s 30 and a total second only to the US. Top500 editor, Jack Dongarra, who toured the Tianhe-2 facility and <a href=\"http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/tianhe-2-dongarra-report.pdf\">wrote a paper</a> on the supercomputer earlier this year, says it’s notable that, apart from its processors and coprocessors, Tianhe-2 is entirely of Chinese make.</p>
<p>“Most of the features of the system were developed in China, and they are only using Intel for the main compute part. That is, the interconnect, operating system, front-end processors and software are mainly Chinese.”</p>
<p>Even as China’s star is on the rise, the US remains undisputed hegemon. The US is home to <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">252 supercomputers</a>, or 50% of the Top500 list, and American companies IBM, Cray, Nvidia, and Intel still provide the hardware and know-how behind most of the world’s fastest machines.</p>
<p>Tianhe-2 and Titan are at the bleeding edge of supercomputing, but <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">total power</a> is growing fast too. Whereas there was only one supercomputer processing petaflop/s in 2008, there now are 26 such systems, up from 23 last November. And the list’s combined computing power is 223 petaflop/s, up from 123 petaflop/s a year ago.</p>
<p>If supercomputers continue along their current trajectory, sometime around 2018—maybe a little later—the world’s fastest computer will breach the exaflop/s barrier. That’s five times faster than the entire June 2013 list <i>combined.</i></p>

<p>What will we do with all that speed?</p>
<p>The <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/26/quest-to-model-the-human-brain-nets-a-billion-euros/\">Human Brain Project</a>, recently funded to the tune of a billion euros, plans to use exascale computing to build a complete digital model of the brain. The <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/12/03/australian-outback-launches-fastest-radio-telescope-in-the-world/\">Square Kilometer Array</a> radio telescope will use an exascale computer to link a 3,000 kilometer array, 50 times as sensitive and 10,000 times faster than any telescope in existence today.</p>
<p>All that says nothing of ordinary desktop, laptop, or (more likely) mobile computing. If today’s personal devices are speedier than a supercomputer from a couple decades ago, perhaps we’ll carry petaflop/s power in our pocket, glasses, or contact lenses twenty years from now.</p>
<p>Jason Silva says modern telescopes “extend the optic nerve of humanity.” But our brains are the more powerful organ, sitting behind the optic nerve and interpreting its input. Modern supercomputers are the brain’s James Webb. They extend, expand, accelerate, and augment our mental powers—the universe’s greatest trick yet.</p>

<p>Andrew Johnson, or Cyber-AJ, is one of  <a href=\"http://www.pdf.org/en/parkinson_statistics\">10 million people</a> suffering from Parkinson’s Disease (PD) worldwide. The disease is progressive, and it is devastating.</p>
<p>Diagnosed four years ago, Johnson recently described himself as a “39 year old trapped in an 89-year-old body.” But earlier this year, his life was transformed by a technique increasingly prescribed to a subset of PD patients called deep brain stimulation (DBS).</p>
<p>In February, Johnson underwent the second of two surgeries to implant a neurostimulator in his brain. The neurostimulator is about the <a href=\"http://www.parkinson.org/Parkinson-s-Disease/Treatment/Surgical-Treatment-Options/Deep-Brain-Stimulation\">size of a stopwatch</a>, is internally wired to a pacemaker in his chest, and once switched on by a handheld remote, the device’s electrical current jams the misbehaving neurons responsible for PD’s physical symptoms.</p>
<p>Since the surgery, Johnson’s life has been better. A lot better. In a recent video posted on his blog, <a href=\"http://youngandshaky.com/\">youngandshaky.com</a>, Johnson demonstrates the power of his new device by running an experiment on camera—he turns off the juice.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/uBh2LxTW0s0\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>It’s really a remarkable video. Johnson struggles to speak and is on the verge of dropping the remote when he switches the current back on. Almost instantaneously, his tremors subside. It’s difficult not to share that deepest of deep breaths he draws into his lungs. Discomfort eased, his relief is palpable.</p>
<p>But the surgery was no walk in the park. Afterward, Johnson says he was in “obscene amounts of pain” where the “slightest whisper was like a dagger to the skull.”</p>
<p>After a few days, his medical team began adjusting the device and dialing in the optimal level of current. A strange sensation, he says, but pleasurable, as his body came “alive again after being cased in concrete for so long.”</p>
<p>For patients like Johnson, DBS can deliver dramatic results, but it <a href=\"http://www.parkinson.org/NationalParkinsonFoundation/files/0d/0dc56c7a-01b9-4533-80f5-9963901a2bb4.pdf\">isn’t appropriate</a> for everyone, nor is the surgery <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/23/deep-brain-stimulation-used-to-treat-early-stage-parkinsons-disease/\">risk-free</a>.</p>
<p>As Johnson warns on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/06/25/195521917/the-man-with-a-battery-operated-brain?ft=1&f=1007\">his blog</a>, “This is not a miracle cure, it is a proven treatment which happened to work for me quite spectacularly, but that was because a subset of my symptoms were ones most likely to respond to the surgery.”</p>
<p>Those wondering whether DBS might work for them should consult their doctor. But when diagnosed and targeted accurately, in combination with medication, DBS can radically reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients and their families.</p>
<p>Even with an as yet incomplete understanding of what goes on between our ears, modern neuroscience is delivering life-changing improvements for some patients.</p>
<p>As research continues, such treatments may become more commonly prescribed and increasingly effective. Cyber-AJ and his “battery operated brain” exemplify the inspiring combination of man, machine, and modern science.</p>

<p>Most of us know when we’re stressed. Physical cues like stomach butterflies, a flushed face, or muscle tension are hard to miss. Problem is, said symptoms can be very difficult to control. Once going—these things tend to snowball.</p>
<p>The <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/484175508/the-pip-a-biosensor-that-helps-you-relax-through-p?ref=category\">PIP biosensor Kickstarter</a> aims to help folks mediate stress by objectively measuring symptoms, digitally visualizing the results, and then gamifying stress reduction. It’s the latest in an avalanche of sensors aiming to increase body awareness and health.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Aio2JTpM29E\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>How does it work? The PIP measures Galvanic Skin Response—or changes in the skin’s conductivity as a stressful situation sends the heart racing and activates the sweat glands. The biosensor, held between thumb and forefinger, relays this information by bluetooth to a mobile device (Android or iOS) where an app interprets and displays it.</p>
<p>Folks interact with one of three games designed to develop biofeedback and thereby gain “conscious control over an aspect of their psycho-physiological state.” By gamifying the experience, people are motivated to play repeatedly, figure out what works, what doesn’t, and improve along the way.</p>
<p>The various pledge levels include the PIP device, games, and for top tier contributors, a trip to Ireland (no flight but two nights in a posh Dublin hotel) to meet the team, brainstorm the PIP’s future, and celebrate over a few pints at the pub. If the $100,000 goal is funded, the team hopes to deliver the devices by February, 2014.</p>
<p>It’s a cool idea, but the PIP isn’t entirely novel. Meditation is that other self-awareness “game” that’s been played for a few millennia. Thing is, meditation isn’t for everyone and can be challenging to master. Maybe by way of a few modern tricks, PIP proves the ideal gateway device to a more enlightened populace, or at the very least, a more relaxed one.</p>

You are here to change the world.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dugan is referring to Singularity University’s Graduate Studies Program (GSP) which kicked off last week in Mountain View California. The GSP gathers 80 talented students, this year from 33 countries, for the purpose of creating start up companies that will positively impact the lives of 1 billion people within ten years. Previous GSP participants have <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/companies/\">started dozens of companies that are now making an impact as part of Singularity Labs</a>, and more are sure to come out of this year’s class.  Over the course of the next ten weeks, students will hear over 500 hours of lectures from nobel prize winners, CEO’s, serial entrepreneurs, government leaders, and leading edge researchers.</p>
<p>If you are a <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/membership-signup/\">Singularity Hub member</a> you will be able to see a video of the entire opening ceremony in our <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/video-central/\">video central</a> soon.  Here is a small peak at the opening ceremony:</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/93Ex79Pzv9Q\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Now in its 5th year, each GSP begins with a “Global Grand Challenge Week,” an introductory seminar to introduce a range of problem areas including poverty, global health, education, security, environmental issues, water, and energy. Next, students spend several weeks learning across several exponential technologies seeing massive improvements in price in performance; areas like biotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, 3D printing, medicine, and computing. The goal is to leverage these technologies in a favorable way and create companies that change the world for the better.</p>
<p>“Today a guy or a gal in a garage with access to one of these exponential technologies can touch the lives of billions on our planet,” pointed out Singularity University co-founder Peter Diamandis. “We have a moral obligation to create a world of opportunity for everyone on earth.”</p>
<p>Dr. Ray Kurzweil, co-founder and chancellor of Singularity University, was on hand to share his unique perspectives on exponential growth as well. Kurzweil has built a sterling reputation for precision accuracy in futures forecasting and technology predictions. “The world of information technology moves exponentially, and this gives me great reason for optimism,” said Kurzweil. “The world today looks nothing like it did 40 years ago and the world in 10 years will look nothing like it looks today. You all have an opportunity to create that world.”</p>
<p>“You all are doer dreamers, and I love doer dreamers,” Dr Dugan said in her closing remarks. Dr. Dugan’s final words, greeted with a standing ovation and booming applause capture the essence of the evening and offer appropriate guidance to this summer’s Graduate Studies Class. “The world has enough doers who aren’t able to dream and dreamers who are afraid to build. You all have chosen to build. Now go out and build some epic shit!”</p>

<p>Remember watching Boston Dynamics’ <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/09/10/boston-dynamics-robot-cheetah-outruns-swiftest-human/\">Cheetah robot</a> outrun Usain Bolt? Meet its little cousin, <a href=\"http://biorob.epfl.ch/cheetah\">Cheetah-cub</a>, built by EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory (Biorob). Being just a cub, it’s no Usain Bolt, but Biorob believes it’s the fastest robot of its kind.</p>
<p>Cheetah-cub is about 21 centimeters long and weighs a kilogram—roughly the same size as its namesake or, less provocatively, a common house cat. Its top speed is about 3.2 miles per hour, or seven body lengths a second.</p>
<p>Unlike the Boston Dynamics cheetah robot, Cheetah-cub more closely mimics the real thing with its spring-loaded, three-segment legs (also called “pantograph” legs).</p>
<p>Biorob attributes Cheetah-cub’s self-stabilizing gait—even at top speed—to its biomimetic leg segmentation and stride pattern. In contrast, the Boston Dynamics bot goes fast but is fairly stiff and still requires a stabilizing boom to keep it centered.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/UWlzMIl7E48\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Cheetah-cub builds on another Biorob creation, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/27/amphibious-salamander-like-robot-swims-in-water-crawls-on-land/\">Amphibot</a>, by employing central pattern generators. CPGs are specially engineered, neuron-inspired circuits capable of producing complex leg movements from simple commands from the robot’s “brain.”</p>
<p>All this is electrically controlled by an external power source, requiring a power cable.</p>
<p>Like many quadrupedal robots, Biorob says future applications may include sending these robots where other machines on wheels or tracks can’t go—for example, rough terrain on emergency or reconnaissance missions. At a trot, the robot can successfully navigate steps up to 20% of its leg length.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-wcSdiQWfUA\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>The EPFL team built the robot using mostly off-the-shelf parts, as opposed to expensive custom components. Cheetah-cub is cheap, tough, and easily assembled which, added to its other attributes, makes it a useful research design.</p>
<p>Most of all, it’s fun to watch these guys trundle around and imagine that, no matter how advanced they are now, no matter how crucial a stepping stone this research is—they’ll probably look comically awkward in a decade.</p>

<p>It’s no secret Google’s building a high-tech portfolio beyond search, from self-driving cars to artificial intelligence. But they’re also quietly building something else entirely—a futuristic new campus at NASA Moffett Field.

<p>Over the years, the Googleplex has been well adapted to house the titan of search, but it is not a Google creation from the ground up. Said another way, that particular algorithm has not yet been optimized. So, the firm decided to undertake a building project more suitably ambitious and principled—a building of the future synthesizing the most cutting edge technology of the present.</p>
<p>Cheryl Barton, founder and creative director of SF green landscape design firm <a href=\"http://www.toocb.com/\">O|CB</a>, said, “We’re raising the bar for corporate campuses. If you’re thinking forward a hundred years, you’ve got to be a gamechanger.”</p>
<p>Like Google’s other offices, the Bay View campus will be stocked with cafes, food, and fun. But when you’re building something from the ground up, you get to arrange the structures any way you like. The buildings on the new campus are jointed, bending them around each other and central open spaces.</p>
<p>The configuration places every employee about three minutes from every other employee and encourages serendipitous interaction. If workers feel like getting somewhere more quickly, there’ll be an elevated infinity loop bike track connecting the buildings. Google’s director of campus development, John Igoe, said the goal is to create a “frictionless environment” that allows folks to focus on work.</p>
<p>Central to that vision is interior and exterior design. Indoor workspaces will be open and naturally lit whenever possible—the lighting will be dimmed or off 77% of the year. There will be no recirculated air inside. And indoor spaces will use radiant heating and cooling transmitted via a network of water pipes and warmed in part by waste heat from the buildings’ refrigeration systems.</p>
<p>All this will be powered by large scale solar (presumably not exclusively) and aims to be 46% more energy efficient than the San Francisco Bay Area average.</p>
<p>That’s the interior. What about outside?</p>
<p>Google wants the Bay View campus to work in harmony with its natural surroundings. The 2.5 acre footprint comprises only 6% of the total 42 acre site. And though the central buildings offer 1.1 million square feet of indoor office space, architectural design firm <a href=\"http://www.nbbj.com/\">NBBJ</a> added five “outdoor rooms.”</p>
<p>The design of these rooms was driven by data, a detailed study of how heat and wind flow through the area and how shade and sunlight change throughout the year.</p>
<p>The piazza will be a thriving center of activity with coffee and food trucks. The university-inspired quad will be a place to eat lunch, mingle, or host events. The garden and overlook are contemplative, landscaped outdoor rooms overlooking the bay—open places to inspire innovation or seek a moment’s silence for its own sake.</p>
<p>The wildest of these “rooms” will be an area of regenerated freshwater wetlands. Barton said a big part of the project was “taking the pulse of the site.” According to NBBJ’s Ryan Mullenix, 1/3 of the bay had been filled in by 1960 and 90% of the naturally occurring wetlands destroyed. There’s no going back, but the firm can reverse the hands of time somewhat by reintroducing wetlands onsite.</p>
<p>And in fact, these wetlands will fulfill multiple purposes, creating a positive employee experience, improving the site, and providing sustainable, green water management. Josiah Cain of <a href=\"http://www.sherwoodengineers.com/projects_streetscape.html\">Sherwood Design Engineers</a> said that together with a series of green roofs and green walls, the wetlands will also act as a natural filter for stormwater and wastewater.</p>
<p>The Q&A was short, but one local worker questioned Google’s traffic and parking plans. As many as 4,000 Google employees may descend on Moffett Field, paired with only around 2,200 parking spaces. And although they plan to widen a central access road to the complex, those already working in the area wonder whether it will be enough.</p>
<p>Igoe’s answer? Google doesn’t think the current passenger car paradigm will last. He said the firm wants 50% of its workforce to arrive by bus or bike. (Anyone who’s lived in San Francisco for any period knows well the fleet of Google buses invading the city during commuting hours.) In particular, they’d like to up the bike-to-work folks from 5% to 20%, although he didn’t elaborate on how they’ll arrive at that number.</p>
<p>It’s a big project and a costly one to boot. But Igoe wouldn’t say how much exactly—just that they took the original cost of the Googleplex, added inflation and a Google factor (for cutting-edge tech), and arrived at a competitive cost.</p>
<p>Let’s just say, not cheap but possibly very cool. And as the years pass, those tech-induced efficiency gains will likely help defray steep up-front costs.</p>

Hill" "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 16:14:31 +0000" "<p>Sometimes it’s the simplest of explanations that can change your whole perspective…at least, that’s what statistics guru Hans Rosling hopes to achieve in a new video.</p>
<p>Rosling, who is a professor of global health at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and frequent TED speaker, has been pushing data analysis at audiences for years using stunning visuals and impassioned presentations in an effort to disrupt popular yet erroneous mindsets of global issues. In 2010, he stated, “I kid you not, statistics are now the sexiest subject on the planet,” backing that statement up <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/12/09/hans-rosling-shows-you-200-years-of-global-growth-in-4-minutes-video/\">with an awesome augmented-reality fueled video for <em>The Joy of Stats</em> BBC documentary</a>.</p>
<p>The new video from Rosling, however, aims to distill the grand challenges facing the world in as straightforward and low tech approach as possible – with LEGOs. Check out the video, courtesy of <em>The Guardian</em>:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SxbprYyjyyU?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Rosling’s message is that population growth can only be managed by both improving the living standards of the poorest in the world and persuading the wealthiest to embrace better resource distribution. In other words, somehow the increasing trend toward socioeconomic divergence must be reversed — easier said than done.</p>
<p>Perhaps Rosling will be able to release more videos in the future with proposals to these global grand challenges using LEGOs, but next time, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/04/12/six-of-the-best-robot-videos-of-lego-mindstorms-nxt/\">he just might have to use <em>Mindstorms</em></a>.</p>

<p>From <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/21/space-exploration-on-the-cheap-kickstarter-sensation-ardusat-by-nanosatisfi-launches-in-2013/\">Ardusat</a> to <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/29/diamandis-and-planetary-resources-to-build-first-crowdfunded-public-space-telescope/\">ARKYD</a>, space startups are bringing space exploration and participation down to Earth. How? Thanks to years of microchip and sensor miniaturization, we are now making useful satellites shockingly tiny, powerful, and affordable. And recently, one design in particular, the CubeSat, has become near-ubiquitous in the race to throw open the door to space exploration.</p>
<p>According to the Space Review, as many CubeSats as have been launched in their history (<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/09/picosatellites\">50 or so</a>) are planned for launch this year (<a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2155/1\">50 to 70</a>). These days, launching a CubeSat falls within most university research budgets. And indeed, universities make up the majority of launches, though well-heeled or Kickstarter-funded students, hobbyists, and artists aren’t priced out of the equation either.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_54777\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SH-11_MiniSats-Media-22.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54777\" title=\"SH 11_MiniSats (Media) #2\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SH-11_MiniSats-Media-22.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (SSOD) used to release CubeSats from the International Space Station.

<p>The base CubeSat is 10 centimeters to a side and, depending on what you put in it, weighs up to a kilogram. CubeSats are designed to be scalable along one axis. A 2U satellite is 20 centimeters long, 3U is 30 centimeters long, and so forth.</p>
<p>Anyone can put a small satellite into orbit if they can figure out how to engineer it and pay for the ride. The only regulatory requirement in the US is a <a href=\"http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/CRSRA/generalFAQ.html\">NOAA license</a> for satellites that “sense” the Earth’s surface by way of “emitted, reflected, or diffracted” electromagnetic waves (think high powered cameras, radar, etc.).</p>
<p>Because CubeSats are a standard size and weight, they are compatible with <a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2155/1\">standard deployment systems</a> like the Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD). P-PODs accommodate three CubeSats and can be attached to rockets as secondary payloads, making it easier than ever to hitch a ride into orbit.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/50_AntgK8ZA\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Most of today’s CubeSats ride on other commercial or government rockets at a steep per pound launch cost. But as private rocket developers like <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/\">SpaceX</a> make cheaper rockets, we’re likely to see more affordable launches in the future. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, due to launch later this year, may <a href=\"http://www.nss.org/articles/falconheavy.html\">slash launch costs</a> to under $1,000/lb.</p>
<p>Building and programming decently powerful satellites is getting cheaper and easier too. Some CubeSats even <a href=\"http://www.sstl.co.uk/divisions/earth-observation-science/science-missions/strand-nanosatellite\">boast Android phones</a> for brains. Why build hardware from scratch when smartphones contain miniature “sensors, cameras, GPS, batteries, accelerometers, compasses, [and] data storage”?</p>
<p>Or even better, if you backed the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space\">ArduSat Kickstarter</a> last year, $150 bought you a timeslot to steer their CubeSat and take 15 pictures from orbit. Or $325 booked satellite time to upload and run an experiment, application, or game using the satellite’s CPU and suite of sensors. (We visited ArduSat creator Nanosatisfi’s San Francisco workshop late last year. See <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/21/space-exploration-on-the-cheap-kickstarter-sensation-ardusat-by-nanosatisfi-launches-in-2013/\">here</a> for more.)</p>
<p>What other creative uses are folks finding for CubeSats?</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.interorbital.com/\">Interorbital Systems</a>, a space exploration company that specializes in small satellites, offers a <a href=\"http://interorbital.com/interorbital_062313_002.htm\">list of applications</a> including imaging, research, space art, and space burials. The Japanese FITSAT-1 has been <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/japanese-satellite-fitsat-1-morse-code-space_n_2615110.html\">flashing morse code</a> from orbit since late last year. Project Calliope <a href=\"http://projectcalliope.com/\">will convert</a> the ionosphere into free sound files for all to hear and perhaps mix and remix into music.</p>
<p>Maybe these seem a bit frivolous. But the fact there’s even room for frivolity is hugely promising. The more small satellites we can engineer and launch, the better and faster we can hone our designs. As space research moves beyond the elite few, the pace of space technology will accelerate. It’s about time, don’t you think?</p>

<p>A year and a half ago virtual reality was an elusive technodream. Maybe it still is. But since the middle of 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/\">Oculus Rift</a>, VR’s  latest <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/31/oculus-rift-is-breathing-new-life-into-the-dream-of-virtual-reality/\">great hope</a>, is winning over developers and newbies alike, accruing accolades, awards—and now cold cash.</p>
<p>After a successful Kickstarter and this year’s delivery of Rift headsets to developers, Oculus recently <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/vr-gets-vc/\">secured $16 million</a> in Series A funding to keep the wheels turning. Four venture capital firms (Spark Capital, Matrix Partners, Founders Fund, and Formation 8) contributed funds to take Oculus mainstream.</p>
<p>Gaming’s biggest names just released their “next generation” systems, and there are all kinds of neat additions. But they’re still building on the old model. Oculus, meanwhile, offers a fundamentally different experience.</p>
<p>When the Rift, an immersive virtual reality headset, first hit the tech community, it was but a bootstrapped pair of ski goggles with a screen hacked together in a garage. Rudimentary or no, the system impressed game developer royalty, avid gamers, and journalists alike.</p>
<p>The firm directed all that excitement into a $2.4 million Kickstarter and funded a manufacturing run for developers. Less obvious, but no less important, the Kickstarter is bringing a round of testing and feedback from professional game developers, a growing roster of VR-tailored games, and perhaps most valuable, credibility in the developer community.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-143_2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64141\" alt=\"SH 143_#2\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SH-143_2.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"318\" /></a></p>
<p>In roughly eighteen months, Oculus has blossomed from a guy in a garage to a <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/company/people/\">24-person team</a> of top gaming talent that’s manufactured and shipped their first devices. But it doesn’t end there. The final audience isn’t only the tech savviest. Quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Oculus is questing for a glitch-free, user friendly, immersive virtual reality experience for all of us. But to do that, they need investors. Which is why it’s a good thing they’ve got a story that virtually sells itself, a proven piece of hardware, a growing store of crowdsourced software, and a manufacturing run in their pocket.</p>
<p>Oculus raised $16 million in their initial round, and one imagines, if needed, there’s more where that came from. On the <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/vr-gets-vc/\">company blog</a>, Oculus founder, Palmer Luckey, wrote that the cash infusion should open doors for the firm.</p>
<p>“[This funding] helps us hire the best and brightest minds in VR from around the world. It lets us experiment and prototype with more cutting-edge tech. And it allows us to build a badass, consumer VR gaming platform, the likes of which the world has never seen.”</p>
<p>If all goes to plan (and as always, that’s a big if), it’s the kind of story you might expect in a Peter Diamandis keynote in the not too distant future. The Rift is an excellent example of how much the little guy can do (and how fast) in our exponential economy.</p>
<p>So, how long will it be before you or I can purchase a Rift of our very own? Oculus still isn’t saying. But they continue tinkering and testing behind the scenes.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSboqL82fmw\">The company brought</a> a 1080p “HD VR” Rift headset with them to E3. Though the pixels aren’t entirely undetectable, the higher def screen made them less obvious. Remember, 1080p is great from eight feet away, but the Rift display is only inches from your eyes.</p>
<p>The team is also reportedly still working on positional tracking (not just head tracking) for the consumer version. Nate Mitchell, VP of product, told <em>Tested</em>, “We’re not talking a wide, huge Kinect-type thing. But something that let’s you lean down and examine things in the game world.”</p>
<p>In the end, the not-so-quantifiable due date may be whenever Oculus gets the experience just right. There’s less room for error when you’re aiming a brand new piece of hardware at folks on their sofas. Not none, but less.</p>
<p>To really catch fire, a new product like the Rift ought to deliver an experience akin to tasting a deliciously unexpected combination of flavors at a fine restaurant. The moment forces you to close your eyes and savor. With the Rift, however, you might want to keep your eyes open and opt for a big grin instead.</p>

<p>Monsanto, the world’s largest seed company, recently reported the finding of unapproved genetically modified wheat in an Oregon field—and nobody knows where it came from. This is of concern, especially to farmers, but raises a larger question too. If genetic modification is the future, how will we control our creations?</p>
<p>The wheat at the center of this mystery was genetically modified to resist Monsanto’s herbicide, Roundup. The Oregon farmer discovered the plants growing in a fallow field and <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2013/05/finding_genetically_modified_w.html\">tried to kill</a> them with the widely-used herbicide. When they survived, he sent samples to Oregon State University where tests revealed it had been genetically modified to contain a Roundup resistant CP4/maize EPSPS gene. The USDA later confirmed these <a href=\"http://www.aphis.usda.gov/newsroom/2013/05/ge_wheat_detection.shtml\">findings</a>.</p>
<p>Although Monsanto got FDA approval for the wheat in food, they withdrew their EPA application in 2004, due to farmers worried about the potential loss of markets in Europe and Asia. The firm ended field trials and never marketed the product.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64027 alignright\" alt=\"Monsanto_#4\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_4.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Since the wheat was found and tested, Monsanto has been on the offensive to control what’s fast became a public relations mess.</p>
<p>Chief technology officer, Robb Fraley, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-05/monsanto-says-rogue-wheat-didn-t-contaminate-oregon-seed.html\">noted to the press</a> that the unapproved plants were found growing on less than one percent of the farmer’s 125-acre field, and Monsanto’s subsequent tests showed no sign of cross-contamination.</p>
<p>“It seems likely to be a random, isolated occurrence more consistent with the accidental or purposeful mixing of a small amount of seed during the planting, harvesting or during the fallow cycle in an individual field.”</p>
<p>The firm <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-05/monsanto-says-rogue-wheat-didn-t-contaminate-oregon-seed.html\">stopped planting</a> Roundup Ready wheat in Oregon over 12 years ago, the seeds are only viable for two years in the soil, and this is the first incident since trials ended in 2005. Monsanto isn’t implicating the farmer, but they aren’t ruling out a deliberate act of sabotage by someone else.</p>
<p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130621/us-genetically-modified-wheat/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics\">have postponed</a> imports of US white wheat from the region while they continue to study information from US officials. Meanwhile, citing economic damages, Monsanto <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-07/monsanto-sued-on-behalf-of-farmers-over-modified-wheat.html\">has been sued</a> by an environmental group and Washington farm and another group in Kansas.</p>
<p>Heading up the Washington lawsuit, the Center for Food Safety <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-07/monsanto-sued-on-behalf-of-farmers-over-modified-wheat.html\">stated</a>, “Because scheduled shipments already have been postponed and canceled, the presence of genetically engineered wheat has detrimentally impacted the domestic and global wheat markets and damaged plaintiffs and other wheat farmers.”</p>
<p><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64032 alignleft\" alt=\"Monsanto_#3\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Monsanto_3.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Whether Monsanto is to blame or they’re the victim—how we control genetically modified plants or other organisms is a futuristic debate beginning in the here and now.</p>
<p>There are benefits to genetically modified crops. These include resistance to herbicides, diseases, and pests, better yield, increased shelf-life, and the potential for biofuel production. But opponents question whether genetically modified crops are safe, environmentally friendly, and whether genetically modified crops are really needed to address the world’s food needs.</p>
<p>Although, in this case, it appears the wheat did not spread, it can be difficult to predict the impact genetically modified organisms will have once released into the world at large.</p>
<p>It’s generally in Monsanto’s interest to avoid such errors. But clearly they are not immune. And perhaps a worse outcome is when the Monsantos of the world lose control of their product, inadvertently or via sabotage, as appears happened in this case.</p>
<p>With rapid advancement of knowledge and expertise in biotechnology, there’s great potential to do good. However, incidents like this underline the fact that no good thing is risk-free. As genetic modification continues, expect more such controversies—and hopefully, in their wake, better safeguards.</p>

<p>From <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/21/space-exploration-on-the-cheap-kickstarter-sensation-ardusat-by-nanosatisfi-launches-in-2013/\">Ardusat</a> to <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/29/diamandis-and-planetary-resources-to-build-first-crowdfunded-public-space-telescope/\">ARKYD</a>, space startups are bringing space exploration and participation down to Earth. How? Thanks to years of microchip and sensor miniaturization, we are now making useful satellites shockingly tiny, powerful, and affordable. And recently, one design in particular, the CubeSat, has become near-ubiquitous in the race to throw open the door to space exploration.</p>
<p>According to the Space Review, as many CubeSats as have been launched in their history (<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/09/picosatellites\">50 or so</a>) are planned for launch this year (<a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2155/1\">50 to 70</a>). These days, launching a CubeSat falls within most university research budgets. And indeed, universities make up the majority of launches, though well-heeled or Kickstarter-funded students, hobbyists, and artists aren’t priced out of the equation either.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_54777\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SH-11_MiniSats-Media-22.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54777\" title=\"SH 11_MiniSats (Media) #2\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SH-11_MiniSats-Media-22.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (SSOD) used to release CubeSats from the International Space Station.

<p>The base CubeSat is 10 centimeters to a side and, depending on what you put in it, weighs up to a kilogram. CubeSats are designed to be scalable along one axis. A 2U satellite is 20 centimeters long, 3U is 30 centimeters long, and so forth.</p>
<p>Anyone can put a small satellite into orbit if they can figure out how to engineer it and pay for the ride. The only regulatory requirement in the US is a <a href=\"http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/CRSRA/generalFAQ.html\">NOAA license</a> for satellites that “sense” the Earth’s surface by way of “emitted, reflected, or diffracted” electromagnetic waves (think high powered cameras, radar, etc.).</p>
<p>Because CubeSats are a standard size and weight, they are compatible with <a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2155/1\">standard deployment systems</a> like the Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD). P-PODs accommodate three CubeSats and can be attached to rockets as secondary payloads, making it easier than ever to hitch a ride into orbit.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/50_AntgK8ZA\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Most of today’s CubeSats ride on other commercial or government rockets at a steep per pound launch cost. But as private rocket developers like <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/\">SpaceX</a> make cheaper rockets, we’re likely to see more affordable launches in the future. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, due to launch later this year, may <a href=\"http://www.nss.org/articles/falconheavy.html\">slash launch costs</a> to under $1,000/lb.</p>
<p>Building and programming decently powerful satellites is getting cheaper and easier too. Some CubeSats even <a href=\"http://www.sstl.co.uk/divisions/earth-observation-science/science-missions/strand-nanosatellite\">boast Android phones</a> for brains. Why build hardware from scratch when smartphones contain miniature “sensors, cameras, GPS, batteries, accelerometers, compasses, [and] data storage”?</p>
<p>Or even better, if you backed the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space\">ArduSat Kickstarter</a> last year, $150 bought you a timeslot to steer their CubeSat and take 15 pictures from orbit. Or $325 booked satellite time to upload and run an experiment, application, or game using the satellite’s CPU and suite of sensors. (We visited ArduSat creator Nanosatisfi’s San Francisco workshop late last year. See <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/21/space-exploration-on-the-cheap-kickstarter-sensation-ardusat-by-nanosatisfi-launches-in-2013/\">here</a> for more.)</p>
<p>What other creative uses are folks finding for CubeSats?</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.interorbital.com/\">Interorbital Systems</a>, a space exploration company that specializes in small satellites, offers a <a href=\"http://interorbital.com/interorbital_062313_002.htm\">list of applications</a> including imaging, research, space art, and space burials. The Japanese FITSAT-1 has been <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/japanese-satellite-fitsat-1-morse-code-space_n_2615110.html\">flashing morse code</a> from orbit since late last year. Project Calliope <a href=\"http://projectcalliope.com/\">will convert</a> the ionosphere into free sound files for all to hear and perhaps mix and remix into music.</p>
<p>Maybe these seem a bit frivolous. But the fact there’s even room for frivolity is hugely promising. The more small satellites we can engineer and launch, the better and faster we can hone our designs. As space research moves beyond the elite few, the pace of space technology will accelerate. It’s about time, don’t you think?</p>

<p>The name of China’s newest supercomputer, Tianhe-2, translates to MilkyWay-2. It’s a fitting moniker, maybe even a modest one. There are an estimated 300 billion stars in our galaxy. Tianhe-2 can run 100,000 times as many calculations <i>per second</i> as there are stars in the sky. Tianhe-2 is now <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">the fastest computer</a> on Earth, doubling the speed of its American rival, Titan—and it arrived two years ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>How did Tianhe-2 knock out Titan? Put simply, it’s a brute. Tianhe-2 uses six times as many cores (3.1 million) and twice the power (17.8 MW) as Titan to achieve double the speed (33.86 petaflop/s).</p>
<p>No single machine has held the top spot for more than one cycle since Japan’s K computer in 2011, and China hasn’t had the leading computer since Tianhe-2′s predecessor, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/11/07/china-owns-the-fastest-supercomputer-now-what-video/\">Tianhe-1a</a>. When completed, Tianhe-2’s theoretical peak performance will be 54.9 petaflop/s. That mark may stand for a little while. The US, at least, has no plans to build another supercomputer <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/159465-chinas-tianhe-2-supercomputer-twice-as-fast-as-does-titan-shocks-the-world-by-arriving-two-years-early\">until 2015</a>.</p>

<p>China is now a recognized supercomputing power. The country boasts <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">66 machines</a> on the Top500, over twice Japan’s 30 and a total second only to the US. Top500 editor, Jack Dongarra, who toured the Tianhe-2 facility and <a href=\"http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/tianhe-2-dongarra-report.pdf\">wrote a paper</a> on the supercomputer earlier this year, says it’s notable that, apart from its processors and coprocessors, Tianhe-2 is entirely of Chinese make.</p>
<p>“Most of the features of the system were developed in China, and they are only using Intel for the main compute part. That is, the interconnect, operating system, front-end processors and software are mainly Chinese.”</p>
<p>Even as China’s star is on the rise, the US remains undisputed hegemon. The US is home to <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">252 supercomputers</a>, or 50% of the Top500 list, and American companies IBM, Cray, Nvidia, and Intel still provide the hardware and know-how behind most of the world’s fastest machines.</p>
<p>Tianhe-2 and Titan are at the bleeding edge of supercomputing, but <a href=\"http://www.top500.org/blog/lists/2013/06/press-release/\">total power</a> is growing fast too. Whereas there was only one supercomputer processing petaflop/s in 2008, there now are 26 such systems, up from 23 last November. And the list’s combined computing power is 223 petaflop/s, up from 123 petaflop/s a year ago.</p>
<p>If supercomputers continue along their current trajectory, sometime around 2018—maybe a little later—the world’s fastest computer will breach the exaflop/s barrier. That’s five times faster than the entire June 2013 list <i>combined.</i></p>

<p>What will we do with all that speed?</p>
<p>The <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/26/quest-to-model-the-human-brain-nets-a-billion-euros/\">Human Brain Project</a>, recently funded to the tune of a billion euros, plans to use exascale computing to build a complete digital model of the brain. The <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/12/03/australian-outback-launches-fastest-radio-telescope-in-the-world/\">Square Kilometer Array</a> radio telescope will use an exascale computer to link a 3,000 kilometer array, 50 times as sensitive and 10,000 times faster than any telescope in existence today.</p>
<p>All that says nothing of ordinary desktop, laptop, or (more likely) mobile computing. If today’s personal devices are speedier than a supercomputer from a couple decades ago, perhaps we’ll carry petaflop/s power in our pocket, glasses, or contact lenses twenty years from now.</p>
<p>Jason Silva says modern telescopes “extend the optic nerve of humanity.” But our brains are the more powerful organ, sitting behind the optic nerve and interpreting its input. Modern supercomputers are the brain’s James Webb. They extend, expand, accelerate, and augment our mental powers—the universe’s greatest trick yet.</p>

<p>Andrew Johnson, or Cyber-AJ, is one of  <a href=\"http://www.pdf.org/en/parkinson_statistics\">10 million people</a> suffering from Parkinson’s Disease (PD) worldwide. The disease is progressive, and it is devastating.</p>
<p>Diagnosed four years ago, Johnson recently described himself as a “39 year old trapped in an 89-year-old body.” But earlier this year, his life was transformed by a technique increasingly prescribed to a subset of PD patients called deep brain stimulation (DBS).</p>
<p>In February, Johnson underwent the second of two surgeries to implant a neurostimulator in his brain. The neurostimulator is about the <a href=\"http://www.parkinson.org/Parkinson-s-Disease/Treatment/Surgical-Treatment-Options/Deep-Brain-Stimulation\">size of a stopwatch</a>, is internally wired to a pacemaker in his chest, and once switched on by a handheld remote, the device’s electrical current jams the misbehaving neurons responsible for PD’s physical symptoms.</p>
<p>Since the surgery, Johnson’s life has been better. A lot better. In a recent video posted on his blog, <a href=\"http://youngandshaky.com/\">youngandshaky.com</a>, Johnson demonstrates the power of his new device by running an experiment on camera—he turns off the juice.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/uBh2LxTW0s0\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>It’s really a remarkable video. Johnson struggles to speak and is on the verge of dropping the remote when he switches the current back on. Almost instantaneously, his tremors subside. It’s difficult not to share that deepest of deep breaths he draws into his lungs. Discomfort eased, his relief is palpable.</p>
<p>But the surgery was no walk in the park. Afterward, Johnson says he was in “obscene amounts of pain” where the “slightest whisper was like a dagger to the skull.”</p>
<p>After a few days, his medical team began adjusting the device and dialing in the optimal level of current. A strange sensation, he says, but pleasurable, as his body came “alive again after being cased in concrete for so long.”</p>
<p>For patients like Johnson, DBS can deliver dramatic results, but it <a href=\"http://www.parkinson.org/NationalParkinsonFoundation/files/0d/0dc56c7a-01b9-4533-80f5-9963901a2bb4.pdf\">isn’t appropriate</a> for everyone, nor is the surgery <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/02/23/deep-brain-stimulation-used-to-treat-early-stage-parkinsons-disease/\">risk-free</a>.</p>
<p>As Johnson warns on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/06/25/195521917/the-man-with-a-battery-operated-brain?ft=1&f=1007\">his blog</a>, “This is not a miracle cure, it is a proven treatment which happened to work for me quite spectacularly, but that was because a subset of my symptoms were ones most likely to respond to the surgery.”</p>
<p>Those wondering whether DBS might work for them should consult their doctor. But when diagnosed and targeted accurately, in combination with medication, DBS can radically reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients and their families.</p>
<p>Even with an as yet incomplete understanding of what goes on between our ears, modern neuroscience is delivering life-changing improvements for some patients.</p>
<p>As research continues, such treatments may become more commonly prescribed and increasingly effective. Cyber-AJ and his “battery operated brain” exemplify the inspiring combination of man, machine, and modern science.</p>

<p>Most of us know when we’re stressed. Physical cues like stomach butterflies, a flushed face, or muscle tension are hard to miss. Problem is, said symptoms can be very difficult to control. Once going—these things tend to snowball.</p>
<p>The <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/484175508/the-pip-a-biosensor-that-helps-you-relax-through-p?ref=category\">PIP biosensor Kickstarter</a> aims to help folks mediate stress by objectively measuring symptoms, digitally visualizing the results, and then gamifying stress reduction. It’s the latest in an avalanche of sensors aiming to increase body awareness and health.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Aio2JTpM29E\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>How does it work? The PIP measures Galvanic Skin Response—or changes in the skin’s conductivity as a stressful situation sends the heart racing and activates the sweat glands. The biosensor, held between thumb and forefinger, relays this information by bluetooth to a mobile device (Android or iOS) where an app interprets and displays it.</p>
<p>Folks interact with one of three games designed to develop biofeedback and thereby gain “conscious control over an aspect of their psycho-physiological state.” By gamifying the experience, people are motivated to play repeatedly, figure out what works, what doesn’t, and improve along the way.</p>
<p>The various pledge levels include the PIP device, games, and for top tier contributors, a trip to Ireland (no flight but two nights in a posh Dublin hotel) to meet the team, brainstorm the PIP’s future, and celebrate over a few pints at the pub. If the $100,000 goal is funded, the team hopes to deliver the devices by February, 2014.</p>
<p>It’s a cool idea, but the PIP isn’t entirely novel. Meditation is that other self-awareness “game” that’s been played for a few millennia. Thing is, meditation isn’t for everyone and can be challenging to master. Maybe by way of a few modern tricks, PIP proves the ideal gateway device to a more enlightened populace, or at the very least, a more relaxed one.</p>

You are here to change the world.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dugan is referring to Singularity University’s Graduate Studies Program (GSP) which kicked off last week in Mountain View California. The GSP gathers 80 talented students, this year from 33 countries, for the purpose of creating start up companies that will positively impact the lives of 1 billion people within ten years. Previous GSP participants have <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/companies/\">started dozens of companies that are now making an impact as part of Singularity Labs</a>, and more are sure to come out of this year’s class.  Over the course of the next ten weeks, students will hear over 500 hours of lectures from nobel prize winners, CEO’s, serial entrepreneurs, government leaders, and leading edge researchers.</p>

<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/93Ex79Pzv9Q\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Now in its 5th year, each GSP begins with a “Global Grand Challenge Week,” an introductory seminar to introduce a range of problem areas including poverty, global health, education, security, environmental issues, water, and energy. Next, students spend several weeks learning across several exponential technologies seeing massive improvements in price in performance; areas like biotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, 3D printing, medicine, and computing. The goal is to leverage these technologies in a favorable way and create companies that change the world for the better.</p>
<p>“Today a guy or a gal in a garage with access to one of these exponential technologies can touch the lives of billions on our planet,” pointed out Singularity University co-founder Peter Diamandis. “We have a moral obligation to create a world of opportunity for everyone on earth.”</p>
<p>Dr. Ray Kurzweil, co-founder and chancellor of Singularity University, was on hand to share his unique perspectives on exponential growth as well. Kurzweil has built a sterling reputation for precision accuracy in futures forecasting and technology predictions. “The world of information technology moves exponentially, and this gives me great reason for optimism,” said Kurzweil. “The world today looks nothing like it did 40 years ago and the world in 10 years will look nothing like it looks today. You all have an opportunity to create that world.”</p>
<p>“You all are doer dreamers, and I love doer dreamers,” Dr Dugan said in her closing remarks. Dr. Dugan’s final words, greeted with a standing ovation and booming applause capture the essence of the evening and offer appropriate guidance to this summer’s Graduate Studies Class. “The world has enough doers who aren’t able to dream and dreamers who are afraid to build. You all have chosen to build. Now go out and build some epic shit!”</p>

<p>Remember watching Boston Dynamics’ <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/09/10/boston-dynamics-robot-cheetah-outruns-swiftest-human/\">Cheetah robot</a> outrun Usain Bolt? Meet its little cousin, <a href=\"http://biorob.epfl.ch/cheetah\">Cheetah-cub</a>, built by EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory (Biorob). Being just a cub, it’s no Usain Bolt, but Biorob believes it’s the fastest robot of its kind.</p>
<p>Cheetah-cub is about 21 centimeters long and weighs a kilogram—roughly the same size as its namesake or, less provocatively, a common house cat. Its top speed is about 3.2 miles per hour, or seven body lengths a second.</p>
<p>Unlike the Boston Dynamics cheetah robot, Cheetah-cub more closely mimics the real thing with its spring-loaded, three-segment legs (also called “pantograph” legs).</p>
<p>Biorob attributes Cheetah-cub’s self-stabilizing gait—even at top speed—to its biomimetic leg segmentation and stride pattern. In contrast, the Boston Dynamics bot goes fast but is fairly stiff and still requires a stabilizing boom to keep it centered.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/UWlzMIl7E48\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Cheetah-cub builds on another Biorob creation, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/27/amphibious-salamander-like-robot-swims-in-water-crawls-on-land/\">Amphibot</a>, by employing central pattern generators. CPGs are specially engineered, neuron-inspired circuits capable of producing complex leg movements from simple commands from the robot’s “brain.”</p>
<p>All this is electrically controlled by an external power source, requiring a power cable.</p>
<p>Like many quadrupedal robots, Biorob says future applications may include sending these robots where other machines on wheels or tracks can’t go—for example, rough terrain on emergency or reconnaissance missions. At a trot, the robot can successfully navigate steps up to 20% of its leg length.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-wcSdiQWfUA\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>The EPFL team built the robot using mostly off-the-shelf parts, as opposed to expensive custom components. Cheetah-cub is cheap, tough, and easily assembled which, added to its other attributes, makes it a useful research design.</p>
<p>Most of all, it’s fun to watch these guys trundle around and imagine that, no matter how advanced they are now, no matter how crucial a stepping stone this research is—they’ll probably look comically awkward in a decade.</p>

<p>It’s no secret Google’s building a high-tech portfolio beyond search, from self-driving cars to artificial intelligence. But they’re also quietly building something else entirely—a futuristic new campus at NASA Moffett Field. Though the firm has been rather reserved about their new Bay View campus, a panel of designers and architects involved in the project recently gave a talk at NASA, a stone’s throw from <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/\">Singularity University</a>.</p>
<p>Down for the afternoon, I popped in to hear the gospel.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Googleplex has been well adapted to house the titan of search, but it is not a Google creation from the ground up. Said another way, that particular algorithm has not yet been optimized. So, the firm decided to undertake a building project more suitably ambitious and principled—a building of the future synthesizing the most cutting edge technology of the present.</p>
<p>Cheryl Barton, founder and creative director of SF green landscape design firm <a href=\"http://www.toocb.com/\">O|CB</a>, said, “We’re raising the bar for corporate campuses. If you’re thinking forward a hundred years, you’ve got to be a gamechanger.”</p>
<p>Like Google’s other offices, the Bay View campus will be stocked with cafes, food, and fun. But when you’re building something from the ground up, you get to arrange the structures any way you like. The buildings on the new campus are jointed, bending them around each other and central open spaces.</p>
<p>The configuration places every employee about three minutes from every other employee and encourages serendipitous interaction. If workers feel like getting somewhere more quickly, there’ll be an elevated infinity loop bike track connecting the buildings. Google’s director of campus development, John Igoe, said the goal is to create a “frictionless environment” that allows folks to focus on work.</p>
<p>Central to that vision is interior and exterior design. Indoor workspaces will be open and naturally lit whenever possible—the lighting will be dimmed or off 77% of the year. There will be no recirculated air inside. And indoor spaces will use radiant heating and cooling transmitted via a network of water pipes and warmed in part by waste heat from the buildings’ refrigeration systems.</p>
<p>All this will be powered by large scale solar (presumably not exclusively) and aims to be 46% more energy efficient than the San Francisco Bay Area average.</p>
<p>That’s the interior. What about outside?</p>
<p>Google wants the Bay View campus to work in harmony with its natural surroundings. The 2.5 acre footprint comprises only 6% of the total 42 acre site. And though the central buildings offer 1.1 million square feet of indoor office space, architectural design firm <a href=\"http://www.nbbj.com/\">NBBJ</a> added five “outdoor rooms.”</p>
<p>The design of these rooms was driven by data, a detailed study of how heat and wind flow through the area and how shade and sunlight change throughout the year.</p>
<p>The piazza will be a thriving center of activity with coffee and food trucks. The university-inspired quad will be a place to eat lunch, mingle, or host events. The garden and overlook are contemplative, landscaped outdoor rooms overlooking the bay—open places to inspire innovation or seek a moment’s silence for its own sake.</p>
<p>The wildest of these “rooms” will be an area of regenerated freshwater wetlands. Barton said a big part of the project was “taking the pulse of the site.” According to NBBJ’s Ryan Mullenix, 1/3 of the bay had been filled in by 1960 and 90% of the naturally occurring wetlands destroyed. There’s no going back, but the firm can reverse the hands of time somewhat by reintroducing wetlands onsite.</p>
<p>And in fact, these wetlands will fulfill multiple purposes, creating a positive employee experience, improving the site, and providing sustainable, green water management. Josiah Cain of <a href=\"http://www.sherwoodengineers.com/projects_streetscape.html\">Sherwood Design Engineers</a> said that together with a series of green roofs and green walls, the wetlands will also act as a natural filter for stormwater and wastewater.</p>
<p>The Q&A was short, but one local worker questioned Google’s traffic and parking plans. As many as 4,000 Google employees may descend on Moffett Field, paired with only around 2,200 parking spaces. And although they plan to widen a central access road to the complex, those already working in the area wonder whether it will be enough.</p>
<p>Igoe’s answer? Google doesn’t think the current passenger car paradigm will last. He said the firm wants 50% of its workforce to arrive by bus or bike. (Anyone who’s lived in San Francisco for any period knows well the fleet of Google buses invading the city during commuting hours.) In particular, they’d like to up the bike-to-work folks from 5% to 20%, although he didn’t elaborate on how they’ll arrive at that number.</p>
<p>It’s a big project and a costly one to boot. But Igoe wouldn’t say how much exactly—just that they took the original cost of the Googleplex, added inflation and a Google factor (for cutting-edge tech), and arrived at a competitive cost.</p>
<p>Let’s just say, not cheap but possibly very cool. And as the years pass, those tech-induced efficiency gains will likely help defray steep up-front costs.</p>

Hill" "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 16:14:31 +0000" "<p>Sometimes it’s the simplest of explanations that can change your whole perspective…at least, that’s what statistics guru Hans Rosling hopes to achieve in a new video.</p>
<p>Rosling, who is a professor of global health at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and frequent TED speaker, has been pushing data analysis at audiences for years using stunning visuals and impassioned presentations in an effort to disrupt popular yet erroneous mindsets of global issues. In 2010, he stated, “I kid you not, statistics are now the sexiest subject on the planet,” backing that statement up <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/12/09/hans-rosling-shows-you-200-years-of-global-growth-in-4-minutes-video/\">with an awesome augmented-reality fueled video for <em>The Joy of Stats</em> BBC documentary</a>.</p>
<p>The new video from Rosling, however, aims to distill the grand challenges facing the world in as straightforward and low tech approach as possible – with LEGOs. Check out the video, courtesy of <em>The Guardian</em>:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SxbprYyjyyU?rel=0\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Rosling’s message is that population growth can only be managed by both improving the living standards of the poorest in the world and persuading the wealthiest to embrace better resource distribution. In other words, somehow the increasing trend toward socioeconomic divergence must be reversed — easier said than done.</p>
<p>Perhaps Rosling will be able to release more videos in the future with proposals to these global grand challenges using LEGOs, but next time, <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/04/12/six-of-the-best-robot-videos-of-lego-mindstorms-nxt/\">he just might have to use <em>Mindstorms</em></a>.</p>

<p>From <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/21/space-exploration-on-the-cheap-kickstarter-sensation-ardusat-by-nanosatisfi-launches-in-2013/\">Ardusat</a> to <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/29/diamandis-and-planetary-resources-to-build-first-crowdfunded-public-space-telescope/\">ARKYD</a>, space startups are bringing space exploration and participation down to Earth. How? Thanks to years of microchip and sensor miniaturization, we are now making useful satellites shockingly tiny, powerful, and affordable. And recently, one design in particular, the CubeSat, has become near-ubiquitous in the race to throw open the door to space exploration.</p>
<p>According to the Space Review, as many CubeSats as have been launched in their history (<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/09/picosatellites\">50 or so</a>) are planned for launch this year (<a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2155/1\">50 to 70</a>). These days, launching a CubeSat falls within most university research budgets. And indeed, universities make up the majority of launches, though well-heeled or Kickstarter-funded students, hobbyists, and artists aren’t priced out of the equation either.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_54777\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SH-11_MiniSats-Media-22.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54777\" title=\"SH 11_MiniSats (Media) #2\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SH-11_MiniSats-Media-22.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (SSOD) used to release CubeSats from the International Space Station. Credit: NASA</p></div>
<p>The base CubeSat is 10 centimeters to a side and, depending on what you put in it, weighs up to a kilogram. CubeSats are designed to be scalable along one axis. A 2U satellite is 20 centimeters long, 3U is 30 centimeters long, and so forth.</p>
<p>Anyone can put a small satellite into orbit if they can figure out how to engineer it and pay for the ride. The only regulatory requirement in the US is a <a href=\"http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/CRSRA/generalFAQ.html\">NOAA license</a> for satellites that “sense” the Earth’s surface by way of “emitted, reflected, or diffracted” electromagnetic waves (think high powered cameras, radar, etc.).</p>
<p>Because CubeSats are a standard size and weight, they are compatible with <a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2155/1\">standard deployment systems</a> like the Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD). P-PODs accommodate three CubeSats and can be attached to rockets as secondary payloads, making it easier than ever to hitch a ride into orbit.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/50_AntgK8ZA\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>Most of today’s CubeSats ride on other commercial or government rockets at a steep per pound launch cost. But as private rocket developers like <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/\">SpaceX</a> make cheaper rockets, we’re likely to see more affordable launches in the future. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, due to launch later this year, may <a href=\"http://www.nss.org/articles/falconheavy.html\">slash launch costs</a> to under $1,000/lb.</p>
<p>Building and programming decently powerful satellites is getting cheaper and easier too. Some CubeSats even <a href=\"http://www.sstl.co.uk/divisions/earth-observation-science/science-missions/strand-nanosatellite\">boast Android phones</a> for brains. Why build hardware from scratch when smartphones contain miniature “sensors, cameras, GPS, batteries, accelerometers, compasses, [and] data storage”?</p>
<p>Or even better, if you backed the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space\">ArduSat Kickstarter</a> last year, $150 bought you a timeslot to steer their CubeSat and take 15 pictures from orbit. Or $325 booked satellite time to upload and run an experiment, application, or game using the satellite’s CPU and suite of sensors. (We visited ArduSat creator Nanosatisfi’s San Francisco workshop late last year. See <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/11/21/space-exploration-on-the-cheap-kickstarter-sensation-ardusat-by-nanosatisfi-launches-in-2013/\">here</a> for more.)</p>
<p>What other creative uses are folks finding for CubeSats?</p>
<p>Interorbital Systems, a space exploration company that specializes in small satellites, offers a <a href=\"http://www.interorbital.com/interorbital_042713_002.htm\">list of applications</a> including imaging, research, space art, and space burials. The Japanese FITSAT-1 has been <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/japanese-satellite-fitsat-1-morse-code-space_n_2615110.html\">flashing morse code</a> from orbit since late last year. Project Calliope <a href=\"http://projectcalliope.com/\">will convert</a> the ionosphere into free sound files for all to hear and perhaps mix and remix into music.</p>
<p>Maybe these seem a bit frivolous. But the fact there’s even room for frivolity is hugely promising. The more small satellites we can engineer and launch, the better and faster we can hone our designs. As space research moves beyond the elite few, the pace of space technology will accelerate. It’s about time, don’t you think?</p>

<p>If Cisco and iRobot have their way, robot CEOs may invade boardrooms from Tokyo to New York in 2014. The two companies <a href=\"http://www.irobot.com/us/Company/Press_Center/Press_Releases/Press_Release.aspx?n=061013\">recently announced</a> collaboration on the autonomous Ava 500 telepresence robot for business. The firms hope the Ava 500 will allow business people to attend daily meetings in person, across the planet—without ever changing a plane or time zone.</p>
<p>The navigation technology behind iRobot’s Roomba robot vacuum cleaner and the <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/05/18/irobots-rp-vita-telepresence-robots-start-work-at-seven-hospitals/\">RP Vita medical telepresence robot</a> will guide the five foot five inch, 100 pound Ava 500. Meanwhile, a Cisco TelePresence EX60 personal video endpoint will broadcast a worker’s face and voice from its 21.5″ screen and send back sounds and images via an onboard camera and microphone.</p>
<p>Using a special app on a tablet, remote workers will wake the robot up and tell it where to go. The Ava 500 can map and autonomously navigate the halls of its home office, freeing the telecommuter to make small talk along the way (or leave the screen off until it reaches its destination). After a meeting, the unit dutifully returns to its charging station to catch a few winks and juice up for its next appointment.</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/hVviDvsBQ78\" height=\"326\" width=\"580\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>
<p>iRobot CEO, Colin Angle, told the <em>Boston Herald</em> the Ava 500 gives folks the chance to be in the same room as the people they’re meeting, to see facial expressions, and to go in the hall after for a private chat. Angie Mistretta, director of telepresence solutions at Cisco, says, “The real value of the robot is that spontaneity.”</p>
<p>The question is whether that spontaneity is worth the robot’s <a href=\"http://bostonherald.com/business/technology/technology_news/2013/06/irobot_to_unveil_virtual_business_partner\">$70,000 price tag</a> (or $2,000 – $2,500 a month to rent). iRobot and Cisco are targeting executives, corporate trainers, site inspectors, and remote employees. Travel costs for these folks can stack up fast. If Ava 500 saves even a few trips a month, the robot could pay its way.</p>
<p>But businesses are cost cutting machines. If telepresence robots are attractive at $70,000, then they’re even more appealing at $7,000, and exponentially sexier as the price tag approaches $0. And already, firms can order a simpler telepresence robot from <a href=\"http://www.doublerobotics.com/\">Double Robotics</a> for $2,599. Businesses may be willing to sacrifice a little screen real estate and autonomous navigation for $67,000 in saved costs.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_63552\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SH-135_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-63552\" alt=\"Double Robotics iPad telepresence robot.\" src=\"http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SH-135_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Double Robotics iPad telepresence robot.</p></div>
<p>And they may not need to make that sacrifice very long. Advanced AI and robotics are entering the consumer market at drastically reduced prices.</p>
<p>We <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2013/06/11/ai-startup-anki-debuts-at-wwdc-wows-with-impressive-tech-50-million-in-funding/\">recently wrote</a> about AI startup Anki. Anki’s robot cars drive themselves around a track at top speed, avoiding each other, the wall, making evasive maneuvers—all this runs on iOS with an expected cost of $200. But Anki isn’t just about toy cars. It’s an iOS-powered consumer AI and robotics platform.</p>
<p>Such technology will just as easily guide an autonomous telepresence robot through the office. And soon. Offering enterprise solutions at enterprise prices in a world where AI and robotics are hitting consumer markets at consumer prices—how long will such products make sense?</p>

<p>It’s 22 minutes of awesomeness about what small teams of passionate people are able to accomplish that is bound to inspire.</p>
<p>Bloomberg technology reporter Rachel Crane was on-site at SU’s Silicon Valley campus to speak with co-founders Ray Kurzweil and Peter Diamandis, CEO Rob Nail, and representatives of SU Labs startups about the impact and opportunities resulting from technology advancing at an exponential rate. Described as a place “where the world’s brightest minds convene to attack the world’s toughest challenges,” the program gives an incredible insider view of the amazing technologies emerging through Singularity University. Efforts such as the development of zero-gravity 3D printing from Made in Space and tricorder-like body scanning from Scanadu hold great promise for what exponential growth and technological progress will mean for everyone.</p>
