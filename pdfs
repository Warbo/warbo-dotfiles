# PDFs we'd like open. Used by 'pdfs' command, which will try to keep one copy
# of each PDF open. The first column is a string to identify this PDF in the
# output of 'ps auxww'; if it's found, along with 'mupdf-x11', we assume it's
# already open. The second column is the PDF's path. For Nix build products, the
# 'result' symlink can be used to ensure the latest version is always used.
