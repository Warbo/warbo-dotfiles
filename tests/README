# Simple test suite #

I use this as a high-level test harness, testing as many of my projects as
possible; like a poor man's continuous integration server.

It's really simple:

 - Anything in scripts/ is a test
 - A test passes if its exit code is zero
 - A test fails if its exit code is non-zero
 - To execute a single test, just run it, since they're just regular scripts
 - To run the suite, run ./run
 - Successful tests get a file put in results/pass/; deleting these forces the
   tests to re-run
