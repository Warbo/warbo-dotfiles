# Tab-separated instructions for scraping podcasts:
#  - The first column is the feed directory (we'll look for episodes in new/)
#  - The second column is the audio directory, to save MP3s into
#  - All remaining arguments are regular expressions, for narrowing down the URL
#    of the MP3 to fetch. We look through each maildir entry for the first URL
#    (normally the guid of that RSS item). We fetch that URL, then apply these
#    regular expressions one by one to go from the HTML down to the MP3 URL.
