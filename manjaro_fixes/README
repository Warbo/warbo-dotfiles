## Fixes for Manjaro on PinePhone ##

Try to implement as much as possible using Nix/HomeManager. This directory is to
collect whatever can't be done that way.

## Charging ##

The `input_current_limit` of the PinePhone's USB port may default to 0.5V when
a cable gets plugged in. This is too low to charge, so we unconditionally bump
it to 3V using `bump-input-current-limit.sh`, which gets run automatically by
the UDev rule `95-bump-input-current-limit.rules`, which needs to be symlinked
into `/etc/udev/rules.d/`

### External Monitor ###

Gnome/Phosh is bad at handling external monitors: it forgets their orientation,
it has a limited selection of scaling values, etc. Also, external monitors can
sometimes glitch on the PinePhone, which requires some way to "reset" them.

We work around these problems with three parts:

 - A `fix` command, managed HomeManager. This can be run manually (e.g. Alt-F2)
 - A `fix-monitor.service` SystemD service, also managed by HomeManager. That
   just runs the `fix` command as a "oneshot" service.
 - A `95-monitor-hotplug.rules` UDev rule. This can't be managed by HomeManager
   so it lives in here and must be symlinked into `/etc/udev/rules.d/`. It
   starts `fix-monitor.service` whenever the graphics card detects a change.

Note that `95-monitor-hotplug.rules` can't simply call `fix`, since UDev rules
are blocking: the `fix` script tries to "turn off and on" the graphics setup,
but those changes won't get processed while this handler is still running. Also,
UDev handlers (and their spawned processes) are killed after a few seconds,
which is not long enough for `fix` to run (as it waits for the graphics changes
to take effect). Hence we have it non-blockingly start `fix-monitor.service`.

Here are some example journald logs for monitor glitching (screen going blank
then recovering):
